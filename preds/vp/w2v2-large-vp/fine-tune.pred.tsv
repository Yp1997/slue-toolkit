20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:24:09_6.ogg	it comes after four years of negotiation with the council and for that it is a major achievement
20160413-0900-PLENARY-17-en_20160413-15:24:09_7.ogg	the regulation gives eu citizens new positive rights including the ability to know when your data has been hacked the use of plain language and requests for personal data the appointment of data protection officers and the fines which really were needed because now people know that this is legislation that will last and stand the test of time

20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-10:02:05_6.ogg	it was raised as an issue last year at the transport council

20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:53:43_10.ogg	the compensation offered to the passengers on that flight was a big fat zero
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:53:43_4.ogg	because the airlines claime every delay or concelation is due to force masure or extraordinary circumstances and if you challenge that view you are ttold  will see you in court

20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:53:43_9.ogg	bt i say to this parliament today and to the aviation industry out there that this regulation and report is about passenger rights not airline rights and should be supported by the whole house finally can i thank monocirlines for showing me in practical terms why this regulation had to be amended and e lopholes closed after a dreadful experience coming back a mer twenty six ors late from tenearif in august wo thousand and twelve
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:53:43_1.ogg	this report will put an end to this type of happy time that the airlines have enjoyed up to now

20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:17:12_3.ogg	so this was considerably better than the starting point of the commission which was five ours we are also able to support the narrowing of the extraordinary circumstances to stop airlines hiding behind this excuse to avoid
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:17:12_1.ogg	i would like to thank the rapportur for his very constructive approach and i am very pleased to say that we have been able to change the emphasis the commission proposal from one which was largely pro industry pro airline to one which is much more pro passenger and that is e version wewill vote on today although my group's view wathte compensation should be payed after one hour was not carried
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-10:07:51_2.ogg	this is a good thing especially for an iland nation like ireland which depends a lot on aviation
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-10:07:51_4.ogg	since the entry into force of the regulation in two thousand and four there are problems in relation to the variation interpretations resulting from greay zones and gaps in the current two thousand and four regulation

20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-10:07:51_5.ogg	passengers have difficulty first of all in enforcing their rights when air carriers in breach of the legislation and on many occasions passengers are not even aware of their rights as airlines are not providing the information needed
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:40:43_1.ogg	the commission stupidly and predictably gave the spanish government about six week's notice so for the purpose of that one visit the spanish authorities for want of a better word cleaned up their act the reality is that these delays are still going on and you and your colleagues should be hartily ashamed of yourselves
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-10:15:50_1.ogg	too often airlines fail to offer passengers the assistance that current eu legislation binds them to exploiting the gas in enforcement by national enforcement bodies exploiting passenger's lack of knowledge of their rights of issues of legal interpretation

20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:29:58_3.ogg	an important part of doing this is by ensuring that our workforce andffeel confident and indeed foreign visitors feel confident to travel by air
20140205-0900-PLENARY-3-en_20140205-09:29:58_4.ogg	this report would give better protection by ensuring that passengers subject to long delays receive the same rights to compensation as those suffering cancelations it would also extend the right to accomoaccomodation in these cases and emphasise support for disabled passengers
