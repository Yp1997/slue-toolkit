20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_0.ogg	mr president i will be voting against this report and this proposed directive for three reason
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_1.ogg	first of all i desent from the belief that the eu rather than national governments should be legislating on these issues believing every member state is best placed to decide if it needs to strengthen such legislation
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_2.ogg	if ever there was a subsiduarity isse this should be it
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_3.ogg	my second reason is that the new offence of harasment has the allarming prospect of in fact curbing the rights in respect of freedom of speech and freedom of religion particularly for those who proclaim a christian message
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_4.ogg	christians preaching the gospol particularly in a public plathe to people from other fath who take offence and who claim it as an assult on their dignity could be breaching this law
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_6.ogg	the third reason is that the measures within the directive are disproportionate and inadequately balanced
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_7.ogg	it compels the christian printer for example to accept an order to print material which ofends his religious beliefs whereas he should be free to conduct his business according to his concience
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:18:07_8.ogg	withhout essential balancing mechanisms this directive will become an instrument which infact creates discrimination
20090401-0900-PLENARY-13-en_20090401-18:59:10_3.ogg	i strongly believe that no person should ever be discriminated against based on his or her religion or belief disability and age
