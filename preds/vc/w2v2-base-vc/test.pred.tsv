id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00001.flac	very often i am and then sometimes i'm not and when i catch myself realizing that i have reverted back into being remains
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00002.flac	to a family that would use that eventually end up using me as
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00004.flac	so this black family who had two teenage children
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00005.flac	i don't i know people don't believe it when i say i don't know how old i am but i really i know somewhere i'm way past
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00006.flac	but we passed fifty but i was really still about five six
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00007.flac	she tried and there were times when the whole family was gone into the fields or something like that harvesting picking cotton whatever they were doing and we were left in the house alone the two teenagers would tie in what we call a cross
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00008.flac	and then time to a tree and with a peach tree switch they would bet my bottom until i was bleeding and i only had one thing to wear and that was also made of potato
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00009.flac	you talking about it like we are talking about it now and you try to not get emotional about it but all of a sudden those feelings
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00010.flac	the idea of the time to a tree and you're not notable
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00011.flac	strict man was a very tall lady
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00012.flac	and also very fair in complexion she's hajek very majestic looking i was definitely afraid of her
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00013.flac	duty you know because she got a letter from the south that told her that if i was not taken away from this family that they would either starve me to death or beat me to death
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00014.flac	and therefore she decided that she would take me on into new york but she wasn't any better she
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00015.flac	i was trying to get away from her but where do you go what do you do
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00016.flac	and whenever i had a few pennies i could then it was some way it was a nickel for
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00017.flac	and the other hoping that the conductor wouldn't see me because they used to have
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00018.flac	everything you possibly could i could possibly find to hide behind because i never have been with that kind of security within earth that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted i don't think that in myself and my self contest and when i'm writing the book when i was writing the book is
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00019.flac	the urge that i really know i am inside of myself and not wearing any makeup and not caring about what i look like
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00020.flac	nobody wants you and she's trying so hard to find somebody that's here it's all right you want to but nobody's done that yet maybe
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00021.flac	never touched me it was said ruby rose and they were
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00022.flac	real love strong love that men have had for me two of them john berry and third and
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00023.flac	particularly as boys who come from extremely wealthy family and they are the only son
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00024.flac	everybody knows in past fifty whatever the number may be does not seem to matter to them
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00025.flac	no matter how hard you try not to it's still there i'm not
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00026.flac	i 'm very glad that she's still a part of me and i'm very glad that she would always be a part of me
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00027.flac	cause she helps me do what she knows i have to do out there on that stage because there is where my survival is with that public and with those who who know me well enough too
id10270_5sJomL_D0_g_00001.flac	except the part because something is in you that says you are that character and if you have a little bit of a difficult time finding it you will find it eventually it may take you up
id10270_5sJomL_D0_g_00002.flac	you know where to find the character but you will but that character to me was so
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00001.flac	being as physically huge as he was and having to well at that time
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00002.flac	still and to work with him was not always the most exciting thing in the world in the matter
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00003.flac	exciting but it was a very scary and at the same at the same time it was very
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00004.flac	four of the three of them and me would take me to lunch at the
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00005.flac	coffee in south carolina and as a result you do what you are told to do not what you want to do
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00006.flac	and i think that i was afraid always to exercise my feelings about anything because i thought
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00007.flac	not only think about taking care of children my mother had died or whoever was that was saying that she was my mother who had given me away to so many people at the time down south so she brought me up north my anti
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00008.flac	no it's not for me i'm a catherine down a dancer and madonna has sent me out to get this meh
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00009.flac	instinctively using that animal instinct that i had when i was a child in the south because being given away you know you have to rely on whatever
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00010.flac	and life has been so much fun for me but to be able to do that to make fun
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00011.flac	because i can t myself i can play with my mind
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00012.flac	taking me as something that is insulting them but a cat woman to me was really one of the best things i've ever done
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00013.flac	and i don't think that when people are i cannot talk for other actors but when i am called on to do
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00014.flac	because i'm a human being i'm an american citizen i happened to love this country and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00015.flac	came back to america and that's when we had this tremendous discussion all the time as a matter of fact the black panthers
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00016.flac	that they would get me again but i stood my ground and walked from the seventh avenue is hotel
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00017.flac	to all by myself back to the apollo theater and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00018.flac	and no matter how many words they threw at me i stood my ground and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00019.flac	said why is there so much leaning
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00020.flac	different areas of the united states among the young people i still have an organization in what's called
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00021.flac	where we bring the young people in to teach them physical therapist the dancer as well as other things but this luncheon was with us fifty women who were to disgust a problem
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00022.flac	when the time came i rose raised my hand and told miss johnson what the young boys of this country had told
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00023.flac	us to be involved there it was a dishonorable war it was an unviable war so when i raised my hand and told miss johnson what those boys had to
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00024.flac	teams that within two hours i was out of work into nited states according to
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00025.flac	because i believe that if you get an education you can cross
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00026.flac	you have that freedom of freedom of speech freedom
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00027.flac	and as i said we in our country and solve our own problems on our own home
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00028.flac	and therefore what we feel in our own country should be
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00029.flac	the ambassador hotel in los angeles and i called them
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00030.flac	over the contract to see that everything was so intense and they said
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00031.flac	came to my house in beverly hills and asked me if i would do so alone
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00032.flac	the number of character she's not number one two three or four but i never worried about whether you are they
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00033.flac	we live in a free democratic world and unless we are exercising those freedoms
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00034.flac	this is what this country is all about speak out and do unto others as you would have them
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00035.flac	for the world and that's one of the reasons why i wrote this book now that's out rejuvenate it's never too late because those who have come
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00036.flac	to us and the value of that life and if we didn't do that we were absolutely out of our minds and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00037.flac	you can break through barriers once you've had the education but go for what you've really
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00038.flac	if you go for what you really love and what you really want to do it you do a better job and money will always come and make you comfortable
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00001.flac	what is now becoming more focused into the realization of the black people that they too must become and behave the exercise their integral part of it
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00002.flac	i think that somebody who should be running this country should be somebody who knows how to be a business person who realizes that a business should be
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00003.flac	is always at a deficit and the people of the country are constantly being forced into paying off the depths of the politicians who we
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00004.flac	and it's about time that we realized that like it says
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00005.flac	stand the chance of the possibility of becoming president of the united
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00006.flac	to be in that position they have to know about how to take care of business they have to know how to
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00007.flac	the blacks or the italians or whatever when we turned about america i thought there
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00008.flac	i don't want any favors as a person of color i'm sure that the japanese or the i don't know about the japanese they say you want ever
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00009.flac	so interesting to me that every time i leave this country and i come back i find that i feel more like a fortner in my own country than i did from them
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00010.flac	taking over very suddenly they like the man said you won't have the need us to take over america we will just walk in and this
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00011.flac	yes everywhere and i keep my eyes open all the time and you talk to people of the countries who you can get
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00012.flac	knowledge from not from politicians you're not gonna get anything from politicians because they're very cold called diplomatic but the people the real people that's why i take my chances and going to for countries and talking to the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00013.flac	then they will or more have to tell you the truth but why aren't they giving away this land everything has to seemingly is dealing with what the bible says the religion says this piece of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00014.flac	to us and there is and always a bottom line of religious ism that says we have the right to this land god
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00015.flac	erica so would would i could i go to the government and say i want my land back
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00016.flac	the plaza hotel when i was singing one night and they were like twenty seats empty directly in front of me and they came in all of them because they were saving
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00017.flac	other kings geron's family and i stopped the show and waited until each one of them sat down and they had all of this jus on because it was one of those people not the the age but one of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00018.flac	members of his family i won't mention the name he had he would hire models and then he would go to interact and tiny
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00019.flac	and so i waited until they were all seated down then they had their little coffee
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00020.flac	that and then i said to him in turkish to go to them and he said he looked at me and at the end of the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00021.flac	i don't really think i'm looking for anything special except maybe a good one because i'm a dirt person
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00022.flac	i know if i have a piece of land i will never go hungry because i know very much to be
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00023.flac	if someone gave it to me but it's more than it will be a hack
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00024.flac	now that's sort of thing but when i came out of the south into new york being brought there by my and who took me out of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00025.flac	after my mother gave me to this family who was not very nice to me because i'm not the right color to be accepted by them
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00026.flac	to be accepted by the whites and you're on top of all of that is a bastard child out
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00027.flac	no but he wants you but if you're given away then the family or whoever you're given a way to use you as a work mule and of course if there was food i got it if there was no food then i was the last one to be fed so between the animals the cats and the dogs and myself
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00028.flac	also i learned how to survive from the forest and from the dirt my and brought me from
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00029.flac	the garbage cans and sleeping on the subway until i found her way into the cathrin don company by having an audit
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00030.flac	and when i asked him what is the character about what kind of person i am how all the women is she and he said you are all women you represent all women of all
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00031.flac	and that's why i chose you to do this part because you're the most exciting creature i've ever
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00032.flac	years i began to understand what he meant because
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00033.flac	from my side that he felt about me and to me an exciting person is knowing one of them
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00034.flac	things about an exciting person to me is knowing when to say something and when not to say something and if you have something to say and you don't know how to say then the best thing to do is be quiet
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00035.flac	and though they said it was very exciting from the artist
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00036.flac	pemex gordon after i was a plot levers mex gorden who on the blue angel called
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00037.flac	six weeks or two months later because i was in new york i had no way of getting back to paris nobody even the william morris agent didn't remember my name they didn't who adele was and they were the ones who brought me to america leaders and the next
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00038.flac	she was in it but it was june carron gram and myself because we sat around i was
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00039.flac	so forth and so on i was the best dress paper in paris because people like jack path bumbling
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00040.flac	like my body and they liked me as a personality so they would call me and they would give me the clothes that they thought were
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00041.flac	he should still have a kind of show like that we should still have a kind of show like japan
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00042.flac	because they're intelligent people what happened to these intelligent writers who have you know because a show like jack par is not
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00043.flac	today i think he will always be able to make a good providing so she's got it
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00044.flac	life is different every day the words may be the same but there is a lot of hands to a lot of all
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00045.flac	and last night it was a mice from star trek
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00046.flac	girl and call runner's wife was there last night
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00047.flac	knowing that i don't like to know before because i get too nervous as it's wonderful exciting that my goodness that person came to see me you know that you know but it's
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00048.flac	life here to love and here's to you because after all is said and done
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00049.flac	i know now what i'm i i have achieved than i know more of where i want to go and i am now very sensitive to my own
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00050.flac	who um content maybe who were thieves etcetera and that's why i'm saying to you skip i bought thank goodness i bought a realist because that that i know how to survive on but you never know
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00051.flac	from one moment to the other it depends on what you do with your life which becomes the most valuable thing and what you've done with your life for me i feel there's always another tomorrow
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00052.flac	well i'm not saying yes i know i don't know what happens tomorrow but i don't have any man in my life
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00053.flac	and the mothers became the most domineering situation that cut off the relationships and the ones that i thought
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00054.flac	of him and his people to advise him to do that because i think it's about time also that two different
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00055.flac	culture too many races too many groups to many this is too many hats
id10270_OXdd7Gmluts_00001.flac	leaving the company i didn't have enough hooper on my own to do that at the time but when men forced me to by saying i do
id10270_OXdd7Gmluts_00003.flac	is from that child of the south carolina when nobody
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00001.flac	getting to a point in their lives where they are just about able to start paying back their parents or whatever they do
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00002.flac	of the rejection that she had when she was a child and now that she
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00003.flac	it's good for me to be a stereotype and that's what i am a fan
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00004.flac	age thirteen fourteen years old i wanna be evil
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00005.flac	with the man whereby i wanna be able to playing with a child so to speak for the
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00006.flac	the cameras in to fall back and it's true the cameras had to close up becaus
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00007.flac	they couldn't find people as a son who on the plate hotel once and
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00008.flac	every step of the way and i do realize it don't have to make myself to that every step
id10270_OmSWVqpb-N0_00001.flac	i think that when i started you sing songs like that it was or who pushed those
id10270_PXmaB6Ui0fE_00001.flac	the mechanisms behind the discos because we do not
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00001.flac	and i came across the letter that jack anderson wrote me said these are your files that we found
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00002.flac	i requested by ladybird and president johnson
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00003.flac	the united states so that i would be not seen and therefore i'm
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00004.flac	my opinions about the problems among the young people of america at that time that was the question of the luncheon and fifty of us ladies who were in the different communities across america and me and saw also increased
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00005.flac	in working with these people all the time and therefore i know what their feelings are and when they ask the question about
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00006.flac	my getting a good credit for putting flowers at sixty
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00007.flac	place that i can remember he did not have a return engagement and when i was not asked
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00008.flac	and maybe my popularity is waiting and so far that does happen and i started to begin
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00009.flac	called me in nineteen seventy four january and said this is what we found
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00010.flac	anywhere and therefore you're that's why you're having a part time
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00011.flac	or they were claiming that they were communist or something like this and when they couldn't find anything on
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00012.flac	and make you a very unpopular name in the eye of the public and in the minds of the public and
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00013.flac	that they're still doing it if they want to get rid of you they'll find your way to get to you and the best way to do it is
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00014.flac	worked with just as they did with the anti american comity i was shocked when i came back to america in nine
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00015.flac	this kind of thing is happening to us we fought a war against things like this with the
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00016.flac	something i still can't believe it and you never know if it is still going on because my side of the story was never really told what was i going to do
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00017.flac	wanted me to do that and i said i think they should apologize that american people because they know we should not be involved in that war
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00018.flac	and i don't understand how someone like this the man who had the faith of the young boys of this country in the palm of his
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00019.flac	but morally whatever it is we're not suppose that we shouldn't be
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00020.flac	had lost his job which i lost my job i still did it i didn't know i was going to lose my
id10270_zjwijMp0Qyw_00001.flac	and i'm an american citizen i happen to love this country and i know that we have our struggles
id10270_zjwijMp0Qyw_00002.flac	because being as physically huge as he was to work with him was not always the most exciting thing in the world in the matter
id10270_zjwijMp0Qyw_00003.flac	because i believe that if you get an education you can
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00001.flac	well i mean we were on the break right now and we finished uh in march and i went
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00002.flac	an english a movie an english film called a shell girl which was like a romantic comedy kind of
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00003.flac	um so that was a lot of fun it was a good change and um
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00004.flac	back to shoot the fourth season in july in and we're doing a couple days in paris which i'm uh very excited about love paris so
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00005.flac	he took care of me kept me out of trouble these wonderful
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00006.flac	how many people can say i've done that so uh said that was that was that was fantastic and um was really pleased with the way they were brought everything together i think it was probably the best one we've had of um of the three seasons so um so yeah
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00007.flac	i mean i don't know i mean i really don't know what's what's going on because we haven't had the script i mean maybe
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00008.flac	all they meant to be together all they know you know like bad for each other cause it looks like
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00009.flac	its fine fire with fire i know they have great fun working as i said so it
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00010.flac	great partnerships you know the crime fighting or something like that or
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00011.flac	a bony inclined a little of it so they the you know they bounced off one another they um i think
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00012.flac	married well i mean he was going and proposed on the third season you know that was his his big step but maybe it was a good
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00013.flac	he saw he had a very little consideration and respect for uh for others and enjoyed playing games with people and manipulation but then that kind of evolved
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00014.flac	that one and fall in love with um with blair and had this relationship but of course his other u s other side to his pers personality kind of um
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00015.flac	some self destruction or destruction of the u of their bond of their relationships
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00016.flac	um so we've seen him we've seen him progress we've seen him grow i think he's i think he's learned
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00017.flac	i think it's um i think it's a mix thing really i mean you know
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00018.flac	it's it's a progression of somebody's life almost you know it's people change to go through differ
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00019.flac	and then mash and stefanie came off the the they brought everything they bought their built in fan base
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00020.flac	active i think never entertaining value so i mean i think all of these things
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00021.flac	the final season i don't know man i mean i mean we've got this
id10271_37nktPRUJ58_00001.flac	the brandy samsung smartphone to um to take out and about with me when i'm here and doing this kind of like
id10271_37nktPRUJ58_00002.flac	and uh hit people back i mean the been pretty extravagant season you know i mean i kind of ended
id10271_37nktPRUJ58_00003.flac	and lots of his behavior with regard to his relationship
id10271_8gcdEYAKNkE_00001.flac	the gossip going everywhere because it means the show is getting the attention it deserves a people
id10271_EOQXxK1whgU_00001.flac	and here i was in the very best in site last night and uh we did we did a signing and um i got
id10271_EOQXxK1whgU_00002.flac	i got a chance to met all the people down there it was a crazy show of support you know so many people came out so it's been a
id10271_EOQXxK1whgU_00003.flac	uh playing somebody younger than myself you know we actually have to shave every day which can be a very irritating
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00001.flac	nice charming script definitely and um charming nice character to play um and then
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00002.flac	with where we're a nice change in dad from uh from the stuff had been doing been working
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00003.flac	doing that season so um yes it was a nice
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00004.flac	no i mean it's like um it was great
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00005.flac	and watching me watching the football so it was a good time but i think um i think the girls are tellingly there it was definitely tainted
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00006.flac	a little bit yeah yeah i play a little bit i've i've got a very nice
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00007.flac	eighteen i was eleven with the school we used to go on school trips around europe so
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00008.flac	so yeah hugely i think you know it was something that was very fitting um for me in that respect
id10271_OZcAiOZBNjQ_00001.flac	um i kind of not not really fell into i was you know in and around it as
id10271_PMWQqW_ia58_00001.flac	everything really kind of was draining i think everyone was dying everyone was really really am pleased to us
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00001.flac	limits but um now what we've experienced is you know everyone's kind of everyone who's seen it is
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00002.flac	yeah my character's a bit of the habit of the bad boy um but you know i mean there's a bunch of elements to it that never made it attractive to
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00003.flac	very uh very bad relationship with his father so he's running through all the
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00004.flac	in um in that hand and you know my answer and my response is away
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00005.flac	you know the issues of growing up dealing with relationships dealing with families and so for me i feel
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00006.flac	no matter who you are once you kind of read between the lions and get into the show a little more
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00007.flac	it would be to keep being involved in exciting projects you work with people who are at the top of the
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00008.flac	game um we are then i'm gonna be involved in we played just before the los angeles galaxy play um it's next saturday

id10271_Zjc7Xy7aT8c_00003.flac	show that they so we left england to do something something that they did five hundred years
id10271_Zjc7Xy7aT8c_00004.flac	and you got these amazing structures you know with the hotels and everyting they just seemed like such as

id10271__pOfzIZVLFQ_00001.flac	yeah i think we're very different places have very different countries and it's it's a great thing for me to be
id10271_djK87iSSKQo_00001.flac	you know the critical sites um it's uh it's good fun
id10271_gO805KoL2RM_00001.flac	season and we had such a kind of spectacular canaston going and you know will they want they finally get back together after all the drama that navel throughout the past year so well
id10271_gO805KoL2RM_00002.flac	an absolute role it's been fantastic i mean at first uh you kind of a little bit of everything and i mean i still minor off
id10271_gO805KoL2RM_00003.flac	stuff that's going on but you just take a day by day and enjoy it and i get to meet wonderful people and go to wonderful places so
id10271_gO805KoL2RM_00004.flac	so i went in and read for both and i read in an english accent as well which could have been
id10271_gO805KoL2RM_00005.flac	i just found myself being so busy tied up with the show and everything like that you know music i absolutely adore i mean as i'm sure we all do and um it was something that i really
id10271_gO805KoL2RM_00006.flac	i didn't really see what kind of make it a career or a way to make it you're a living you know so

id10271_zWyD72sHVwA_00002.flac	more support in in family and i think that's something that he's always missed you know so i think that holds a very um attractive
id10271_zWyD72sHVwA_00003.flac	just where these fantastic since um i don't think the the thing that's fantastic is it's not just about

id10272_wb6ligRbbZ4_00010.flac	bras going out to the families of those who have family members
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00001.flac	to come through parents and stuff um he he had that and some nurturing that he just pushed it and made it work we when i was at uh stand up workshop learning to do stand up because i only did sketches he was down there were different types of stand ups you could be you could choose one and one was the sort of godlike genius and that was the robin will you can head to that but only if you're crazy you had
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00002.flac	he could have done it more because i think as in america if you if you get successful in comedy you will go into a television series of a film series and that becomes key and it's a different it's a different thing to stand up so i feel he did occasional uh stand up tours after taking off into such a uh such a huge way but not not all the time it was he was so wonderful at it i i don't actually know why he didn't come back to
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00003.flac	that was that was just robin he was he was a nice guy i when i first met him i felt
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00004.flac	i he was just very welcoming and and i pushed i said and can you watch my video and he watched it immediately which was which was very hard you would expect a lot of pull back on that but he was just
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00005.flac	a decent person and for a lot of us
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00006.flac	clinical and some people have in some people down and it just it's a disease in it
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00007.flac	all of us comedians to but he he was making himself off i'm pretty sure he was performing he was the first person in his audience um when i did this film
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00008.flac	would have done he would have just gone off and they said the script would ve been here and he would've gone to the seven ways
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00009.flac	can't actually try and be someone you can't say i want to be that case you can you can add little bits on to your own style but it was more sort of woodland with um billy cone and and richard prior mixed in but it's just that he did hit this god like genius place of being able to do anything and it was political and it was faster it was impressions and he would run through
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00010.flac	don't usually move off the stage um he just had this ability to take a room and uh
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00011.flac	he's just he's just right up there i mean it's um um you know uh there should never be number one in creative things but he's in the top ten of all time um and maybe the top five it's just
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00012.flac	it is rather tragic i didn't want to come in here and do this but i thought i was discussing this steve coin whether i should do it because it looks sometimes it was everyone jumps on telly talks about people but i just wanted to say
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00001.flac	i announced five years ago that i'd run in my twenty twenty so that's kind of weird cause you know me
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00002.flac	this will be the fourth when i get that and then russia well i just i just i'm kind of ambitious i i'm positive on people i want me to do well i want everyone to do well i hate the right wing i hate u religious
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00003.flac	if your cabinet minister that is a high position of power but it's more of a child for london you're in charge of transport and police but once you've chosen
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00004.flac	well he is sent to write so i i'm okay with that but he's not my party uh it's more about the few than the many um and he said he wouldn't take part in the national helper ice and he sort of did and so i'm
id10273_3i_6peYQarY_00001.flac	italian and if you say the big three three syllables or more if you just say it with a different accent is probably the same way transportation
id10273_58VB-LYIoRM_00001.flac	french i gonna do german and danish do good things but you know i just thought they spent all this time in english it would be
id10273_58VB-LYIoRM_00002.flac	though at the moment it's just as the action got a cat so we didn't even talk about that
id10273_58VB-LYIoRM_00003.flac	and the sixty million and you think is that too
id10273_58VB-LYIoRM_00004.flac	it was i don't know what to say i want i asked steven to
id10273_58VB-LYIoRM_00005.flac	they are interest actually most you know cause they they are like flies without a mission
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00001.flac	well i think my thing is i know everyone's gone kind of weird but if your if your up doesn't make it then don't think the world's gonna make it we gotta learn what together in some shape or form and britain's got to be at the set for that
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00002.flac	and we all come out of africa and we come from the same people so we were a small group of ten thousand
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00003.flac	the mandela as i tried to run twenty seven twenty seven days
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00004.flac	it was gonna kill me so uh it's uh it was a prescription
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00005.flac	no not a fan fact was he was going five miles an hour he was going five miles but straight for me i mean this is the
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00006.flac	we live in that live and let's do our lives and we don't get involved we don't get that active and so we have to get acted to to keep fighting
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00007.flac	most extended i'm claiming it's the most extensive come forever i just go around claiming records and
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00008.flac	came over uh south africans canadians or strains are coming in the coming
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00009.flac	getting a treat for it they say we know you you know so do some good stuff you know your stuff on just
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00010.flac	that was only half full it was raining i thought it was gonna be miserable but because i got to do need not many people came down there they went
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00011.flac	well i hope that i mean i think i could get in i could get elected and then people start grumbling and say oh you interesting before and it's boring now cause i got
id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00012.flac	so that he keeps doing uh his talk show for some time there
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00001.flac	actually when it comes to genitalia forgetting too that what's
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00002.flac	the audience there's this thing of dumbing down they talk about in television going for the lowest common denominator in the highest common denominator and i assume the intelligence of the audience and if i played an audience that wasn't a sharp they would probably lynch me cause they would say talking about but i assume people watched the whole buch of films they can get references to history politics obscure things cause i tend to
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00003.flac	i don't know enormous but i do take in a lot of facts but i tend to just throw out small facts that i've learned which
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00004.flac	and the changes in technology equals the future this is my sort of there so if you study the past you get the future and you can work
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00005.flac	taking and i'm very positive about the union so um i think it's the way that if humans aren't
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00006.flac	people say that you people say you you won't remember much of that i remember that and everything before that
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00007.flac	lemonade and baskets and some other kids with it and other parents of that so it was quite weird it's like
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00008.flac	i think if if you're alternate sexuality gay lesbian transgender you
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00009.flac	not wildly emotional you know not great at sensing stars and designs my senses
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00010.flac	women ten game i think have their senses more heightened men have them lowered but maybe it more
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00011.flac	just i have two sort of modes i just go along
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00012.flac	and i you know there's no shame there's no there's guilt in shame or the two adjectives you get free with
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00014.flac	not the case even though you know obviously makes an extra bit of something that goes with it but
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00015.flac	you know it's your gay or lesbian lot of them do kiss keep it
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00016.flac	so it it it wasn't the thing that made it happen it's just
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00017.flac	well yeah i've always wanna have boots but you know i look kind of blossom
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00018.flac	lots of you know it's basically a lot of teenage girls that were so i have and i was thinking
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00019.flac	and they they said you can you go to university and we pay you a wage
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00020.flac	and then you you give three years to the army after that so i i seriously considered that cause i am i'm quite military in my head
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00021.flac	i 'm very strategic if you think of you know some people's careers go great and it goes off they go and then when they are off they don't know how
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00022.flac	get all this rationalized which could be in the constituent i don't i don't know what's i've done to the constitution but i have really it's also boring politics is incredibly tedious that's what most people
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00023.flac	she and my i've a very um i'm a popcorn eating film watcher so i find politics fascinating interesting i know it but it
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00024.flac	uh the fun way to make politics exciting is to have a war well what it was very good it was great films came out of that fifty million people dead and we decided was his best not to do this anymore
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00025.flac	bang to many many centuries you know and we kept doing this over
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00026.flac	i mean i think we need to have a sort of supreme counseling you where you have all the heads of all the countries
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00027.flac	what a waste of space i mean she's very tough and firm she's very you know hit the light i feel so she's kind you know picked up a few things from out of there
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00028.flac	isn't she she got no imagination cause you can get democracy people speaking different languages
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00029.flac	maybe she's just she wasn't a lazy person i couldn't say that but the lack of
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00030.flac	and i feel since ninety forty five years in the world is like an abomination what are these people doing here
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00032.flac	doing it this should have been so we need to have the international criminal court we need to have that with teeth all dictators should immediately go and have life imprisonment you don't even need to try them if you think about it because you don't need to prove that the dictators they're already dictators so
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00033.flac	on the ground that we can do anything we want out i don't feel that it came from that
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00034.flac	everything kind of weird terrorism have started to happen you know they've got home the beaming which everyone is quite
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00035.flac	general terms yes you've gotta separate religion and state
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00036.flac	using ten with it i would have less uh culture to grow
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00037.flac	there's there's obviously a number of things from religion maybe the bullets religion is the one to look at because it has not
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00038.flac	it 's it's when you get the magic thing there's obviously something spiritual seems good open mind
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00039.flac	um my life is a bit messy but i actually i live in here
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00040.flac	see a play after that and i do one play before that and that was
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00041.flac	and but you really like the idea of people think that's great so much that you
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00002.flac	you know act of a force of nature i think i think that's what we all do need to be to get through this life to make the positive things happen in the world so uh that is the idea
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00003.flac	you say that the show which is also downloadable from the website the um it's the pre show its strip
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00004.flac	uh they in in paris they can go oh yeah scrolls up on you know they can go oh yeah that's stupid in fact in france they don't have much absurdist humor is the real humor they impose oh yes we like many not all of them die but you know the cool people do but um
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00005.flac	cooler people the people a certain amount of education they can dig real humor and it's just the references so there's no there my theory is there is no french sense of humor there is no german sense of humor
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00006.flac	i just think there is a mainstream and alternative sense of humor in every country so you want a benny hills are like a mainstream british sense of humor but he made all these references you know people slapping on heads naked people running around and people could understand that in quite a lot of countries so there you go and then there's the pipe and there's the example of more alternative humor so you just make yours
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00007.flac	to learn well you see i don't think any language is that difficult cause old russian speak russian mandarin chinese kids speak marine
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00008.flac	so you some language was really hard there should've been there should be people saying okay here as these kids just don't speak it they're just point at things now
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00009.flac	that time i think it's now i could be wrong when i get to russia cause i haven't actually i've lain i've learnt the outfit i learnt the out of it um and dylan moran has two and both me and i want to do uh russia in russia but i've got i'm good doing german next year i'm already touring france in french german next year in german in berlin two months there then i go to spain or spanish and then russia and then i'll be able to report back more accurately but i think it's the relic outfit that makes us go on
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00010.flac	i don't even know where to begin on that one um but you just have to get beyond the alphabet
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00011.flac	i can't prove this but i think it should be it's it's definitely doable it's just a matter of time you need to put into it but it's a good thing to do in this
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00012.flac	cause you know we're in financial crises around the world and whatever and it's sort of bubbling around at the moment but then the world tends to go off and become slightly more right wing and hate other people and pop turns into like races and all this kind of stuff and i'm saying now let's go the other way
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00013.flac	it was all it was going on and uh a lot of people down in london and i felt there was
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00014.flac	so i felt i should go and help there and um so i just got myself there and and started trying to help work with activists there
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00015.flac	i i think they said well we'll be in the concert live marie field and
id10273_9PmuAcGCSjY_00001.flac	my family i think it's beautiful that britain can do that you can go from there the coming in from escaping from the nes to the to their sons both being politician running for uh being
id10273_9PmuAcGCSjY_00002.flac	i was going around and someone who's going to politics in eight years um i was going
id10273_9PmuAcGCSjY_00003.flac	focus you now it's a five year parlement could well be so all the focus keeps going towards the sitting government so he doesn't get so much action in front of cameras this issue
id10273_DE9lM-s8LcA_00001.flac	i i i know nathan quite well and um i haven't seen everything he's done so it's just great i just happened to be in town for comic at the weekend and this was here so i said well yes i'll come it's great so you know great cast nathan lane
id10273_DE9lM-s8LcA_00002.flac	in films but i do when i'm doing theater i love doing it but um uh filming is my first
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00001.flac	they were oh my god they were my comedy i think i think i've stolen everything
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00002.flac	the goldfish or a thirty second memories so they don't know how long they live they they never have fear they don't have worries they can't remember their worries you know god
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00003.flac	everything is going but i just i don't think anyone in britain could believe that someone could hack a phone of someone who was the the you know
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00004.flac	why wasn't i had but now i'm quite happy not to be had unless i was at then i'm not happy to be happy
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00005.flac	show and there's one or two tickets left if you want to just be sitting in a nice because i think at the banks people are reluctant
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00006.flac	just doing it i'm doing and so uh no orchestra the orchestra has been told just just hang around guys and there's all these guys with violins
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00007.flac	the time you find as you walk up and and things and stuff that's gonna be a lot of violence is just kicking their heels
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00001.flac	it says it's just as nine and you have a big table and uh so they came down we'd say what
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00002.flac	uh that's what goes on there but i'm very positive on europe it's what humanity does we gradually come together we gradually get ferro rules for everyone so
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00003.flac	in russia and and do more in russia i really want to have russia
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00004.flac	uh homosexuality laws in the mid eighties in a democrat a company that suppose to have a democracy you know
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00005.flac	whatever we supposed to have it in the uk and so you know countries can go backwards
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00006.flac	it 's not that old canadians i just i just thought when i was in but they were saying you heard about the meat yeah they got here they said you heard about the men what
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00001.flac	which is about three hours and then i actually ejaculate uh but not uh not in a sexual way in
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00002.flac	so if you're a minority you can actually legally then
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00003.flac	people with money all these kind of things if you're working class against the the upper classes but if you're straight and and and white and male middle class it's just useless so thank god
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00004.flac	journalist back in britain uh that i was a transvestite and now and now i don't wear a dress and the people i have
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00005.flac	people do believe me that i am a transistor which is really wise i never thought when i first came out that i'd have to
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00006.flac	as they say in america they don't call that drag so i say it's not a drag for me i i'm dressing a feminine side of myself so i'm just wearing a dress i wear makeup and whatever i mean boy mode at the moment just like the human torch flame on flame off so i'm a boy on at the moment
id10273_MqKFZOAwUsg_00001.flac	seven i remember the same friends they had this amazing lego we used to wake up anyway so at seven i was a morning person after that it was how it was all down
id10273_MqKFZOAwUsg_00002.flac	well it does differently i got so used to it now i just sort of
id10273_MqKFZOAwUsg_00003.flac	that we can actually get a film career out of playing
id10273_MqKFZOAwUsg_00004.flac	because it was ted marathons and my feet started to heel um and i was runnin
id10273_MqKFZOAwUsg_00005.flac	i tried to do twenty seven americans face and last year i go back and repeat that
id10273_OYi3rZSdAOE_00001.flac	yeah of things and when they go to work they gonna say that's the testing and certain people have got it and i'll go yeah that's me i've got it and that's how it's gonna work
id10273_OYi3rZSdAOE_00002.flac	and i thought on this is that if if they were fighting back in the sixth of june if english because americans canadians british people french

id10273_OYi3rZSdAOE_00006.flac	so we're standing there talking like i got to him and then after about you know thirty seconds a minute he says
id10273_SgBON1gLfbo_00001.flac	the spit for that you know the and and honest saying can you fly and then yeah i could fly the spit or i i could i logically could because i've learned on a pipe up which is which
id10273_SgBON1gLfbo_00002.flac	but all the logic is there you know all the stuff all the basic equipment is there so i could do it
id10273_SgBON1gLfbo_00003.flac	different people would argue different countries but with a pack of one
id10273_SgBON1gLfbo_00004.flac	we go but that just hand and the arcane shot down more many planes
id10273_SgBON1gLfbo_00005.flac	if you i went to a place called mount road and it wasn't mounted
id10273_SgBON1gLfbo_00006.flac	like i'm like they did a special film about the he discovered the molecules and
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00001.flac	well i'd come out six years before so i had actually come out in eighty five and it was he was taking off in ninety one so i told friends and then i sort of
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00002.flac	and it was a bad way what a negative word so i was tim take your television it was instant
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00003.flac	and then ran and and uh so i said okay and then someone said to you
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00004.flac	you know boy was wearing a dress and i head about this and i thought and although had a kids thought it was funny but i thought now that sounds i i'd like i'd like to wear a dress um i didn't know why they couldn't work it out and i still like girls so i had the straight transgene wannabe lesbian
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00005.flac	yeah i'd say boy qualities i like lady and i never had that i never go and get drunk in the i never could get the drinks
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00006.flac	um but very focused very wanted to be special forces wanted to do paratroops
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00007.flac	and i feel having just met guys from the recently um what i've done is like sevillian special forces that's what my career has been i'm doing stuff
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00008.flac	has had and i had a fight with some other it was teenage kids they give you the how this time ago
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00009.flac	and i i give off non victim vibes i give of non victim vibe it's quite thirty years were off
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00010.flac	i know what i'm doing a um maybe not as with nivea whatever but
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00011.flac	i will stand my ground they say when your riding a high school claim the road and it's better
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00012.flac	and actually looking at people and if someone looks at me i will stand and i'm not sure
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00013.flac	train station in on tv where i used to sleep on the bench there when i was in i was about eighteen
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00014.flac	you know just living a lie because everyone's gonna lie right to be everywhere you know
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00015.flac	the other performer i was working on the stand up yes envelope
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00016.flac	he's known from being a comedy on television and they went ah yes yes he said they knew him that was an interesting so i go back and said next yes so yes he was going was going on here cause he'd had someone was gonna you know you give this guy
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00017.flac	good comedy no friend of mine so you cool with me then you gotta be cool with him and then so then it was taking sides and so they said so he said are we all cool now and they said
id10273_ZpPPaMazpf0_00018.flac	sort of and says okay we'll do a self and then the boys were not cool and all the boys
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00001.flac	in open air format because there's so many other things that people can do in a theater people are
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00002.flac	the script someone was gonna time and that was the beginning of me developing my voice and my for my own character
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00003.flac	characters are always playing characters with voices like this small data don't know i don't really want to be there so i always playing these voices like monty pathan and then i started developing my voice
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00004.flac	that took me under stand that's the front part of my standup all the back part is me doing sketches i set up a scene with myself with
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00005.flac	that's it and it locked in has never moved and that was a drama
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00006.flac	and then i couldn't get dramatic roles going and i made someone laugh when i was twelve in
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00007.flac	and then i discovered python and the guns and spike milligan peter sellers and i thought okay i will i will not do drama because i became a spotty teenager most teenagers go into this spot
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00008.flac	god if there is a god says no you'll have the worst looks that ever happened and uh so i thought i can't do i can't be a hero romantic hero and this with this going on and grain
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00009.flac	um never see her again and the you go to a boarding school you don't see dad for two thousand years so it was very
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00010.flac	difficult to survive i just close down emotionally really stop crying when i got to about eleven i realized crying was bad cause you lose arguments that way so i stop
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00011.flac	and so they decided well keep doing the job kids are
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00012.flac	that's an option so he he used to go to sleep with the radio one just to have voices happening in
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00013.flac	since then which are not standard practice otherwise everyone from boarding schools we're going do all this stuff i'm not sure i've i've got a determination genetic i think going on i've got a bloody minded in this thing i can take quite a lot of grief coming my way and push back on it i came out thirty years ago being
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00014.flac	and uh it was not cool in eighty five to say you're trans or ninety or ninety five or two thousand to two thousand and five uh or two thousand and ten two thousand fifteen i get
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00015.flac	hugely tricky because i told everyone in eighty five that i was tv and whatever and now i think we're called um and then i told my dad six years later it was just don't tell dad thing and i thought now i've got to tell dad and he was cool about it and then i told him on a saturday and on the monday i did this first
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00016.flac	uh i made one joke about being transverse and then i thought i gotta turn up in a dress and that was a few months later and i thought my career
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00017.flac	get off the ground or longer if you go back into the teenage years and i just thought this could kill it right here so it was it was
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00018.flac	true it's right it's what humanity needs to do we need to feel the fear and do it anyway you need to push back against the extremists and the hateful
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00019.flac	try and stamp and who have murdered transgender people and lesbian people and gay people for thousands of years since the dawn of time you've gotta pushed back against these disgusting people and say that we are not just in case we've been saying we this time saying actually this is genetics is in there they'll find the code at some point and i'm just a human being i have certain rights just to exist and the guilt and shame i'm not having that
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00020.flac	and they said well that's in its infancy still because there's so many millions of millions of pieces that they still haven't quite
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00021.flac	different searching around the world but at some point i predict here and now on your program they will find there they'll be lesbian will be trained to one and they won't be quite they won't be quite so boxed in they will
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00022.flac	and there's there's people who were attracted to um so asexuality's got i got a few layers in it and it's quite a complex beast but i do predict its genetic cause i've never chose this and i'm so
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00023.flac	i still have got all that side to me but there's also the girly side and i've just been honest and told
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00024.flac	like if i looked for it i could find it anywhere anytime probably yeah there was a a a young woman in brisbane who said you wearing lipstick i said yeah and said you're sick and then she walked off and then mama who happened to been judo champion of europe at fifteen she went off after her to and she was
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00025.flac	before i thirty years since i came out for for about twenty five years yes my my confidence has changed recently and i'm running for me of london in twenty twenty so i better be ready to for whatever
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00026.flac	yes but i also you know i wanted to do the things i've done if i had a kid and you try to drag him around the world or you leave them in a body school or what do you do that gets quite confusing and it's also my relationships there
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00001.flac	is uh it was we cause i i i started taking off uh without i'd already told my friends i was friends first but i hadn't told them
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00002.flac	i got nothing to with the comedy i'll just do a cereal comedy um so audiences came to see what i was wearing thin he doesn't
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00003.flac	the last one was in the next one being a duck
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00004.flac	the keystone cops but what i'd say now is that in the sixties the seventies people paid money to buy heart and soul from on the beatles the stones all those bands there
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00005.flac	um no i i'm not in the line to be james bond
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00006.flac	you know i i actually want to do action movies but they won't let me so i run forty three marathons and i'll do my own
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00007.flac	one treasure island and uh the director said you know cause i had i had a basic treasure on one has to go around on one leg with a crutch and it was a very seventeen seventeen hundreds type crutch very basic crunch i had to go around on in sand so but i had the star to do it cause i could run all the americans but it's just i i think we all desire we
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00008.flac	when i did two in two days i did think actually i could stop now and i could dine out forever years

id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00005.flac	then i went to a boarding school and didn't see my dad a lot of the time and then audiences were like a surrogate affection machine so i think that's when this lust for the love of an audience came and
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00006.flac	you know i have two hours it's quite real it's a i watch a lot of tell it i don't read a lot of books but i said no a lot of facts which i sort of weaving between do stuff on history based things and talk about the romans

id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00008.flac	and watching the sea and for four years and then i got into stand up realizing i had to understand it became the busy comedy of britain
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00009.flac	i start talking about it but not wearing any makeup or anything and so well he said tests
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00010.flac	sometimes not um and then they said this transfer everybody looks a mess looks like a small

id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00002.flac	good stuff at school seventeen and made a lot of people laughing i was about seventeen eighteen i did something that was quite dramatic but that couldn't help me at that
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00003.flac	because i've scared flight i let the fly and i found that to put the plane back down on the ground you need a confidence bordering arrogance to say this piece of
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00004.flac	singing to myself in a cold day but i was quite confident this point putting out the toss these animal
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00005.flac	which um i liked the irony of when someone came in
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00006.flac	so i can choose to do things so i try and try and get as much control as you can
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00007.flac	but you know still the majority of people are sensible but people

id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00019.flac	but humor does help in is because it makes things more light and and you can put forward our positive points and then i suppose you take

id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00002.flac	but i i do i know a hell of a lot about military history um i know a lot about well but i know now was very involved in sweden was
id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00003.flac	tribal fighting it was a part of the warrior culture and something that we grew up with
id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00004.flac	um you know it's it's obviously very boring it's it's quite contentious people disagree with it now isn't it
id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00005.flac	killing each other to know there was that the fight down in the balkans and and that was all that was a elish war but we seemed to be
id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00006.flac	you know because he didn't actually have them but you know but we used to be a huge cut plan
id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00007.flac	place on it but and i notice scandinavia that you do lots of very dark dramas now the whole world is getting to know where lots of people are dying in those dramas but not in
id10273_xadnDft3rpU_00001.flac	doing stuff on on artists and european television it was a very advanced me and my whole family who were ones

id10274_7rkVfW2yw0c_00003.flac	media but one of the reasons i'm not honest because i look at it enough already so um yeah i do
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00001.flac	a classic rock story i um when i was fourteen years old i went for
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00002.flac	audition that i wasn't sure what it was and they just i walked in and i took
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00003.flac	and uh i i had it for a couple years and it was used when i bought it and i never wrote tate the
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00004.flac	nobody knows a lot of stuff and he's a behavior of the group um so he's he's reading people and and he's not
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00005.flac	and um you know our show it's uh it's it's a big fun silly action show so you know we've had as we've gone uh now that we're in a third season we've
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00006.flac	medical problems that could happen but probably want right now we're doing a show called it's the pits
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00007.flac	couldn't happen it wouldn't happen but it's fun to watch it maybe happens
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00008.flac	growing up in new york a white castle was around it was it was against the rules in my house
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00009.flac	you know you want a classic rock story i um when i was fourteen years old i went for
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00010.flac	at that moment and i got a call that said you got it and i was like cool i don't know what it was
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00011.flac	on stage and stand with billy idol while he sang all those
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00001.flac	haven't having a great time and uh where uh the show is uht
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00002.flac	have a lot of trouble fitting in in the world have found each other and then we get hired by homeland security to find a solve all these problems and save humanity on a weekly basis which we do yours
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00003.flac	um and uh you know i i got really lucky with this that i was just having so much fun as we do like an action film
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00004.flac	it got picked up and it's been doing really well so i just have a great time doing it
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00005.flac	the show is loosely based on this guy's life and he uh he does get hired to help the government and help private companies with a lot of problems
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00006.flac	solve it but now we mess a lot of stuff up and it's a real high end
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00007.flac	and i think it's great for monday night that people really appreciate they go back to work
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00008.flac	love that movie and i got to be a part of something that made people laugh and took their minds off whatever problems
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00009.flac	one uh i found out about someone told me about that said i hear they're doing another american pot and then i was like i think i'd
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00010.flac	i was like it's not happening and then i got a call a day later that it was really happening and the way they got that together as they wrote a great script
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00011.flac	apart over this season a lot of relationships have been tested uh the show has been getting bigger and
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00001.flac	yeah i mean where i think the whole team is very worried about it um as our walter
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00002.flac	starbucks or uh for a company
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00003.flac	was this is a guy with an astronomically high iq and
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00004.flac	um so yeah you think that they'd be able to figure it out but they
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00005.flac	look we all know that you know uh the best erratic in the world has no idea what to do
id10274_YCIIiIR9B60_00001.flac	battle pressure anxiety do you know what to do start reaching out by visiting active mind stark
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00001.flac	and i never once felt the need to put it
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00002.flac	i mean you know i think i think the mets have gotten in trouble a lot over
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00003.flac	to say it was a victory because they i mean i remember sitting here with you probably a year ago
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00004.flac	and uh i was i i think i said something like i think willmar flores is gonna have an exceptional year
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00005.flac	it was a success and i think they exceed expectations um i loved watching uh them go for
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00006.flac	got which was terry's fault which was not at harvie's fault it's a job to say i gotta go out there and it's
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00007.flac	it's not at harvey who's your number one then a debate starts you know and then you gotta pick one of them they're all incredible they're all ace on any other team
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00008.flac	the world is changing twitter's changing everything so i want to see these guys go
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00009.flac	yeah it's a show for you know have a crappy monday then come home and watch us
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00010.flac	they were saying about coppa has nothing to do it but the wilpons
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00001.flac	backyard and they all pack into the tight little back yard and i think they're crowded behind an above ground pool is
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00002.flac	and so i mean i was there as a kid so that was eighty six so the met
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00003.flac	um and also when you're five years old and there's a player named
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00004.flac	because at this point we just want the number one pick right so i actually don't know how it works i mean if you have the worst record in the
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00005.flac	not so was the right move they're just it just felt like give the fans something and at that time that's all
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00006.flac	was it was the right basketball moves but um i um i'm looking for some love i'm looking for some compassion and wet
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00007.flac	um and uh it's been amazing i i really lucked out you know i was psyched to get on a tv show and then i wound up on a really fun
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00008.flac	we 're already a kind of thing cause i remember when we're doing it like oh they're doing another team movie cause i think scream had come out and i think can hardly wait
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00009.flac	and so we like it was great we're doing a movie but uh then it became
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00001.flac	uh if if it was a funny script i mean i didn't think they were gonna do a fourth one when they did the fourth one i heard about it i was on an audition and someone said to me and they're making another american pie and i was like no they're not causes
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00002.flac	so i can't play soccer at all but the weirdest thing is like anyone can put anything on
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00003.flac	going into the shower was like oh my god the show was so great everyone was really excited about it you know it's a really unique blend of comedy and action and procedural
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00004.flac	you know serialized romance stories and we were excited that we had something special but just like you said there's some
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00001.flac	i kind of had had in the earlier in my career i played a lot of like the the best
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00002.flac	the the goofy naber uh the you know so i was playing a lot of characters were kind of along the same lines as joey from friends and i i was trying to make a transition into more leading man character uh type roles and um and so i i was going through
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00003.flac	of of uh a dry spell in my career and i hadn't worked for
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00004.flac	it took a little while for me to convince the the business that um i i could play something other than what i had been playing so when i when i walked into the test at warehouse thirteen
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00005.flac	i needed a job i wanted a job i had just had the my second baby my second son had just been born like two weeks before that and um you know i was i was staring the reality of not having a job or any money you know squarely in the face so um
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00006.flac	there 's two of each character when we walked in there was like seven or eight seven or eight my guys and seven or eight
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00007.flac	you just kinda go oh they have no idea what they want were just the number here and my chance of getting this job
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00008.flac	mice and the peace and going back and forth and going back and forth and um and kind of was
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00009.flac	it seemed to me that you could kinda tell least i could tell who was who they were paying attention to and then the guy that went in right before me the director came out
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00010.flac	come here and he put his he put his arm around this guy and he walked down the hall with this guy and i was like
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00011.flac	with the regurgitated worm and and give up the worm and i and i got no worm man i've gotten
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00012.flac	worm to give and i was actually saying that out
id10275_HK20g60KlTI_00001.flac	unnatural it's it's probably the worst part of being an actor other than not being able
id10275_HK20g60KlTI_00002.flac	a cheer and i'm like oh no no that's okay but then he goes hey crag there's a over here it looks just like you and so the sheer
id10275_HK20g60KlTI_00003.flac	somebody will look like me someday cause i got this new show
id10275_ICEJz3WX2n0_00001.flac	i normally look guys wear overalls apparently like the
id10275_ICEJz3WX2n0_00002.flac	and into your pants pockets so there's no real pockets in the
id10275_JbpXWB1V8cA_00001.flac	and who wants to who wants to hang around for waiting for you
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00001.flac	uh the the show every week is kind of a mini movie um it's not too serialized so if you miss an episode you won't get completely lost
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00002.flac	and and uh what's for me what's great about the show is i have a couple of
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00003.flac	voice and um the show doesn't talk down to them
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00004.flac	in the adults can both watch at the same time and both find something that interests them and something that they can relate to you know it reminds me of it reminds me of the old days when that used to have the walt disney on sunday night the disney movies online
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00005.flac	a whole family would sit around and watch it like you know when kurt russell did the world's strongest man stuff like that
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00006.flac	it's it's we don't take ourselves too seriously but at the same time there's some great drama it's a it's our exec producer calls it a thriller made
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00007.flac	and uh and that's why i think people should wash it cause i i think everybody can relate to it
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00008.flac	the artifacts in the warehouse are really just plot devices to get us to what the really show is at it
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00009.flac	and fifty percent uh female worship
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00001.flac	time high guys um yeah i mean any time someone has enough interest to fly you across the option and uh come to to meet the fans of warehouse thirteen i say i'm doing something right so yeah i'm having
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00002.flac	um i've been to australia i've been here uh to the times uh to them
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00003.flac	u 've gone over to paris the times do not uh not uh icons but to do press and um so i've been around you know
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00004.flac	well uh there's a there's a con called dragon con in atlanta where there's
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00005.flac	five or six hours with no with bundles chaps on so any time you can see in here with bundles chaps i say that's a good time right
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00006.flac	caps here but if there had been some i would have had
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00007.flac	uh you know we kind of always roll our eyes at what's your favorite artifact or what's your favorite
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00008.flac	uh no i don't mind uh uh my favorite artifact is uh abraham lincoln's hat because i put it on and had an irresistible urge to free miss fredrick so that that was pretty
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00009.flac	uh i thought that was a really a just a good episode for the show um if you remember it's part of the two part finale from season three uh we're
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00010.flac	it made me feel a lot of pride for the shows
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00011.flac	i mean the reason i like the show um is that uh it has
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00012.flac	you know it has action ashore has
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00013.flac	it has um romance i mean it's it's all it's all the jones kind of wrapped up into one
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00014.flac	the kids can watch it to you know it doesn't it doesn't talk down to kids but but still the adults can watch it
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00015.flac	you know it's been sober for thirteen years i've also i'm also over thirteen years that's that's a good one i love comic books
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00016.flac	i was never a marine i was never a marine but i but i have a great deal of respect for anybody who
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00017.flac	but uh but yeah i think there's there's a ton of of myself in that
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00018.flac	i don't know a loose cannon that was supposed to be there but uh the funny stuff
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00019.flac	uh you know he's he's one of the funniest i mean he's one of the funniest smartest guys on the planet that i've ever met so i think the success of the show is
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00020.flac	um because of him and because of his willingness to let him do what he wants to do on the show
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00021.flac	and uh i'm actually kind of in production with george romero um we just finished a a script that we're there we're trying to get made for a new dead movie called wrote the
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00022.flac	um it's basically about um humans have now exploited zombies because that's what we do as humans we are
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00023.flac	we exploit everything and uh we've taken the zombies and we used them for our our own entertainment we taught them to drive in kind of aum death race where we we watched them are reduced

id10275_pV6cJibX6Ik_00003.flac	people come here they save their money they spend their money because they want to spend money on the things
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00001.flac	just be a guy and as a normal guy it's like when i when i
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00002.flac	for the initial audition i i just played it as myself because if i got the job i just have to go to work and be myself
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00003.flac	one of them being that that everybody can watch the show it's not just
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00004.flac	but uh yeah i mean i like i like
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00005.flac	coups and roses and there but but uh we we certainly love each other and
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00001.flac	um no the question that comes up as people say are you gonna do a second trilogy and i like oh i just finish this
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00002.flac	we i think we do really well actually and actually you know this script was the first time we'd written together for quite a few years i think sort of
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00003.flac	i just try to think i guess it was pretty to five years since we had written hotels when we had the story idea on the hot press in two thousand seven
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00004.flac	it was it was sidney was gonna be landing from wellington sidney and i had the idea on the plane and i was thinking about the script that i had written when i was twenty one about teenagers on a pc which i'd never done anything with and i didn't necessarily wanna make that film now but i thought well maybe there's something in the big ads and
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00005.flac	uh you know there's richard potential in the in in the themes that mean simon keep coming back to it about perpetually had a lesson what if like there's one guy that really wants to do this again and the other four aren't that
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00006.flac	you know forcibly regress them a hell so i mentioned the idea to simon and then we immediately kind of like sort of started hashing out the story
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00007.flac	but then when we came to write it like years later i like it was it was good we both had a break we both done a lot of other projects and it just came out very sort of fluidly because we'd had a lot of time to think
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00008.flac	in the memory i didn't need any more hang over the stuff but i i uh i yeah i do one when i was nineteen which is where the original script came from which i was a disaster and then in my late twenties to mid twenties maybe after space time before shown me and simon and nick ended up in my hometown and we tried to do it again and that won't even worse
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00009.flac	so i think sort of then then it starts to really strike me that this was like
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00010.flac	uh a pathetic sort of like attempt to recapture teenage
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00011.flac	they came from really and then the sort of the the idea of the blue kinda inside as cause when i was a kid
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00012.flac	reminded me of school so i wanted to make the actors all feel that they were back at school again in the hands with
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00013.flac	i didn't even tell empire in london i sort of the is the thing is i get very superstitious about like sort of talking about things before they're done cause it
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00014.flac	be the wolf and um you know talk about something if it doesn't you know i mean it will happen but it i feel very
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00001.flac	dressing you know based on the fact that the character is like grown up through this kind of pop culture and that he is like living is
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00002.flac	big day dream is to see the film is like a big day dream is that's got pilgrims like
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00003.flac	character who's in this kind of um you know sort of perpetual adolescence and hasn't really grown up and uh he's living his life through the media that he consumes and and what the film is about the end of century is about him kind of growing
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00004.flac	so i go into that too much is like so it's it's uh it's also something i haven't worked on that for two years i worked on this film solidly for two years so the last time actually did any work on
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00005.flac	eight weeks before i started in scott pilgrim and i wasn't around in the heat which was an enormous bama because i basically worked on a film with even a pic jackson and then i wasn't actually around to be on the set at all
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00006.flac	the boat like to actually watch that in in in action but in the case of that one i didn't try and grab my own personality and we just tried to be true to her
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00001.flac	think you have to watch anything before the new one um i would have all three movies a stand alone
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00002.flac	brian for the wives and uh very brian for nineteen seventy five
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00003.flac	i like to think that me and simon and nick would work together again i mean
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00004.flac	it was six years in and um you know we really um
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00005.flac	sort of moved everything else away so that we can make this wanting and um before it's too late so i'm really really
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00006.flac	he does this incredible vocal warmups just before i take which is something to witness it's quite
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00007.flac	i don't know i am i actually there's quite a few things i have not seen
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00008.flac	books comics films games there's a certain part of me that kind of felt like i sort of
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00009.flac	king might win because i'm not sure that he'd fight entirely fair maybe nick
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00010.flac	this is amazing and binds ending it's great and uh i don't think they really
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00011.flac	we always knew it was gonna be something slightly different and brian actually was involved in writing the final scene we actually
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00012.flac	very involved in it and he was very happy with the idea that he would diverge
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00013.flac	i think because scott pilgrim like touched on a number of genres like action comedy romance
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00014.flac	like action it was always gonna be a slightly harder sell and i think you know
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00015.flac	i think it wasn't because it wasn't completely generic like sometimes people just alike
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00016.flac	have no idea what that is so i think it's just down to sort of if you're trying to do something different you just gotta work twice as hard
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00017.flac	and it was a tough film to kind of like to explain i think that's the
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00018.flac	but that on the flipside of it like i was very pro the movie
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00019.flac	whenever and um but we all very proud of this show
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00020.flac	and we just had sort of faith in it and then it eventually found its audience on tv so i sort of when when i went through the same thing in scott pilgrim i i i just sort of have faith in what i'd made and then it would get out there and i fell
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00021.flac	films a massive massive hits kind of like do the month the cinema and then never gets seen on the big screen ever again i'll never never ever want
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00022.flac	the average and what's really nice is the pilgrim like somewhere in the world is playing like
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00023.flac	you know like the prince charles so all the time and like the new beverly in los angeles and i like that i think that that makes me very happy that people are still saying it with the crowd you know and also that it's
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00024.flac	i think so of like i think i already got all of that and my sister in scotland i feel that and it's more controversy to say maybe dunkin journeys with water water demand to be but there has never been a great game film and i think that so far and the reason for that is is it's just like umbrellas
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00025.flac	staring you in the face is that a video game is like sort of a unique experience to you you are playing the game and just like watching somebody
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00026.flac	my answer is there is no game that i would work with that maybe rampant
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00027.flac	being so impassioned about like or what
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00028.flac	chris nolan backman is very different to tim burns backman which is a very different to adam west back man and there's a room for all three
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00001.flac	no i don't really read too much of the stuff that gets on my way
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00002.flac	but for some reason i read this one and i could see straight away why they'd given it to me actually i think i read the first book i hadn't come out he actually thinking about that
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00003.flac	he was just a show of the dead and um and just reading it if anything she reminded me a bit of space
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00004.flac	you know so it was the chance to hot fusion the dead even though they have really ridiculous things in them they both take place in a real world where like people dying to come back and
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00005.flac	it was interesting to me because it's both highly relatable like it takes place
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00006.flac	and you know it's essentially about a bunch of people in their teens and early twenty
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00007.flac	but it uh it's a sort of like magical feel to it in the world where anything
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00008.flac	i think it was pretty instinctive i don't know what a straight a version of scott pilgrim is to the world would be people sort of have asked me um like um you know how far is too far and i was thinking i don't really know i had a soft pedal film like this i think it's especially when you read the source material and you know what it's about and the tone of it it just it felt like it was
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00009.flac	you know a licence to let my imagination run right a little bit and i think that's what's kind of like that's fun and fresh about it like i'm so
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00010.flac	when people have asked me that i kind of ponder thinking i don't know what a strait version of scotland would be the whole the whole kind of the the whole
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00011.flac	raising of the whole piece is the you're essentially seeing the film that's playing is got piles head and scope as a character in his early twenties who has grown up on a morning
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00012.flac	comic books and video games and probably too much sugar product and you're watching a kind of like how he would like to live
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00013.flac	yeah no i mean i definitely was a kid at school i i when i was at school a comprehensive i was short site i didn't know i was short still i was twenty and as such i would frequently look to the window like it in classes because i couldn't see the black ball probably and
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00014.flac	and doing kind of like rock band not unlike sex bomb on my schoolbook even like the look of sex when they're playing and they have kind of lightning bolts and jake lines coming out you know i would describe it to the animates i said it should look like a fourteen year old idea of a rock band um and sometimes
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00015.flac	you know a scope as a character was twenty two but sometimes he he like a twelve year old and i can definitely empathize with him
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00016.flac	was around so the scope of is an interesting character is like he's he's quite a flared hero you get the feeling that he kind of
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00017.flac	he would get distracted by a sort of art as much as he would next kind of gorgeous girl that walks
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00018.flac	no it was a it was a pretty organic process i mean we had a structure worked out as far back as two thousand
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00019.flac	new materials it kinda came together brian when we first started we had three books and
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00020.flac	books and then kept developing ripe or shooting so even in the sixth book we knew how it was gonna end and then we even
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00021.flac	you know the reflected like some of the final sort of passages of book six so it's been a good organic process there were times that we watch in ten there were times when brian took some lines out of the screen and put them in the books which was very sort of pleasing you know so there's a couple of lines in volume four and five that come from our screen play
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00001.flac	really like what we did like the world and is a is a real pub name in fact there is like several in the uk there's one in particular that mean simon
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00002.flac	at the world and i'll meet you at the world and so on he wrote
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00003.flac	to illustrate what was happening in each one so we wanted them to feel like terror it's like the name of tells you
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00004.flac	it's like film is a visual medium if you know if you like looking at the ground will be at the theater
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00005.flac	i literally represent kind of like that identity is like this to like
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00006.flac	absolutely like i think sort of with this it was definitely like to because it was a combination of like son of the films we want
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00007.flac	you know my my script didn't like feature that also like it wasn't like it is not a problem for me you know like us
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00001.flac	you would want the audience to see it as the journey which is cold so why would you wanna spoil
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00002.flac	i think it's like no i think it's just it's pretty obvious is that you want people to see it
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00004.flac	like sort of juan antic so it was a sort of a film about regression and about the perils of lighting a star and like how it's dangerous to go backwards and like how you can never go home again so we thought like you know we both meaning a film like small towns and came to london so whenever we go back as a strange and sometimes it sweet experience and we thought that was a great kind of like to play for a fire
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00005.flac	absolutely no i would never rule anything out it's definitely um i i don't i don't know why people would think it was a good buy to to the u s you know i had a blast making this woman it was
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00006.flac	cause i haven't really started on it so i don't have a lot to discuss
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00001.flac	and even to the point where there's the big kind of sonic face off between two buns
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00002.flac	i like the summer of two thousand eight am i asked god to get involved in the film
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00003.flac	it 's the first scores ever done but prior to that way before like eighteen months before we start to get the artist together to portray the different banks
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00004.flac	a song in the film why doesn't dan do that and so he did the number cornelius who i'm a huge fan of
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00005.flac	his playing was designed in the tanks to be a lot shorter the test was really sure and then we actually expanded there
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00006.flac	the theme song changed uh one of the songs was gonna be on the credit just said oh you can't think that some incredibly that should be the one
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00007.flac	you're shooting i think this is great you know we should so it went far away from the original idea of hearing or not hearing the
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00008.flac	it feels in that respect you know does start to feel like a more like a seventies film life
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00001.flac	this one it was something where one like like a lot of five movies is that they came out of like a manifestation of of the fear in a way and the movie is about um people returning to that hometown and realizing the time has marched on without them and simon's character is a man who's forty who wants to be eighteen again so like the kind of the theater
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00002.flac	the aliens in the movie essentially represent the kind of that fear of change and that loss of identity so this all of the things came together it's actually like literally like when i was like um in my mid twenties when i sort of used to go back to my hometown very like kind of like holidays like
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00003.flac	i would uh like sort of you know get increasingly kinda like sort of amused by the fact like oh like nobody remembers me like another the bartenders remember me the school bully doesn't remember me it's like it's not so much that i never left it's like i was never here and i remember saying to a friend of mine like way i said well every time i go back to my hometown it feels like invention of the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00004.flac	so like little ideas like that like stick is like okay and i can never go home again you feel
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00005.flac	a bigger reason and in the movie like sort of like so all of these things sort of came together it's like we wanted to do a movie about kind of like
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00006.flac	the dangers of nature and like a man trying to turn back the clock and you know but then even just the thing of like a homecoming is that sort of like
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00007.flac	if it is as much a coping strategy for me and simon is for gary king is that like he's almost there's a scene in the movie where he finds out that like something's afoot and he's happy when he's talking
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00008.flac	he can accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older like
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00009.flac	he's not as bigger legend as he thinks he is and the town wasn't all it was cracked out to be anyway so i think in this particular case it was something like this is the story which is like sort of like the fire is
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00010.flac	something's afoot and he's happy when he's talking about him and the reason he's happy is he's
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00011.flac	he can accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older like them
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00012.flac	he's not as big legend as he thinks he is and the tone wasn't all it was cracked up to be anyway so i think in this particular case it was something like this is the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00013.flac	because it's like a star stuff we draw a very sharp line in the sand at the end
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00014.flac	with the drunk humor you only have one shot there is no real ground you know so but then like the what the movie is about like his is the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00015.flac	you know like our hero like simon's character and is extremely flawed and is like makes a lot of bad decisions and do some terrible things you know like and he's very questionable like in his uh motives a lot of the time and yet when it comes down to it is that what makes us human is like the fact that we are flawed and make mistakes the key is can you learn from your mistakes so we wanted to make something which like sort of like um you know it has this kind of like big sort of philosophical scifi climax but with drunk people
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00016.flac	plans other than that we'd like to work together and like i think the thing is like sort of like and we're very proud that we did this third movie and um as much as fans wanted us to do another one we wanted to do another one you know but the other thing is that the sort of that maybe fans i don't know is how hard it is to get these movies made so like you know if if you want us to do another film
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00017.flac	specific criteria for these movies is that they're all like genre films that really like trojan horses for the relationship movies
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00018.flac	like they're all about like perpetual adolescence uh lots of identity the individuals in the collective they're all about growing up
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00019.flac	those themes so i think that means if we did another film together we might do something
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00020.flac	all three of the movies that fast short and this one they all have endings that like
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00001.flac	film i like the film so base film for which is at
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00002.flac	and uh and it's really spooky it's kind of like a mix
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00003.flac	superman is just a really spooky film good performance is really great photography i watched it on tv when i was a little kid and then it's finally come back
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00004.flac	a spanish director who only did one of the film which is also
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00005.flac	but it's about um a couple that go to a spanish island where kids have taken over the kids don't say anything and it's kinda like it's like the birds with little kids and it's particularly like grim and spoke
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00006.flac	it was also known in the seventies as ireland of the damned and uh both filmed by that direct it's both great
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00007.flac	that 's really worth watching um it's by the same team that did
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00008.flac	charity event in this village which then it's taken over by terrorists so the olympic
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00009.flac	is so much fun born to fight i highly recommend it i've been trying to get hold of a print of it cause i want to show it to the audience cause i've watched tv and it's just
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00010.flac	obscure but it was for quite awhile quite difficult to get hold of is targets for flies on gravel which is
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00011.flac	um and then the title itself i probably shouldn't tell you what the title refers to you cause it kinda gives away the
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00012.flac	like a great warm up to that basically so that's a little bit more a little
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00013.flac	in preparation for a hot is called live like a cop d like a man
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00014.flac	and then there's this acoustic duo who is singing a sort of sappy
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00015.flac	this kind of um hippy was like and it's one of those films it has like it has a big dance numbers in it it's got sort of quite a big budget like amazing desire design the choreography
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00016.flac	and then years later i ran into him in and he remembered me and said he has it going you watching your films and said you didn't tell me about the apple
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00017.flac	i wanted all about the apple that's definitely where watching it has an amazing ending where it looks like they run out of money or something happened where just as it's getting to what should be its third act the film abruptly stops with an intervention by god literally like in one scene one of the characters says mr tops is coming and stop turns out to be
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00018.flac	you watch you kind of think this is so cool this is like a sort of an of extremes
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00019.flac	deserves the prank so i i would say like some people who watch it say oh this film is so cool and yet some amazingly funny bits in it it definitely can get it on tv i'm not ever saw it that so the festival is its case with and it's um it's
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00020.flac	i would i would i would recommend it i would necessarily condone it i would never make the movie
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00021.flac	like his french point blank um which i presume is called something else in france
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00022.flac	you can get it on a bum and sort but
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00023.flac	and basically they all die horribly and when each one dies
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00024.flac	as i'd always sort of i didn't know what the title of it was i missed the title and then much later i found it was called patches and it was rated by jim mackenzie and it's on um uh a bead called like stop looking listen one of those
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00025.flac	is a little known nineteen ninety five film called for the fingers it was directed by howard write uh he was twenty two
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00026.flac	you might look out for a young fresh faced twenty year old actor who appears in one scene before briefly getting shot it also features a rebel a true jean vile is in the movie
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00027.flac	uh i believe the director had to make it like i'm pat it out to get to seventy eight minutes
id10276_P91fRfZ0PEE_00001.flac	one thank you for not asking any question and now it's true i am developing a horror movie it's funny cause people always asked me if i'm ever gonna do a film of don't and i wouldn't because i think you've already seen the funniest version of that and i wanna do a straight horror movie and i have this idea for like i guess it's like doing a luck an english ale the movie i really like this kind of dreamy like
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00001.flac	right and this is a hastily written list of my favorite films of two thousand thirteen but with this clamor because it's the twenty six november and there are a lot of awards films that come out in the last couple of months of the year that i have not yet seen so this does not include the following films because it
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00002.flac	a great film short term twelve with brian who
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00003.flac	dean's blue jasmin i saw that twice and hands
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00004.flac	favorite film of the year another film that's quite divisive but i loved it is harmony in the spring breakers which is
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00005.flac	from the year which i've seen twice on the big screen and would plant a third time be fans gravity which i think is extraordinary and i recommend
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00001.flac	i think it either it was like sort of cause it actually was very pleased with the ends out but it was this
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00002.flac	you know how do we doing twelve weeks with all the fight scenes and i said well you know the the tradeoff is that to get to shoot like um
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00003.flac	gonna happen and and we we and we then we tried once we had at the scene was we tried to
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00004.flac	and um i was siting on the plane and i had uh i think it was around the time that a super bad was about to come out and i was thinking about that film and hands
id10276_XunbBdgkGwU_00001.flac	um i see myself in carrying a little bit as well and i sort of i think sort of like the you gotta have sympathy for your characters because even though the character like this place is like a sort of walking carcass of a man you know he still like he hits rock bottom but he still kind of rises up to be a hero that's important is that you've got to kind of like um we we don't write characters that we don't have
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00001.flac	two weeks ago so it still feels pretty fresh fresh to me so like
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00002.flac	it 's always funny when people watch a film and they say so what's next i said what don't you just watch them
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00003.flac	i mean literally just finished it like at least at least hold episode like about three or four
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00004.flac	so um i i feel i feel i feel very nice in terms of
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00005.flac	this film that made me quite kind of like emotional just watching them in a way because
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00006.flac	you know i think in a similar way to show it gets kind of as well as it being like funny in action pact it gets kind of a bit deeper emotionally sometimes
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00007.flac	friends who have a rift and i think a lot of people have that experience of like sort of the people that you thought when you were nineteen you were gonna be best friends with forever maybe you're not as close anymore and it's really a film
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00008.flac	well the the theme and a stage in the movie is obviously very strong it's almost like it's gary's worst enemy if anything the the villain of the piece in the movie is star because like simon's character gary
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00009.flac	is convinced that he wants to relive his nineteen ninety glory days and it's that thing of that you should be careful what you wish for because when they they do attempt to recreate it things go badly wrong and also
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00010.flac	you know what the film is about is that sort of the the difference between uh your kind of like rose tinted like sort of memory of the past and the reality of it and so and then once you add all into the mix it comes like this kind of like time machines sending you back to being teenagers again so it's definitely the whole film is like a bit of a
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00011.flac	in terms of like the other actors in it it was definitely important to us that it wasn't so much about well this a couple of things you write about space is that the one person from space you hadn't been in
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00012.flac	we had written a role for him in the dead which then got cut out he didn't shoot it we just cut out of the scripts whole us was
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00013.flac	um and then we also make sure that the people who were in the first two movies at one end to like her and she would also be in this one so that's it
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00014.flac	i think it's because i i i grew up in a small town in england you know like well in case where i grew up is very
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00015.flac	so as a result i feel like sort of like most of the films i've made have some larger form of escapism in this space is no different about like here's my
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00016.flac	and and this is different in a way in terms of it's actually sort of like you know with the start of the movie
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00017.flac	knight as being like the sort of the most action at night ever and then the irony is when he tries to recreate it it really
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00018.flac	it really comes changing when it comes into marketing and stuff because i think if you had to cut together a trailer that said it was just about friends drinking in the pub then i think a twenty th of the audience
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00019.flac	so you have to at least hint that there's gonna be some kind of like sort of you know like big scale kind of action and special effects so there's lots of there's lots of things that aren't in the trailer that we have kind of kept to ourselves but you know you've got enough action and special effects into the trailer so people will
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00001.flac	sort of said i was there anything you had to cut out of thin well not really i think we went we went for it in my main thing definitely though what i mean is the
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00002.flac	you know it makes it very kind of like uh challenging to kind of try and make
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00003.flac	as it is so i i i i kinda feel like that as a film or sometimes i watch some summer films which you hear about that cost like two hundred million and you watch it and where did i go what do they spend it all on that one
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00004.flac	or something and so you know like with this film i just thinking i started to make sure
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00005.flac	like some people it's the same way that some girls don't like being called cute is like oh you're really using how do like that word is the same way that some guys saying oh you're so nice it's like sort of like i wanna be nice some wanna be like i wanna be
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00001.flac	some of that stuff is the wetter boys we we we we kind of um we were kind of hard trying
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00002.flac	make the plot and the characters work so some of the kind of snowy stuff and some of the references like say the kind of you know the crab with
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00003.flac	i was wondering if they had opened but um when that a lot of that stuff is the is the the wizard the water kind of putting in references into the corner every frame i guess the sort of if there's a favorite one i think her drawing the portrait the stars
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00004.flac	there was a thing that like john he would be a good calculus but then somebody point out that john hurt place oculus in the
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00005.flac	uh maybe is like a pantomime thompson like a big one of the thompsons that have like a man next to me as another
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00001.flac	where man now one direction of the biggest they're gonna go down to the earth and take over
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00002.flac	it stars and the aliens all bow down and then you just have to pretend to be harry
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00003.flac	i would be stuck on that line in there and i would know that particular issue
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00004.flac	it would mean nothing anymore because i'd just be on that lion that be like my little kind of like a little um sort of safe haven that's gonna last for like two and then i will give myself up to the one i'd be so like um hungry
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00001.flac	it has mostly comedic actors and then the rest of the village of sanford played by real
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00002.flac	living legends and uh proper like this so that was fun to do and it was you know to have those people in a big
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00003.flac	humble and to be playing often with different actors from different
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00004.flac	you know we haven't really got the the budget to kind of like both things
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00001.flac	who was running empty at the time came back i just come back from
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00002.flac	the scheduling and i got a rumor
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00003.flac	do i hear stories were in trouble
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00004.flac	i was just there and i thought we were in trouble i would have stayed there and fought for the
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00005.flac	been canceled had i not been for the controversy that arose over my uh stand on
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00006.flac	to be taken down to a salvadoran
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00007.flac	uh with uh uh drugs and medicines for the people in the hills who weren't getting it the composter
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00008.flac	um it was also to call attention to salvador by this by this act which is why we gathered and washington
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00009.flac	as with the strike became the because i had the viable show on tv i became
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00010.flac	delivered the speech of hh of announcement for them
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00011.flac	said uh can you say you're in favor of free elections in elevator what if that election turns out a community
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00012.flac	i went on to answer another question and all the time in my brain i'm saying uh uh have i come this far
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00013.flac	so i turned back to that guy again after i answered the next question i said i wasn't satisfied with my answer what i would want to say is
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00014.flac	so i turned back to that guy again after i answered the next question i said i wasn't satisfied with my answer what i would want to say is
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00015.flac	a lot of controversy arose up a couple of congressmen and lead a boycott on grants
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00016.flac	i had the newspaper in greensboro pense vania and he wrote the editorial in any other country edward to be taken out and shot
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00017.flac	but thank god this is an american so and so on and you felt the regret that this wasn't any other country for him
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00018.flac	sent me a letter showing what they had done that called in to say that they
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00019.flac	kimberly clark saying that they wanted to express their appreciation at their sponsorship of the show and they would continue to
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00020.flac	grant were pleased proud to inform you that we will no longer be
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00021.flac	so two out of three were rich this is at the point where
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00022.flac	one producer said uh we think there are two ways of doing things the way the show doesn't in the way you're doing it we think our way
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00023.flac	at me primarily by charlton heston among many others and i would answer either surgically or honestly and or
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00024.flac	but it it it seemed to require response silence not seen
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00025.flac	of course i had i been more sophisticated realized it would now lead to another response and i would refer their initial attack
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00026.flac	the the guild voted to support vines redgrave also against the boston
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00027.flac	was requested formally to support her in this effort
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00028.flac	and i as president of the gilt voted for it as well but i wanted to make an example of me
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00029.flac	second sunday about thirty or forty of them shot my wife and kids are appearing
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00030.flac	and there and it's a small hillside street rosemary
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00031.flac	people are driving up and they're taking up a lot of the street and the coating
id10278_LVXvQzNatXI_00001.flac	i probably be more grand you know show take make it less inward nowell well worked
id10278_LVXvQzNatXI_00002.flac	i stabbed her good with that
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00001.flac	talk about nine eleven for the rest of the afternoon i'll be glad to
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00002.flac	organization called two thousand architects and engineers on nine eleven who
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00003.flac	the this story of how it happened or how it could have
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00004.flac	people people wish to be bobbleheads they wish to
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00005.flac	do this or allow this to be done to itself or
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00006.flac	so that takes care of at least a majority
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00007.flac	i don't know i don't know but i think too for people to ask that
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00008.flac	uh to bring the liberals out in force but the fact uh perhaps they
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00009.flac	all of the information that uh he talked about the uh the evils of
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00010.flac	and the purity of the rebel movement uh maybe they choose to believe that make it simple five for them
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00011.flac	i am sure there is a segment of the anti war movement
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00012.flac	less bellicose party the democrats all it's hard to tell the difference
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00013.flac	i am i'm not pleased with the president's performance with her without
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00014.flac	hollywood actors are at least putting out some semblance of beauty or a style
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00015.flac	unfair to listen as as part of the one percent
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00016.flac	would be much better spent on the corporations who get away with not paying taxes on the corporations and individuals who get away with
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00017.flac	i don't think there are that many hollywood actors who are stealing money these days it's been a somewhat
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00018.flac	to up to us all kinds of american products we uh we have been
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00019.flac	different i would love to see the fact that uh most people
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00020.flac	could understand what socialism means and wonder how it benefits the individual and how there are very socialist practices at work in this country even though we're corporatocracy but i would like to see it advanced even more so that are people i mean to to read in the paper however
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00021.flac	in congress vote against food stamps and at the same time take millions of us
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00022.flac	from the government for the agricultural farms
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00023.flac	if if the exposure would be a widespread i mean who is this guy the guy from tennis i believe i can't remember his name three point two million dollars he got for the government last year and he voted against food stamps and most of those republicans and most of them are
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00024.flac	fall into his corporate agenda that's the other thing i wanted to point out
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00025.flac	so called anti war liberals in hollywood who haven't spoken up i think they read the figures and they see that the last majority of the american people are against another war yet another war and they were stung at their treatment uh with george bush in a rack so they uh they they felt that it was not an urgent case for them to rush forward on this one with the majority of the american people are
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00026.flac	the thing that we have finally reached a point in this country where enough people are educated enough people are
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00027.flac	looking a witness enough to history to see that well
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00028.flac	our jesup another war to to
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00029.flac	kickstart the economy we have done it too many times the noma
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00030.flac	there was even some talk about career granada was a bunch of
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00031.flac	and it's i think it it serves our country wonderfully well not to
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00032.flac	if we're going to if we're going to fix the world let's do it with bandages
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00033.flac	and my son has a son who is artistic so we are directly affected
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00034.flac	we wish to call the attention of this
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00035.flac	called people's attention to it make people aware of it realize it
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00036.flac	some say it's environment some say some have tried to say that
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00037.flac	and it falls in within a spectrum but has commanded more and more attention as
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00001.flac	the the shows were the the funniest shows i had scene since i'd been in california the best
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00002.flac	and i i was enormously blot
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00003.flac	when will we have had a chance to do such a wonderful character and such a wonderful
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00004.flac	plenty of time that with the resources given to him
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00005.flac	he should be expected to have ted baxter as his newsman and
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00006.flac	her mary to totally
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00007.flac	i suppose so i don't know where one stop
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00008.flac	uh he still was more idealistic and more sales
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00009.flac	in the seven years of of of le grand i would say that i used a lot of
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00010.flac	my brothers their devilish aspect
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00011.flac	but when i got into a somber legrand of lu
id10278_QiMd9_dc-M4_00001.flac	uh i also felt that they would i wanted to do it not because i really wanted to do that character but
id10278_QiMd9_dc-M4_00002.flac	to think that they wouldn't get enough wide actors to support them in this venture
id10278_QiMd9_dc-M4_00003.flac	whether it was the fact of impending failure that made free silver
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00001.flac	and there were two shows left and i had a vacation
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00002.flac	rehearsing and all of the jokes are about death
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00003.flac	and they were not chuckling too loudly at this particular show very worried abou
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00004.flac	and there were two shows left and i had a vacation
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00005.flac	rehearsing and all of the jokes are about death and
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00006.flac	and they were not chuckling too loudly at this particular show very worried about
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00007.flac	where about it's either five or six minutes short
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00008.flac	you know this show is so nicely tightly written david loyd wrote it
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00009.flac	because we believed in the perfect roundness of the show
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00010.flac	the first scene gavin comes in and start spouting the niners about chuckles you know born on a trunk
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00011.flac	that the audience came in on the laughs and participated in the fun fest well that one
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00012.flac	from the audience by the time we finished the show we had gotten

id10278_d6WJf6TOoIQ_00002.flac	reading which is a euphemism for saying it so as far as
id10278_d6WJf6TOoIQ_00003.flac	i i realize that so they say when we have you back which
id10278_d6WJf6TOoIQ_00004.flac	all out with mary and i thought crazy wig wild wall

id10278_d6WJf6TOoIQ_00006.flac	took us two years to realize how to do it right we had good shows in the meantime we want is
id10278_d6WJf6TOoIQ_00007.flac	going from uh a hundred and eighty degrees difference and nobody producers writers crew nobody knew what it was like to try to take a half hour comedy show with three cameras and make it a one hour drama with
id10278_d6WJf6TOoIQ_00008.flac	adulterated even uh we were all very happy we had
id10278_fvX1Vtx3sNo_00001.flac	public opinion turned against this government for keeping the government and power who sponsor death squads going
id10278_fvX1Vtx3sNo_00002.flac	turning you know what they actually do is turn the present into coyness
id10278_fvX1Vtx3sNo_00003.flac	and yet they they they accept the fact that it's justified that we're there we're losing
id10278_fvX1Vtx3sNo_00004.flac	you know i i've paid the price already my show
id10278_fvX1Vtx3sNo_00005.flac	but my my guts won't let me keep my mouth shut
id10278_fvX1Vtx3sNo_00006.flac	you know i i've paid the price already my show
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00001.flac	looking for a show to come back with now that raman berg

id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00003.flac	funny stuff to do and i turned him into a funny comedic police
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00004.flac	he had already acquired uh jim brooks and allen burns to prepare the pilot for america
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00005.flac	uh they didn't know my work but uh they then turned and asked the man u it can use
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00006.flac	beautifully and eternally gratefully for me said she can do anything so they sought me out and i read
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00007.flac	and uh i avoided comedy because i always wore how would i repeat them
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00008.flac	so i read for them and when i finished jim brooks said well that was a very
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00009.flac	well when we have you back to read with mary we want you to read way crazy all stops out and didn't know what they are
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00010.flac	why don't you have me read it that way now and if i don't pull it off don't have me back no i've never made such minds
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00011.flac	statements such as that in my life i was i've always called in for jobs and generally called
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00012.flac	um i said well we do have another appointment but uh
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00013.flac	they laugh like hell they said we did just like that when you come back to read with mary
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00014.flac	just trying to remember all of the noddy things i did and i wanted to repeat
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00015.flac	four years later when i left mary turned to them and said a huge
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00016.flac	and they got enough to satisfy themselves they they had a number of people have close in to see them just before
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00017.flac	four years later when i left mary turned to them and said a house
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00018.flac	and the response was that your lot so i wanted i guess they wanted to see how much of a jerk i was willing to make my
id10278_pJsgUla1_1I_00001.flac	i'm delighted to appear on again after the abruptly cancel my show
id10278_qN6dBTlT3HA_00001.flac	i had storage of uh good old boys with him at that time
id10278_qN6dBTlT3HA_00002.flac	and he was going through his crate so his fingers were all being
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00001.flac	alan and jim to produce the show because i trusted them in
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00002.flac	so i signed the deal with with us uh and i guess they clinched alan
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00003.flac	none of that they brought in rennes on who was the most unbelievable researcher in the world and he went all over the country
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00004.flac	to coach and guides i was placed under under orders by allen and jim were not gonna be down on the set like we were with the three cameras show up to you to maintain the uh the flame of le grand
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00005.flac	who the character is and keep him alive someone then i got down on that floor and uh with a single camera and a new crew and so far and so on and begin slogging through the first show
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00006.flac	bing and grimacing that set to punch whatever i'm finding funny and to make sure that the audience knows this is a here and this is my old stunt there is becoming a nervous wreck
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00007.flac	and that went on for about six or seven shows and i was having a miserable time
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00008.flac	i didn't last long with this guy but one of the prizes i did get from him it was after the show
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00009.flac	and i don't know that you can see the slightest bit of difference between that show and then
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00010.flac	gun control which nobody seems to want to touch it at that time
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00011.flac	during the vast majority of the of the married team so i was the chief i was the six hundred pound gorilla
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00012.flac	and i always i mean i felt like such a fish out of water because i got this unbelievable plum given to me my by charlie and i thought i knew newspapers and grim fairly well
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00001.flac	that they could mean something to him and he could mean
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00002.flac	uh the stories i could have heard the companionship we could have had i was the youngest of five so the others were all running in
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00003.flac	who uh the coal miners were striking at the time and among other things and i said well do something about those strikes
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00004.flac	and i think that influenced me in terms of union activities the rest of my life at a great
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00005.flac	that i figured he witnessed a lot that he didn't talk about but he was
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00006.flac	uh my sisters they were a great so both were social workers at one point great my my brothers were strong and bright and sharp
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00007.flac	sc i became a an actor on two
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00008.flac	it allowed me to escape into my romantic it was safe adventure acting as safe
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00001.flac	would drive us nuts because they they work a scene to death and work jay sandage to death trying to shape it up to to their taste and we'd be waiting in our dressing rooms waiting to work and you know being big ben when we work the boys roth mary fills with the tree the three
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00002.flac	so the only time i remember something being disgusted
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00003.flac	uh ted had u turned by himself and gavin and i were sitting in the stands
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00004.flac	now i would watch this i'm gonna try it this way this time tell me what to think
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00005.flac	we would struggle and strive to get it right the first time here he flips this one over and then he does it a second way and he does that and he comes back again he's now this time i'm i'm gonna try this way tell me what you think he did it a third way
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00006.flac	and finally when he did it it was primarily the first method he used to present
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00007.flac	our time on stage was limited once wrote went off and did her own
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00008.flac	saw to be as supportive in every way to each other as they as they could be
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00009.flac	this wonderful band of loonies around her with her being them
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00001.flac	oh yeah i i could never say no matter how nice he was although i must say when it
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00002.flac	the the best examples legrand said i was married to
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00003.flac	heated him uh that's that's a strange how many he maybe once or twice as president of the guilt he was sweet to me he was open to me always took my calls and i think he did great
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00004.flac	made from that and deport all
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00005.flac	by two uh just being around him uh but jack was and jack just kept getting better and better as an actor all his life
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00006.flac	unfortunately when my scene with him were a pistil with him i uh used a rubber gun and uh twice without knowing it i raked his face
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00007.flac	that was so pilloried and editorialized against as that film before
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00008.flac	the the the the arts pages were filled with odd pieces some of the biggest writers in the country saying what a lie what a scandal with this you know i don't even know if they had seen the picture yet it had no it right but they were out
id10278_y990f6UiEEM_00001.flac	loved the they had stronger ness there was no tree he didn't wanna clime there was no
id10279_3qAxPgeIvCQ_00001.flac	the lama is actually called dali lama and is actually owned by the director and the writer of
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00001.flac	uh i remember john d have to talk about how he takes risks and chances and having to create a character
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00002.flac	this might work or not you know how to play jack
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00003.flac	uh when i did pulling down and i played parents i i put busking and excel friends do together and i thought okay mama might work but when i met john heder as uh napolioni
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00004.flac	uh the choices that i made and and with the help and the probable guns of the director uh
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00005.flac	sometimes in films you see a lot of the actors and they're always playing the same type of character but that's how that's who they really are and that's great
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00006.flac	yeah that's fun too you know but i i i i i read a lot i'm at home watching brandell
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00007.flac	you know from from marlon brando to combat role julia you know even the actors of my generation to watch a heath ledger and he could watch his
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00008.flac	and and do he's a character that's loved by so many fans you know and because a film is such a wonderful story you know um where fans can sit together and enjoy from coast to coast from all of the world actually and that's great you know i i i i and my friends and me a picture from israel and there was a sin and but for pad and it was like somebody has painted on the wall my face and i thought like that
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00009.flac	so so even now after seven years when people approached me people are nervous and scared and they wanna hug me like a god your pad like oh my god yes i give her
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00010.flac	its i'm lucky to play a character that people love is supposed to playing the villain where i don't want get you know
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00011.flac	you know and you you you you were embrace that you go high doing they like okay what's your real name and and
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00012.flac	the animated series you get to explore not only napoleon and the world but every single character and that's great
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00013.flac	every episode you get to see different skills there's an episode we see it and he's seeing then he plays a guitar well alright they go can you do
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00014.flac	uh there's gost people can blow up the world could go on fire
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00015.flac	but because it's so pack and it's so flip and hot and i like
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00016.flac	and it took one guy to say and i got on bare and so it was cool but it was just weird
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00017.flac	and i got on board and it was cool but it was just weird
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00018.flac	get a punk but uh security had a show on a pull my best friend i mean
id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00019.flac	still these years later and i mean they're fans and it's coming so you are no matter what
id10279_CmKv2T7ebTQ_00001.flac	you know as actors but when the movie blew up as it did were going
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00001.flac	i would say that even after you have to do a panel and we were sending autographs for four hours uh there was still a huge line and
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00002.flac	for me being able to send as many as possible whatever whatever they wanted cause they're i mean they are it's common
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00003.flac	uh grateful of how many see that you know because you're thinking this movie came out seven years ago and on the fact that we're gonna be a part of not only are we animated in polian dynamite the animated series but it's part of animation animation domination you're going this is we're good
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00004.flac	come on himself i remember john her having to talk about how he was on the panel he wasn't walk the common and he got bombarded he thought that
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00005.flac	the steampunk it was like day of the dead i painted my face people were bumping into me going the punk which is
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00006.flac	which is common behavior i just thought that for those people who are in those suits
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00007.flac	uh yeah as a matter of fact i would like to see my character cross over to the simpsons and then over
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00008.flac	i i i did an episode of american dead actually i played one of the girls uh boyfriends so uh um set and the whole gang they're i mean everybody even with the fox
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00009.flac	so you know i always worry about other studios because i know they want to get to the animations huh domination kind
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00010.flac	i i'm i'm in i'm in all the episodes and i think one of my favorites
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00011.flac	i would say uh well there's two of them there's undertone um uh where where you go see napolioni fighting skills
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00012.flac	and how we go about that and then there's the other one where he becomes a lager town where the
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00013.flac	you know animals can talk goes can happen people can blow up my head could blow up and it's okay
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00001.flac	uh starving starving artist projects say plum and he explained to me about what it was about and you know how he wanted to start up started up and it reminded me of how it
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00002.flac	that could help guy i mean the direction of it's going you know i think for anybody who starts
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00003.flac	they have something out that i can give them some proper guess too
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00004.flac	i have i have some knowledge and with that knowledge that take on then move forward uh into my own endeavors but for somebody who's starting out whether you're a painter or a musician or an actor a uh director a writer i think they have to do with the art
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00005.flac	that there are there are people there you know that that they care about them
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00006.flac	sometimes it could be a lonely wrote you know you meet somebody who can say you don't want keep doing it this is the right direction
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00007.flac	to be told to get you one point eight points so something like that
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00001.flac	well actually working on the show called the plan down for with uh dane bright and steven little and uh welfare so but i'm here actually to support the initial uh film festival i got one of the films called a fence
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00002.flac	that 's right there's actually right and there's actually uh several other films that got a film from argentine that's gonna be uh uh airing tonight
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00003.flac	um and then there's see workshop there's worked up that's being done by arlene who's actually graze anatomy uh when she talks about making it in hollywood and um for those of you who are really interested in being in the business i think it's uh it's ah
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00004.flac	to not only hear from an actress but to hear her perspective because i believe she's from this town and from
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00005.flac	the glam life and the the hollywood life where you wanna talk about going to the parties and mean directors but and that's great but the truth is it starts off uh in your college or start up starts up with community where your
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00006.flac	do short films to independent films and grow into making a big future films but uh it's a quality of work and a lot of people think about just just writing something and throwing
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00007.flac	do that i think it's it's really sitting down with great mentors who understand the business and understand the art and if you put those together and really create something great then it will be big i i i could put my soul into that cause thats what im
id10279_Tm9IlscJgCw_00001.flac	in one of my nerdy teen is in fact i am truly
id10279_UwVmHtdkruw_00001.flac	and besides it's a comedy and and and many people of all generations can sit down and watch and enjoy
id10279_UwVmHtdkruw_00002.flac	you just like the impact towards you you you you would hope that any work you do it will
id10279_bmoAV7tZziI_00001.flac	just cause she's a personality actress you know she's an entertainer and this role as tailed for her when she gets to play
id10279_bmoAV7tZziI_00002.flac	she said for your home and i get to and she has not yet
id10279_f0I1IC6DJfo_00001.flac	uh uh i i love you i really do and i said and and i remember what you said i'm not gonna vote
id10279_f0I1IC6DJfo_00002.flac	i understand it but here's my reason when i was up on stage and rapping
id10279_f0I1IC6DJfo_00003.flac	and then some of the lyrics had a lot of bad words and the studios come to tell me
id10279_nTPJ6asPSV0_00001.flac	my next book twenty fourteen or thirty fourteen for that you got through that gig
id10279_nTPJ6asPSV0_00002.flac	well i am at the time and can and then i met this guy with big glass and a bit
id10279_nTPJ6asPSV0_00003.flac	now i am working on it so this time
id10279_nTPJ6asPSV0_00004.flac	i would know that i like to find
id10279_nTPJ6asPSV0_00005.flac	when you go to heaven or in some like this i been able to see not only the action figure but you see the push and the bad and for the teacher that is
id10279_rPcBjEZlHdo_00001.flac	if you vote for me all of your wildest come true but you gotta sit with uh you got to raise your stone
id10279_uC-yAeDEzFA_00001.flac	that's it but i'm no secret and i just like to keep it real and uh
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00001.flac	this uh with their external called pig otherwise and when the two of them got together they're well they've just they've spent their whole lives together they've never really grown up they're just like kids really excited they do the same things they've always done they don't let the outside world in
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00002.flac	they're just in their own little world and completely unaware of anything else that's going on and there's a lot of energy to both item
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00003.flac	you know that's getting too hot and she's always the one to bring them back down and cause pigs like is a bit more
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00004.flac	mad than she is but he never gets to express that because she's always there to bring him back to kind of reality in a way she's also a lot deeper than i like more in touch with her feelings and
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00005.flac	that he's just you know everything's just kind of black and white and so it's kinda hard to talk about the characters separate because they're so close together you know i mean you have to talk about
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00006.flac	kind of routine they play the same games they have these role plays that they play the whole time
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00007.flac	and we're just like the games that kids would play like we play that game game yeah okay and they were into the game you know and you grew up to that as you go
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00008.flac	of their world like and they went when they get to the palace it's gonna be amazing they
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00009.flac	king and queen of the world and so i think that one knows she will get to the palace eventually
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00010.flac	i just found it really strange but then after that i got into it and just completely fell in love with it and i like i'm a complete scraper
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00011.flac	the big difference to this one the base of that is a complete love story
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00012.flac	its it gets very dark and it gets really interesting in that way and because
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00013.flac	reflect a lot of relationships in the sense that you know when you first meet someone your relationship keeps growing and growing whatever relationship it is like especially like with a boy girl and when you get passed a certain stage if you're not prepared to keep changing with the relationship if one person does the same you know i mean if they don't change
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00014.flac	it's going to end one press might be what the other one doesn't and that happens all the time and
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00015.flac	and as well because it's so intense and it is unhealthy because they haven't developed properly
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00016.flac	she you can see her even when she's reading back over you know with the sides you know doing a scene and she's kind of thinking of maybe to add something else to it
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00017.flac	you know i mean lives and i don't think it's a matter of age it's just a matter of understanding ness
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00018.flac	i don't know once once you can feel the story like case a lot of people would read it and just not get it at all because of the way it's written and then like you need to see it performed as others
id10280_IhCiRuNjZfY_00001.flac	diana and i play one church in
id10280_IhCiRuNjZfY_00002.flac	lavish um she's quite um yeah experimental i suppose yeah lucy she comes from a family
id10280_MEa183Zyf5g_00001.flac	john whitfield and she has a man back to the land in that time so the only thing that pulls her that brings her back is her friendship for henry there's no way she's gonna miss that wedding so that shows how strong they
id10280_MEa183Zyf5g_00002.flac	so she has to to face a lot of a lot of past issues that she hasn't dealt with that she's kind of run away from
id10280_NXjT3732Ekg_00001.flac	and uh they got quite a good attention to
id10280_NXjT3732Ekg_00002.flac	i mean it to be honest i don't know what to expect i i i i think
id10280_NXjT3732Ekg_00003.flac	pleasantly surprised and um you know entertained and
id10280_Np6typH1VKE_00001.flac	i think she should know exactly what's going on and where we are in the story
id10280_Np6typH1VKE_00002.flac	to just take each situation as it happens and when people are talking it's like i understand what's going on but it doesn't so just to go i don't i don't like when they talk about all this cause it just it confuses me and it reminds me that
id10280_Np6typH1VKE_00003.flac	he'll say you know that he's pleased and that's as far as i'm concerned my job my job is to please him
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00001.flac	angular otherwise known as gallium she adds half nice cause her mom is his half
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00002.flac	i know if they walked into a restaurant and everyone would stop and stare and i think she quite enjoyed that so in the beginning of their relationship and it was a lot of fun a lot of excitement living with her famous uncle you know and coming from a poor family so she got
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00003.flac	in time with that character so um i got to know gelled really well and every day spent time with her son
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00004.flac	just because she's so full of life and it was just a real it was just like being in sunshine every day it was just so refreshing to brando but then towards the end of filming and
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00005.flac	we had quite difficult scenes to do a ken and myself and they got quite intense and for the first time ever i wanted to escape a character
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00006.flac	um you know you couldn't just sit read them and just yet
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00007.flac	an easy scene and they had to be quite well worked but um with nick the director who's absolutely brilliant and with a just you know we block the scene and then because he's just so brilliant just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00008.flac	so slight and i suppose you could just read it you know once read it one way and then another time read it another way and nick was brilliant cause he pinpointed moments and we tried it a few different ways and so on each scene you just you felt
id10280_XiKRlssBw2M_00002.flac	should be international you know when someone has a story to tell and it's it's universal generally and um it is interesting to think that your voice might be dulled you know and and i i i i listened to it before when i was on a plane once and there was a film that
id10280_XiKRlssBw2M_00003.flac	one and i got to earn myself in a few different languages which was really impressive but then i realized i couldn't speak those languages so that was kind of a bit of a shame i could always learn the language but might take too long but yeah i know i think it's great that you know a drama that's made here
id10280_XiKRlssBw2M_00004.flac	and why not let the world see it so to come to this event to showcase the great drama that the bbc do cause they've been doing a hell of a long time and um it's it's great that other countries have the opportunity to purchase it and then
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00001.flac	known as alum she adds half nice cause her mom is his half
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00002.flac	i would stop and stare and i think she quite enjoyed that so in the beginning of their relationship and it was a lot of fun a lot of excitement living with her famous uncle you know and coming from a poor family so she got
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00003.flac	in time with that character so um i got to know gelled really well and every day spent time with her son

id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00005.flac	um you know you couldn't just sit read them and just yet
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00006.flac	easy scene and they had to be quite well worked but um with nick the director who's absolutely brilliant and with a just you know we block the scene and then because he's just so brilliant just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00007.flac	so slight and i suppose you could just read it you know once read it one way and then another time read it another way and nick was brilliant cause he pinpointed moments and we tried it a few different ways and so on each scene you just you felt like you were doing work
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00001.flac	john wakefield one killing rampage and killed six people and her mom was one of the six so her relationship with her dad
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00002.flac	diminishes and he sends her to la to her grandmothers and um she has
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00003.flac	he tried to to get on top of it all and she she has run away from a lot of things the relationship that they're dad she hasn't spoken to them in all that time so i mean i think it's probably it is maybe
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00004.flac	and how the characters interact and and then how the events kind of turn ice and how they react to those events then that kind of
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00005.flac	well yeah that's when the people can do pools and and decide who they think the killers and and and why and i mean the amount of conversations we had because
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00006.flac	well i mean it you know it depends i think different people will get different things from it and i think they throw a lot of things out there
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00007.flac	the beginning to make you kind of confused just to to what's going on but um but yeah i mean you know we were just we'd get a script and then we'd be eager for the next one and we're like
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00008.flac	i suppose it's it's most similar to reality shows you know i mean cause it was originally pitched does that and it's um and and and the way it was hard you know everything was
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00001.flac	much better great grandmother i mean about her mother and the only kind of role model of a woman that she has is a great grandmother so i think that's why she's a bit that's why she's not even innocent in a bit kind of back
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00002.flac	he never kissed a boy and like you know her friends have what she hasn't and it's
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00003.flac	because the only woman she has two generations will do then i like m and she meets so when she meets jonny
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00004.flac	literally it's a different story but so when he goes away she finds like she's pregnant for a month later and tells her dad and her dad like he loves her some watch but he just he's so annoyed that you know it's against her religion
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00005.flac	oh that so she kinda feels that she has to go and find money to make everything okay and she goes over to bring home to find but it's harder than what she thinks she
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00006.flac	cause she takes everyone on face value also when she tells them that she's pregnant
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00007.flac	you know is that maybe her father had to react like that instead so it's kinda like she's seen the bits of her father in that her father
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00008.flac	he's not bad to you know i mean he just has his way of bringing up but
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00009.flac	so then i was kind of get myself into the frame of mind because she's quite different to me and
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00010.flac	you know if we're if i had an idea i wanted to change you know just
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00011.flac	you know he'll listen it it's not just like okay this the way we're going and we're not changing for anyone you know he'll have completely open minded and he'll think about it and say okay what actually if he if he disagrees he'll just say look i think so or if he agrees he might just say oh yeah actually may be right so it's really easy to work with him and as well
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00012.flac	he wants something more so he'll just say a few keywords and then it gets you back on track kind of and he's he's really good
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00001.flac	so it was created by written by staring executive produced by directed some wrote some of the music by
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00002.flac	i play his love interest and his backup singer and
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00003.flac	so he uh back in the day when this was happening there were uh four of us living together three women and dennis character johnny rockets
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00004.flac	and um then you know now present day he has a daughter show up that none of us knew he had and she wants to be famous and we're like right let's here
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00005.flac	has money she has money and then it turns out she's actually over talent
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00006.flac	dennis so he's such a sport about really just the self deprecation he put himself through
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00007.flac	well he he describes it as he created the show based on some guys who who didn't quite make it so you know and thought that that was sort of more interesting and that side of it so there are
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00008.flac	in the show whose characters did make it and then but he didn't so it's that uh you know monday morning archer
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00009.flac	and even more than that i think it's relatable to anybody who has a family of
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00010.flac	you know if you're a human you come from some disfunction and that's really what this show is about is kind of one big
id10281_FL2UicCNcwI_00001.flac	take it from somebody who got their molars very early in life being in love is a fantastic mystery that takes
id10281_FL2UicCNcwI_00002.flac	beautiful is not a crime you know and for your for one one i adore your fat
id10281_FL2UicCNcwI_00003.flac	to break it to you angel but you are no longer the only girl in nick parker's life
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00001.flac	well um i'm on the host comedy for stars for stripes and i'm a big animal advocate so i'm i'm right at home with this um i've worked with tatum
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00002.flac	for and then a documentary that she has in the works and then um i am on the board of several
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00003.flac	cold and i know that's not the most advertising soundbite here but me
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00004.flac	it's tad's project and i don't know where things are a you know with it i just know that i was one of several exports that she interviewed about um sort of animal rights and and what's happening with them and particularly with um
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00005.flac	oh my gosh a lot okay i saw i have a christmas movie coming out called anything but christmas and then right after that i'll be um scott's ex wife on his new show dad run
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00006.flac	but but um my pet project now are every intended really um i'm launching a new animal project called the matchmaker and we lunch in january it's a multimedia project it's a huge project so i'll beginning the word out about that
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00007.flac	um i think the best place right now is to come to me um twitter lane for the number four animals and then my website an hundred stores
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00001.flac	really what did denis say because denis and my character like we're all about sex but he said
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00002.flac	uh so excited for you to meet them i play a um johnny rock played by dennis his long time girlfriend backup singer and we've had a wild wild ride together we've done everything i seen everything and then some and um and along the way i have stuck with him no matter how disfunctional he gets and it's just it's real love it's true love um and i do everything i can
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00003.flac	it was pretty coast and we were at like hearing palace or uh i mean erving place plaza erving plaza
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00004.flac	for long weekend in plaza or the um or the apollo all these
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00001.flac	family and a very dysfunctional family but a family and i mean let's face it if you're a human you understand this function on some level um so i think there's gonna be something in there that everybody can relate to and you know it's
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00002.flac	if that's her thing she committed to the rock and roll life that's that's it's
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00003.flac	and through so they are committed to each other they've seen everything
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00004.flac	you're gonna get to see that really she wanted a family all these years despite all the the drugs and the sex and the rock and roll um she wanted a family and now she gets to have that when johnny rock has a daughter who shows up that they never knew he had um and then there's also a really fun you know spoiler alert that i'm not gonna give um and the very final episode that when i read it when i saw the script
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00005.flac	tracks but then once we got going the guys uh john carpet already knew how to play the guitar jonas who plays a base he learned how to play the base and then robert kelly who plays drums he learned how to play the drums so by the end of our ten shows for this first season everybody was playing
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00006.flac	um i just did a lot of research on rock and role i did a lot of research on on drugs that like that she probably would have
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00007.flac	anything other than prescription drugs that i've needed of for various you know a surgery or you know whatever but um yeah no i've i've not but i'm very i'm very pro like i'm very pro mariana actually but yet i've never smoke
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00008.flac	kinship and loyalty and so it's you know a rescue me which dennis did years ago and i had such huge success with it was a one hour drama with comedic elements and now we're doing a half hour comedy with some dramatic elements to it so it it is very very funny
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00009.flac	dennis like we threw it all away he would give us a script and then say come in and her
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00010.flac	going on at all times and so it was a very messy and raw and i think that's what
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00011.flac	joe is coming to our set to do it and she was some like she's just a cool
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00012.flac	and she played herself but like it did involve some acting and so she was great and she was a game and
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00013.flac	most it's dealer i think that's kind of what all of us were drawn to i mean he's so specific and his style he's so successful and he's just a great guy he's he's a really great guy to work for
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00014.flac	and he over the years just he knows a lot of people and he's stayed in touch with a lot of people so you know really kind of just involves a phone call and then if someone's available so
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00015.flac	of the show it's it's it it makes it it makes it very specific and it makes it gives it its own
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00016.flac	is that uh particularly the the men in the rock industry like choose a look and then they stick with it and so johnny rock chose a look and he has stuck
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00017.flac	good all the time and has kept it but given it a more modern touch so uh it's fun because even like there's no off switch with
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00019.flac	like that it just it it doesn't happen except for in sex and drugs
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00020.flac	good question um first person who pops into my mind who um i get likened to frequently and i take it as a great complement with charles
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00021.flac	word intimate a little loosely you know i've now intimately worked with them but to me
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00022.flac	and lisa said that before and i don't see it i just don't see it and maybe it's because i've worked with them both up
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00023.flac	yeah so i don't know but you know that just is a guest you know in the eye of the
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00025.flac	it's great for animals but it's also great for your health because we're really not built to consume as much meat as we do in modern days so if people knew what was happening to animals if they really knew and if they really absorbed it they would i i believe they would make different choices and and a lot of it's just getting people
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00026.flac	on the eating front that people that somehow it taps into like this um survival and this person i i have to eat meat to survive and then it does become a habit like no i i need this and you actually really don't you really really don't you just need protein but that protein does not have to come from animal sources um so yeah and i had another thought but it went well
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00001.flac	years ago i made what i call the fortunate mistake of watching an undercover for video and
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00002.flac	my honored at the national animal rights conference with their guardian award and also with a tele ward for my work on
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00003.flac	is a funny thing getting an award because it's not really about me it's about the work and i just happen to be the veal
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00004.flac	a dream to merge my work in entertainment in my work with animals because i believe that we can end animal suffering
id10281_WUg4pRp5_Co_00001.flac	and a lot of like drama inside that comedy which of course is what makes it funny because it's just so absurd and so kind of real and in this crazy dysfunctional world so yes
id10281_Yw8v8055uPc_00001.flac	it's just insanity and i think everybody just kinda wants to be a part of that it's like going
id10281_dX8RBKI2FKc_00001.flac	my function is really like to help protect him usually from himself but really like he goes off the cliff i'm going off
id10281_dX8RBKI2FKc_00002.flac	gilles who plays dennis daughter on the show and yeah and everybody's playing live instruments and we we are a sex and drugs and rock and roll
id10281_dX8RBKI2FKc_00003.flac	but i think i'm gonna be here in los angeles i'll be in new york the days before for the premiere and press and what not but i think i'm gonna come back here and have just a little
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00001.flac	we're so comfortable with each other and i think actually in our own weird way we're we're very much in love
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00002.flac	yeah and hollywood and um and then that changed it and and i started focusing and acting and now
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00003.flac	you know i am i like to think of myself anyway as a good happy person who likes to help others and be positive and and so i get to really exercise that shadow side of myself who's not so
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00004.flac	yes well my organization is the matchmaker yeah and um we inspire and celebrate rescue fostering adoption of homeless animals
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00005.flac	there 's so many um parts to that that were just disturbing from him from the alleged killer luring him out of a pretend area to what they did to the to the line
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00006.flac	yes saturday six o'clock kid bungalow
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00001.flac	the motion capture actors for alex wesker and resident evil revelations too and you were
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00002.flac	i was hired um for a video game and actually i didn't even know what the game was and i went in and i had to do all of these were fittings and
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00003.flac	had no idea what the game was and it wasn't until then
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00004.flac	fifteen that i started getting messages and started using images of all
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00005.flac	sixty and then they put all these different like probes on me
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00006.flac	have been a big fan of the original and it was i think it's i really need story i was first introduced to the series when i was filming in australia i was doing a walt disney movie called inspectorate to there and some cast mates and i were just hanging out
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00007.flac	course seen the movies and in what not um but then when the revelations came up i actually haven't played it yet
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00008.flac	i haven't seen it in its entirety i've been getting all kinds of messages though and um sing fan art um a lot though
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00009.flac	i think it's really cool to be a part of this franchise and a super super
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00010.flac	uh i thought it was really cool and i think i did a great job of capturing me i've seen
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00011.flac	playing um an evil character playing games that involved you know a certain level of violence but again i didn't know what game that was um when they hired me all top secret
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00012.flac	so they didn't tell me a whole lot um but i just knew that it was gonna be
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00013.flac	thought it was really fascinating i thought it was a lot of fun and the fans have been incredible um i would also love
id10281_o-L8P0xj3qk_00001.flac	thank you i you know i i'm a big believer my acting styles bringing calit i was i'm a classically trained dancer and so
id10281_o-L8P0xj3qk_00002.flac	and so that's just what i i do for every role and at that ends up
id10281_o-L8P0xj3qk_00003.flac	is the type of film that as an actor if i sang the screen i'd be like
id10281_qBTOwaSOS-M_00001.flac	nearer to my heart right now is my own animal rescue organization that i'm a founding member of called animal rescue or do we do large scale rescues like puppy mills wording dogsled sled dog
id10281_qBTOwaSOS-M_00002.flac	animal rescue organization that i'm a founding member of called animal rescuers
id10281_qBTOwaSOS-M_00003.flac	that's taking up a lot of time but it's so worth it like i love every single
id10282_37XQxZ5lBD8_00001.flac	but it's a very a very real journey i think as well i think that's why people can relate to it because you know they are some
id10282_37XQxZ5lBD8_00002.flac	i think when something is so iconically ones you know you i wanted to get it right so i get a lot of time with
id10282_CiUT-YF34O4_00001.flac	then everything else is tied in with that you know you got these on top of it and everything
id10282_CiUT-YF34O4_00002.flac	the simul cam shot of giant grabbing you and stuff your body's not moving in the right way or if even if the cameras just slightly off and the whole
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00001.flac	comes back to her roots because she misses her her family and her friends and she's very close to her brother and and then all this kind of
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00002.flac	my house and actually taught me through it because with it being um fixers you know the the peddles keep moving without
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00003.flac	so you can't actually stop so it's terrifying and very hard work but it really good man and a great challenge so yeah just it a lot of kind of scaling up and down the spice jackson in my house and yeah
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00004.flac	it was very scary it was very very scary to be um amongst them and uh to see the you know the lifestyle that they lived but um at the same time that was kind of what was really exciting about it and what i love
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00005.flac	relationships that you thought were so solid in the first series are gonna
id10282_OjG2EYFgubs_00001.flac	and standing up to people if if you don't agree with them like not conforming
id10282_Q5fbv-Wyj7k_00001.flac	this being my first kind of big film big break both of them which was so supportive they're really nice they kind of took me under their wing
id10282_Q5fbv-Wyj7k_00002.flac	this is a big a big thing for me it's a big thing for everyone but um you know it's my first break i wanted to make a good impression i wanted to do everything everyone in the movie justice and i wanted to do the character justice cause it's not often
id10282_Q5fbv-Wyj7k_00003.flac	that was kind of quite intense but i i loved it i really embraced it
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00001.flac	it's amazing that's when you kind of depend on brain kind of talk through it and
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00002.flac	um previews of of what he's plan and what the giants looking like what's how the how the movement of the scene is gonna play
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00003.flac	depends on him following her the beanstalk so you know we have to we have to um create a relationship with
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00004.flac	definite and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with and special effects and there's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's a great family movie and i think that people love to kind of go to the cinema with their family and and watch something that everyone can
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00001.flac	um well i think thomas is a great character for any actress to take on you know and they're rare those great characters that they don't come along that often um but
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00002.flac	but then to progress into lady of ampara and and a gentleman's wife it's it's such a great
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00003.flac	yes very much so very much so in the relationship is growing the more they get to know each other but there's still turmoil you know
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00004.flac	right after season one um and we've just lost our child so we're dealing with that and ross is going to be tried um
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00005.flac	season two s is very exciting and upsetting and it's a real rollercoaster the whole series
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00006.flac	well i worked very hard with a fabulous voice coach for weeks before filming um because it was so important to me that we got it right you know it's
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00007.flac	absolutely love it so we really had to nail of that and get that right and i hope i did
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00008.flac	but it's um yeah i think throughout the series as well i wanted to to soften the
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00009.flac	absolutely so that's been that's been great to to work with i often say that i work very closely with the costume and makeup people to create this realistic look that changes as we get
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00010.flac	with it all um you know he's such a lovely person he's um i think he's a bit
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00011.flac	to be honest it's just given me so many more opportunities acting is which is lovely you know it's great to be a part of a show that's been such a huge success because it's
id10282_XtwIcZPYN_8_00001.flac	she'll do absolutely anything for him you know she is quite a few scenes that she tries to you know save his neck
id10282_XtwIcZPYN_8_00002.flac	think over that and trying to move on with their lives so you know there's a lot of emotion that's exploring the reality of being married and actually how hard that is and i think that's what people love about
id10282_YmJBoCojXf4_00001.flac	really was but um yeah i mean at the same time you've kind of got to contend with than really selling how terrifying these giants are so there is a lot of pressure that comes along with that as well but it was a great time
id10282_YmJBoCojXf4_00002.flac	the priest stuff that they've shot with you know them all the
id10282_YmJBoCojXf4_00003.flac	the stuff that they've shot with the bill already and obviously his stuff was played back to us on the motion capture
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00001.flac	her roots back to her family to her brother and um yeah back to back to the life that she left of being a pop
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00002.flac	to be perfectly honest with i'm not entirely sure it's me
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00003.flac	a different side to me that i've been wanting to kind of express for a while so um so it was it was great and immediately i was grabbed by the project and then really different suddenly i could really throw myself into
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00004.flac	with cars real careers during filming and and it was really interesting to actually
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00005.flac	to speak to them and i think you would expect there to be much more accidents than they are but
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00006.flac	a realistic film and i think i think we've managed to grab that you certainly get
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00001.flac	young and she's passionate and she was born into the royal family she didn't choose the life that comes with it so
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00002.flac	and have her own experiences before she takes on that responsibility you know she doesn't just want her
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00003.flac	got an incredible vision and he's he's great at kind of sharing that with you you know when someone is that kind of inspired it's it's amazing to kind of you really feel that and it gives you hope and it makes you trust them so that you know that you're in
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00004.flac	the the best time working on this i mean it was such an experience of rollercoaster from
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00005.flac	just any tom dick and harry roger or you know it's it's ahead it's led by brian
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00006.flac	the movie that we've we've all achieved together you know we became a real team and i think that we have we have something that's really cool and hopefully will be a great film that will be part of a family's life you know either for young kids or or adults there is something
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00007.flac	like that is fantastic you know we did a lot of training for the role so we we wanted to be able to do our own stunt to do justice to our characters because that's that's part of the twist particularly for isabel is that she is fit and she she is searching for adventures so she throws herself at everything so i loved all of the actually mean obviously interacting with giants and being put in the harnesses so it made it look like the giant had a whole view was was incredible and then you're turned upside down and throwing and i remember my mum came to set and she was
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00008.flac	i found the scene at the beginning in jack's house really challenging because even the dialog in that scene as well kind of creating that relationship between jack and isabel that is so crucial to the movie and you only have one scene to do with him because in the next minute she's taken up the beanstalk so kind of creating a chemistry between the two of them that was believable that he would then clime the bees talk to rescue her was was a challenge and then also when the beans stalker up through the floor that making that kind of look realistic was was wasted
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00009.flac	reading fairytales at night is not i hope it's not a dying breed by any means but now with you know tv film i had whatever there is something in a child
id10282_hgB5ziAudzU_00001.flac	pick up sensitively from where you left off and is being tried so
id10282_hgB5ziAudzU_00002.flac	to deal with but i think the main thing is real life marriage and this other woman that just works
id10282_nYsLbFOQfOI_00001.flac	yeah i did um i'm not sure why but i just thought it would
id10282_nYsLbFOQfOI_00002.flac	and being the hero that uh rosa is he managed to
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00001.flac	yeah well it's actually really interesting cause last time we were here the show hadn't and no one really knew what it was so i'm kind of excited you know to see what people's reaction was for the first
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00002.flac	um well the great thing about season two is that our characters are very much already established so it's basically working on the relationships that you feel so solid ink
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00004.flac	fiercely protective of human and she'll do absolutely anything for him you know she has quite a few scenes where she tries to you know save his neck basically because he's
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00005.flac	he stands up for what he believes in and and doesn't necessarily think about the consequences of that and how terrifying that it's
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00006.flac	uh i'm halfway through book six so yeah cause we do two books at a time and
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00007.flac	yeah i think i think at the heart of it you know it's the story of an underdog it's a story of a real romance and you know you have these incredibly relatable characters at the heart of it i think that's what people love about it and um you know it was such a huge success before so you know doing a new adaptation of it was incredibly scary because obviously you want it to be as good as them
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00008.flac	it's um it's been it's been really nice to me and i think the the thing to remember that it is different from the previous
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00009.flac	and it's you know it's a new adaptation of the books and um and that's been really cool you know it's lovely to have
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00001.flac	um well i think thomas is a great character for any actress to take on you know and they're rare those great characters that they don't come along that often um but
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00002.flac	but then to progress into lady of ampara and and a gentleman's wife it's it's such
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00003.flac	yes very much so very much so and the relationship is growing the more they get to know each other but there's still turmoil you know
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00004.flac	right after season one um and we've just lost our child so we're dealing with that and rose is going to be tried um
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00005.flac	this is very exciting and upsetting and it's a real rollercoaster the whole series
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00006.flac	well i worked very hard with a fabulous voice coach for weeks before filming um because it was so important to me that we got it right you know it's
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00007.flac	but it's um yeah i think throughout the series as well i wanted to to soften the
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00008.flac	absolutely so that's been that's been great to to work with i often say that i work very closely with the costume and makeup people to create this realistic look that changes as we get older
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00009.flac	with it all um you know he's such a lovely person he's um i think he's a bit
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00010.flac	to be honest it's just given me so many more opportunities acting wise which is lovely you know it's great to be a part of a show that's been such a huge success because it's
id10282_rC63HnQ3Nf8_00001.flac	it really was but um yeah i mean at the same time you've kind of got to contend with the sand really selling how terrifying these giants are so there is a lot of pressure that comes along with that's who
id10282_rC63HnQ3Nf8_00002.flac	that stuff that they've shot with the bill already and obviously his stuff was played back to us the motion capture
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00001.flac	hard work but yeah i mean it's it's amazing that's when you kind of depend on brian to kind of talking through it and to show you um previews of of what he's plan and what the jane looking like what have to have the movement of the scene is gonna play out
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00002.flac	so you know we have to we had to create a relationship
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00003.flac	eight the beginning of the film that was kind of you know that was very difficult and it took us quite a while to kind of find the right balance
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00004.flac	definite and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with and special effects and there's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's at
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00005.flac	with this being my first kind of big film big break both of them were just so supportive they are really nice they kind of took me under their wing and and made sure that i was okay and that's that's
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00006.flac	you know this is a big a big thing for me it's a big thing for everyone but um you know it's my first break i wanted to make a good impression i wanted to do everything everyone in the movie justice and i wanted to do the characters
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00001.flac	well it was a sort of a long process really and i went for my first audition and i just read them
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00002.flac	like a series of auditions after that and then a series of workshops and then they offered me the part so it was a long process but it was thrilling and sort of the adrenaline you get from it and it is
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00003.flac	i mean making this movie was so much fun i mean i loved absolutely every
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00004.flac	anything really i mean just anything that's a class and that i know that i'm really gonna enjoy something
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00005.flac	really get stuck into it and i quite like to do like an action film which has a bit of sod fighting or something in it just something that i've not experienced yet
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00001.flac	really great position where i could kind of pick and choose what i wanted and i started getting offers to do a lot of in a big studio movies and none of the scripts excited me and i just started looking at different things in the world that were disturbing me and i'd sit in this website we could go to land and pay ten thousand dollars to walk into a room and shoot somebody in the head and the idea to sturmer
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00002.flac	so much i said through this i'm just gonna write direct produce do my own movie have completely you know creative
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00003.flac	and after he saw the movie he invited me to his house to watch a movie and uh i think we were watching the gates or hell or some old film and uh we started talking about differ
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00004.flac	you got right that right now so i just ran home playing my phone shut off
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00001.flac	yeah it was great i mean i grew up in boston and there's a certain type of guy from boston we called
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00002.flac	the drink and you know i went to i live with those guys i got beat up by those it was one of those guys so a lot of the times you know when you're on set you could kind of act like that and be like
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00003.flac	but quite in london i mean brad was do and i was doing the marriage the whole time and there was a pearl and i was like
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00004.flac	these guys in my head for eight years and now i get to hang out with them this is so cool so but you know the beating scenes it was very cathartic to get that out of your system but you know the truth is that when i'm filming a death scene i get happier and happier as the day goes on as i'm getting my shot
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00005.flac	conder up to the most painful darkest stuff from your entire life and bring it right to the surface like it just happened ten minutes ago so i notice that the end of the day i was just drained i don't wanna talk to anybody you just want to crawl into a hole and die and then get up and do it again the next day so certain days were fun but on the days when i had to kill somebody it was really really a much more intense
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00006.flac	thing that you were never supposed to do but you know there was a real purpose to it i mean this wasn't for a shock this was and you know and we were shooting going okay this has to hang with inglorious basterds so i gotta bring it as
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00002.flac	facebook may be the social media but you know if you're you know fourteen fifteen sixteen or your early twenties and you've grown up with that you know all these different tricks you're the your whole mentality of how to use social media um how do you a phone it's not
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00003.flac	it's completely different and what's terrifying to me to someone in their forty s that there is nothing private anymore now he's a whole generation that's grown up with no concept of privacy there there
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00004.flac	scoping but we grew up in this era where kind of all of your behavior for me before
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00005.flac	it's not recorded thank god so um i wanted to show what can happen that what terrifies me is the idea that you know in the time of fatal attraction you could do something like this maybe your wife found out maybe our people at work but now if you misbehave you cheat on your wife you do something wrong it can literally be broadcast to the whole
id10283_Ma_3RlzPUOM_00001.flac	together i go well we really need to start press in a week he said what i got out to have this house and these people moved out and we have this area because you to answer
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00001.flac	it was a combination of several events one i was watching the old seventies cannibal films
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00002.flac	never make that movie today because the jungles are like there anymore you know it's gone it's all disappearing i thought okay that's my it's like it's not
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00003.flac	to protect the jungle to stop you know the uncontacted tribes but at the same time occupied wall street was happening and during occupied wall street there was a relative of mine who is occupying and i remember he graduated college and i was like is he working what's he doing and my mom was like oh no he's occupying and i was like well what's he occupying against men hasn't really been screwed everybody anybody like grew up in a nice family and went to college like why he goes to his friends they meet girls you know that's and i just thought okay are
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00005.flac	sabar when he's like ping and there's a total that's a real poison torrential that's falling man so everybody in the cast fully fully went for it and i think that's one of the reasons the movie really works when you see them they're in the the dirt and they're surrounded by pig shit in there get bit by but there's no make up there
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00006.flac	like we had to send cast members to the hospital we had to take get yellow fever shots we had anti malaria pills we had to get deep parasite afterward
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00007.flac	amazon it was crazy when the girls when the kids drop a snake on cure in magna's face that is a real snake that was i was standing there and the kids turned around they're like the they're like oh the kids have an idea and they had a baby python and i was like what do they want the well the the kids start be funny if we throw it in the cage with with you know the americans and i was like actually that's a great idea were gonna do that and so we did the take
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00008.flac	i look at the if you freeze frame at the things like two inches from biting your face so it was just that kind of a shoot but you know what
id10283_QitLqlca660_00001.flac	i you know he told me the story and i said i will do anything to help you make this movie we read the screen playing bring it to our partners are new to mark abraham where a fantastic producers and you know made a lot of great movies and then we take it to universal with that team and then we bring on bill calling the corn comes on for the fight and it just snowballs
id10283_QitLqlca660_00002.flac	not just seen another fight you're moving the story for but you're really unfolding another corner of this world with well okay that's the roads okay these guys go underground that's really cool okay these the falcons they live in the trees and you know it's a jungle village we want it to really create
id10283_QitLqlca660_00003.flac	universe and thats what we spend a year and a half in the writing thinking of every clan thinking of their weapon thinking of what their relationship is with other clans so that you know there
id10283_QitLqlca660_00004.flac	you know also the rhythm the theme of the dam there there was a lot but you know it's it really uh kinda harnessing what he did with wooden he really was able to produce all of that and really bring in debate and russell crow and one west and was clearly all these people from all these different worlds um you know everybody coming together and
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00001.flac	and that's okay cause to me it was always make believe and pretend and i always thought no matter what i'm doing on a movie set there's nothing worse than what's going on in the real world i mean people
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00002.flac	and he said oh they're just pigeons like these are creatures these are animals and actually remember make the guilt tipping
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00003.flac	i couldn't i couldn't be in the house where i couldn't be friends with this person knowing that these people left their dog out they're suffering and and they had this attitude of it's just a dog but you could see how upset this animal was so i had very i'm always very very affected by violence and real life and certainly violence against
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00004.flac	in good fun i guess he could say but um i wanted to use that attention that i get
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00005.flac	where this hobby we had collecting all these cards we now have them but we just like i don't know what
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00001.flac	in december of two thousand four and then after like you know we spent the day going through script because hey you wanna hear some going to base
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00002.flac	around april of two thousand while he was writing it was like my passover cater as with all my friends in boston
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00003.flac	one calls me and asked me to you know go grab food with him so we're at dinner and he's like look don't has to be a real character this is it's got you gotta know this like your best friend it's gonna be three hundred and sixty degree person you now who's this part and i was like well quite and i wasn't gonna do that research until i knew i had
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00004.flac	we gonna be like in like a leading role of brad pitt and he's like yeah like we do a toast like hers and we just he's like that's it but i dropped everything put on forty pounds of mussel went to boston and
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00005.flac	i never wanted to see it's everything that i had fantasized about
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00006.flac	it's exactly what you would do it's like this dream that you had and you realize that somebody else had that same dream and now you're sharing it with all the other people
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00007.flac	i 'm sorry but it was one of the best screens it felt like the energy of the red carpet of can was in that room it was i've never been in the screen like that it was like electricity
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00008.flac	he had a movie i mean leading up to it he shows the good the bad in the ugly show the dirty dozen
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00009.flac	we like it's a tailor shop around on this bar firing into a crowd and when he said the ending he's like darker the sun
id10283_arklnCzCq48_00001.flac	the business is changing to such a degree that you're finding that movies are kind of small video releases or it's marvel and clearly what audiences are going to and what theaters are booking are star wars movies and these kind of event superhero films so uh it's certainly there's a lot of fun you get a lot of money to play with i mean they don't they don't
id10283_arklnCzCq48_00002.flac	it's interesting it's a it's a whole other universe it's happening right now
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00001.flac	i first had the idea to write and direct cannibal holocaust
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00002.flac	believe what i had just seen and it was before the internet so i couldn't just go up and look up information and i tried to find it in every book and i was in
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00003.flac	actually killed people and i studied special effects i'd seen every makeup effects but i had never seen anything so effective the film making the documentary style and of course the ortolan music um and that was what began my obsession with the movie and of course reading about roger and subsequently realizing that he had directed other movies that i loved as well um but it seemed like he really murdered
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00004.flac	every review ever by anyone the
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00005.flac	they talk about this cable holes can halls and the hollywood
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00006.flac	become over time the gold standard for like it's like the ultimate outlaw her movie there's nothing there is no
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00007.flac	i was going to work and to really start the movie i was paying myself for my own money to fly the crew to go to peru and while we were there like right before shooting i was when the financing came together but i had to say yes we're going yes were going we were fighting the weather and then we were in the jungle and i started production and every day i was thinking i really today i really need to write more
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00008.flac	tell him right when i get back in december but by then the news had gotten out and i felt i felt terribly that you didn't hear it from me first
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00009.flac	this is the inspiration and it's a very different type of story and the name of the green inferno but the idea was i want
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00010.flac	well that's kind of i'll do my mind anybody has the finger thing that you'll see tomorrow night on other things but
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00011.flac	really for a modern american audiences because it couldn't be as strong as cable holly cost it's a different story but i want you notice in the credit it
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00012.flac	the world and uh cannibal holly cos i want people that i maybe have never seen it that are too scared to see it to watch green inferno and then go find cannibal holly cost if they haven't
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00013.flac	i like i like it or do i like the scenes with the natives when the natives come on the road i think
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00014.flac	but the one were reshot is by age the rat of god cause they call it the poor and we went
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00015.flac	but the difference but also bad for my
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00016.flac	the difference obviously very i think that what makes cannibal holocaust that a lot of people don't know is that you are the everybody knows you are the assistant director to train but not many people know that you are there
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00017.flac	his writing crime novels and detective stories now and his crime films are incredible i mean you made great crime films as well but when we think of lens i think of the italian crime and if you look at cannibal ferocity
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00018.flac	and in cannibal frocks they're finding at it's more it's the keep coming back to new york
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00019.flac	back to the police but lenz loves the detective stories so i think that instead of
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00001.flac	every single day there was no trust no running water these people had not only never seen it
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00002.flac	there were poison stinks and trails it was the man it was no joke it was it was scary at times but uh i'm glad we pushed it and did it and
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00003.flac	make me a better director it's actually much easier to direct uh you know at forty than at thirty and i feel
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00004.flac	lots of reports of it when we were in part to crazy stories it was insane and once we were in the jungle we realized as a thousand stores in there it's a it's an amazing place i mean we you know cannabilism it's it's the last unthinkable thing
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00005.flac	they were awesome i mean there were villages they weren't like people that you'd expect like they weren't like cannibal holocaust whether actually people that live in
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00006.flac	parts into care because people actually shipshape real body parts so we had we had fake heads and fake arms and all that's too competed but costumes and even thought was fake explain it was a movie it was very hard like it was it was
id10283_eC9ZIOvohds_00001.flac	on tarantino directing me i could i could turn off that directing had i mean when when you're going in as an actor you know what you're getting into and i said i wanted to be the dream actor i wish i had i just fully through myself into the part i put on almost forty pounds of mussel i went back to boston where i grew up and only talk to my accent and created the role and created the character and you know i just became possessed by a really really giving him
id10283_eC9ZIOvohds_00002.flac	i say as long as you know i mentioned eighty six it's fine but the truth is we get mad about the mets in eighty six but the painful things were more mad bob stale and calvin surely you know i i i can't hate the met the way i hate the yankees i just can't
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00001.flac	but a bunch of kids who get a cabin in the woods they go there to have fun and they get this flesh in disease which rips through their flesh and does horrible things and they go crazy
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00002.flac	movie that was both funny and scary where like in the style of american werewolf in london or evil dead to where you're laughing one minute and just so disgusted you're laughing the next and
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00003.flac	your trap somewhere in the woods and it's like your friend turns into the flesh eating monster only this time it's this real disease
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00004.flac	fifty million dollars so when you're making a movie on that low budget you've gotta find you know you gotta be created you gotta push the gore
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00005.flac	you know you gotta be created you gotta push the go push the scar you totally tally incorrect really making a shocking and violent
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00006.flac	history of human nature when people get leprosy they're sent to leper colonies smallpox they're put in isolation and two years ago when the sars outbreak hit china what did they do they sealed those people off they didn't take them to the hospital cause nobody knew what this was and nobody wanted to get it they see those people in a building until they figured out what the hell was and i think that the kids aren't monsters i think that they're just behaving the way kids behave and that's one of the things that's made the film i think such a success in america
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00008.flac	animating i like drawing i like painting i enjoy doing all these things i like inventing new ideas that's why i'm here in frankfurt we're meeting with other inventors and scientists and engineers um you know that's that's fun i think i get forward when i did the same thing over and over and i think it makes you a more better

id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00014.flac	get a form i do it because it's so fun being around that guy i learned so much about directing
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00015.flac	i learned more from david lunch than any other director i mean he's so nice he says
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00016.flac	mental institution he was totally psychotic and this other the old guy behind the general store with the white beard he'd never been in a movie before so i thought these people had such great
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00017.flac	southern flavor uh stylistically i sat down with my cameraman before we shot and we watched texas cinema

id10283_h87Y8nir1o0_00005.flac	there was nowhere in as a camera he didn't know what a camera was so we had to show them and they don't get
id10283_h87Y8nir1o0_00006.flac	people will come out of the oven unless you've seen cannibal holocaust and its water gets cold the old burners i've i've never
id10283_h87Y8nir1o0_00007.flac	parts into care because people actually shipshape real body parts so we had we had a head and face arms and all that's like compacted by
id10283_h87Y8nir1o0_00008.flac	and eventhough i was fat we explain it was a movie was very hard like it was it was a crazy time shooting in paro uh and shooting in the amazon but we went we went way up the river farther than anyone's ever gone before and it was the hardest thing i've ever done in my life we we were an amazing crew an amazing cast and it really shows in the footer there's nothing there's
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00001.flac	about a couple of american friends a friend from iceland that are backpacking through europe and they're looking for european girls and drugs and all the kind of stuff that can't find in america and they hear about a hostile in slovakia that's rumor to be filed with beautiful girls so they go there and it actually is and everybody hooks up and the girls seem to love americans and then one of the friends disappears and it starts to lead to something darker and more sinister and the guys eventually realized their traps into something really horrible is a really violent journey into hell and
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00004.flac	a movie there's nothing worse than what's going on in new orleans i mean i can put the most violent stuff in a film and people know it's fake they're paying for a fantasy they've seen the actor
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00005.flac	during interviews they know they're alive so it allows them to enjoy the violence what gets people desensitized is when they're school shootings every week it's when we say oh another ten people were killed in a rack when we have this
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00006.flac	horrifying than anything i could ever put in a movie and it's real and that makes people thank god you know there's no police there's no army no one's gonna save us everything's gonna fall apart there's a horrible rations the racial attention and nobody's in charge that's what gets people desensitize the
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00007.flac	was it never really felt like work or started like work um you know quentin loved cabin fever and invited me to his house to watch a movie after he saw it and we struck up this friendship where you know he showed me old movies like black belly the tarantula and you gotta see this movie shown of the dead and i got him a printed shoo the dead and introducing to edge right so you know i was kind of meeting all the young filmmakers and he was showing me a lot of older movies and he really became one of the only people i can trust in hollywood
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00010.flac	drop dead fried with rick mae was known as one of the funniest scripts ever written and some dutch director came in and like didn't know how to use richmal was like
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00011.flac	genius and the movies a mess so it's like it was frustrating for the director it was frustrating writer it was frustrating for the start you know it's just kind of have the wrong ingredient
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00013.flac	that and and i also produce my own movies i think for me the only way to do it is to write producing direct because if i write a movie you give it to a director and they screw it up it's like
id10283_j5ArtKwbobY_00014.flac	you know it's so frustrating mean there's it's like this a movie drop dead fred with rick maal was known as one of the funniest scripts ever written and some duch director came in and like didn't know how to use rick mali was like a comic genius and the movies a mess so it's like it was frustrating for the director it was frustrating writer it was frustrating for the start you know it's just kind of have the wrong ingredient but when you have an idea in your head and i write it unless it was a director
id10283_j8UugkSTzzk_00001.flac	the title knock knock came to us uh actually when we were we were writing the film was nicolas lopes our called writer we were thinking what could we call this i mean
id10283_j8UugkSTzzk_00002.flac	knock knock we love the simplicity of it and what it led to and just you know the knock knock joke they're knocking on the door than showing up in the middle of the night uh i like a title that gets you thinking and leads to other mysteries and it was a very simple title
id10283_j8UugkSTzzk_00003.flac	all of my films before uh are very bloody they're known for them
id10283_j8UugkSTzzk_00005.flac	in mind um but in this case we wrote it for genesis for lorenz is you know i'd worked with lorenz is an aftershock and hemlock grove and she started in the green inferno so we wanted to write a character for
id10283_j8UugkSTzzk_00007.flac	film he's warm and sweet invulnerable and nice and i think what we're seeing now is a huge turning point in his career we're seeing what we're gonna get for the next year thirty another twenty five years of leading performances from him but i want this to be his oscar nominated performance i want people to watch nock nock and go oh my god on it was so funny so wonderful it's a real real actress piece he's just
id10283_oGZsanLiXsY_00002.flac	i mean we we love low budget mainstream at low budget high quality you know we don't we don't want anything to look low budget that both of us have done movies in our own way we've learned where to save money
id10283_oGZsanLiXsY_00003.flac	fifty officers and all the stunt people i said i remember the scene in the club there's a girls and heels and skirts and i said i can't believe she is all these hundreds of stunt girls and he's like stunt girls gringo these are models i was like what i was like they've never been in a movie like no
id10283_oGZsanLiXsY_00004.flac	not so worried about everything you go about it so then like we close our eyes and we drop thank god no one got hurt
id10283_oGZsanLiXsY_00005.flac	i was pinned under the concrete in the cemetery i looked around and i saw all the graves and there were skeletons and bones and hair and i said god i the our department did an amazing job this looks so real it's like a department like what he's like they just let us in an hour ago this has been closed since the earthquake they literally open the door and let us then shoot there because there's so many areas that destroyed they can't use it we just walked in
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00001.flac	craving was one of those names that as you got older his films grew with you so when i was a kid it was before carson
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00002.flac	was the film that you're friends elder brother saw so you have them going oh that's a movie and they take the girl
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00004.flac	the last house on the left and it has this kind of harry nilsson poke music done by david alexander hess i remember thinking like god this is nineteen seventy two and this is two thousand the you couldn't use this music in a movie today and i thought that's it i'm i'm gonna do it i'm gonna track down that music and so i took six songs from the last house in the left and i got the guy who plays the killer who sings these songs it was his kids did a cover for the credit it was meting super super g and t
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00005.flac	me and he saw he heard the last house and left music and i was like oh my god this guy's the real deal and i met west and i was like uh high nice meet sorry i stole six your movie
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00001.flac	uh about five or six years ago this trailer showed up around halloween uh for a movie called clown where guy puts on a clown suit for his kid's party part and he can't take it off and he starts turning into this monster and the hair he keeps cutting the hair and it grows back and he rips the nose is it and then it said
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00003.flac	you know even though he hadn't done a feature his commercials in videos were so smart that he was part of this collective smuggler films and his his stuff just looked amazing everything he did had that real beautiful clean polish um and i just knew if he applied that aesthetic to a horror film he'd make something really special his second film cop car is fantastic
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00004.flac	it was it was a pleasure it's it's it's nice when you work with the director like john it's the same experience i had with west making the sacramento dunstan during last exercise where you can just really be there as a support but justice
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00005.flac	grimm's fairy tales going back hundreds of years i mean those are the oldest or stories there are and there's a reason we've been telling them for
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00006.flac	eaten by witches and eaten by trolls so um when you're dealing with clowns i think what makes clowns
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00007.flac	that they are around children and that we do let them around children and that when we his children were so fascinated by them that you think oh my gosh this is a grown man that we let around kids just because they've clown makeup on and then
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00008.flac	someone could you know use that to do horrible things to children so i think that's where clowns started to get a bad names being creepy and there hadn't really been a hard filming a while that explored that and i i think that when john came up with that was so clever is the idea that it's not the
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00009.flac	as it's the suit that's evil that when once whoever puts this on its gonna transform into this thing and in that way it really becomes much more like the fly and that's what i thought was was brilliant was their way in to tell this story that it's not just okay close scary let's make a scary movie but what if you were just a dad trying to do the right thing to help your kid and you dressed up like a clown because the clown you wanna do show the birthday party and you just put on the wrong count
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00010.flac	you really feel for this guy as he's trying to resist the urge but um you know we wanted to stay true to the fairy tale mythology and that's where we made a movie that was you know probably
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00001.flac	good hard there is uh you wanna have some sort of message underneath it i never like to go to the movies and have a history lesson forced down my throat but i love when i'm watching a gory movies over and over and watching people's heads be ripped off and guts get torn out and then you realize that the
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00002.flac	told me about this earthquake that hit in february two thousand ten chilly and it was an eight point eight
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00003.flac	basically society collapsed where he said it was a whole generation their iphones went out so nobody knew anyone's phone numbers and without gps nobody knew how to get anywhere and he was he called this girl from on the phone she was like yeah i m at the cost that there's just a
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00004.flac	i had heard he was auditioning people for it and then the night before he leaves her brilliant he's like and i'm saying i want get some food i'm like sure i knew he was making this movie and i hadn't bothered him
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00005.flac	am i gonna be in a movie with brad pitt as the barge in i'm gonna do the bat he's like like can we have a toast he's like yeah here chris listen it's got to be
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00006.flac	about that and so i sat down with them but literally did and then i was like well and then i said
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00007.flac	killed and so it's like their parents were in america but everybody had cousins that were things that like they grew up watching everyone coming back in there
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00008.flac	it's different it's care like i've a you know i do like it's okay you can get the mercedes now it's different it's like the generation they've really it's they're all the food he is dead and the new people and i brought my parents over it was a very moving experience they were like we were we should have come over sooner this the best thing for anyone jewish go to germany that people are wonderful as it was great and we're sitting at the premiere
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00009.flac	parents we all just burst into tears it was some weird even though we knew it was on the as my father said there was the historical reality and the emotional
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00010.flac	connected with everybody so that's quite so tuned into these things that he just does you know that everyone's
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00011.flac	as i did animation and i sang that song is singing for my friend nobels and i we now each other in the seventh grade we were watching this
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00012.flac	yeah my dates at my father's a psychoanalyst it was a professor harvard recently retired but my parents were great they my mom's a painter they took me to all kinds of movies they believe i should be allowed to see anything i never saw a movie violence is real i always saw
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00013.flac	you know i went to go see alien with my dad and i was like so terrified i was eight years old i was freaked out and then at the end when we were started taking her close
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00014.flac	i looked at me like are you gonna throw up and just my parents looking at me it was psycho i was like and i ran down the iles and projectile vomited over like three rows of people
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00015.flac	just like a mini pie jumps a bucket like you're with your date and it's just
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00016.flac	so on you and then runs out and i remember like following me in the bathroom i'm like mom they like no more noise it was like
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00017.flac	when i played on film as we had two ambulance calls which was great one person passed out and one person painted on the later and rolled down which is great
id10283_rUnfAxF1dJI_00001.flac	the two girls who can't physically overpower on i have to have them tied up they've done it before i mean they're not like boy scouts they they understand it but i need him to be tied up in a way that it looks like these girls did it and he really can't move so we you know i wanted to look kinda cool you know he got to make sure the
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00001.flac	yeah it's been great i have a good team you know it's fun it's like a whole our whole chilly wood crew with nicola slopes are a team
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00002.flac	in chile and christina and in and are burns the whole cast
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00003.flac	exactly well that's the whole idea is that i wanted to use the camera work to tell the story into a show character and there's three kind of moves through the house where we take our time going through the first time is just introducing everything the second time is at night and the third time is the end when it's just completely
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00005.flac	big moment here um and it was just such a pleasure to work with canaries and uh you know find incredible incredible talent like arms and give her her english language press amazing amazing
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00006.flac	yeah i look i mean there are movies like the strangers and funny games that i i really like but uh one of the things that struck me about peter trainer's death game which calling camp was in in nineteen seventy five very very little seen film it really kind of a masterpiece um is the the way these girls show up here just the premise of two girls showing up at your house and cheating on your wife and then they won't leave and it really unravels your life and what happens when you lose control
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00007.flac	kano lets the vampire you know in fatal attraction dan makes the mistake you know i won't nordan like it's dan's fault and that's what's scary that you know whether it's a hard candy or even polanski's death and the mate is a great job that was that was a bigger
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00009.flac	also i'm forty three and the way i would use social media you face baker water anything is completely different than the way a seventeen
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00001.flac	i remember the icelanders were like did you the american doesn't know how to shape like they're looking at me they've come out
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00002.flac	for a country it can be scary going to a hospital especially when you walk into the doctor's office
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00003.flac	so finally she liked she goes can have a sample of it and i went
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00004.flac	and i was like game it was some crazy ringworm infection that i got and
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00005.flac	it was uh that's what inspired the movie i thought well you can be totally healthy and
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00001.flac	and when you're when you create a new show it's like watching
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00002.flac	basing it loving it and the show was wildly successful and hopefully
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00003.flac	tarantino she like the fans are the same they love it and it's a really great when you can get
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00004.flac	scary story set in that world you know every country has their own monster
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00005.flac	country has its own you know the the goes into a pan with the girls and the the well that hair
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00006.flac	every country has their own horror stories and people love it when you can take a classic like the vampire where frank inside the monsters and reinvent them in an interesting way and that's what we thought crime are really did with his novel him grove and we wanted to create a series that felt something like and more the style of david lynch wines but almost with a touch of a douglas melodrama but something that was spooky and stylized intelligent fun and it was really great
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00007.flac	of all people really people are fascinated with a small town
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00008.flac	in life and we've created we worked very hard to create a universe that is something special and unique and of
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00009.flac	our significant other it's like a serious offense and a relationship um but no it was it was instrumental in the member season one when they we talked about all thirteen episodes to going on at once it really changed the way we could write the show we didn't have to write for commercial break we didn't have to do recalled
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00010.flac	it's right there in your home you're with your friends you put it on you watch another one and another one and we knew that you know one of them
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00011.flac	like we love brian graves novel and the first season we were fitting thirteen episodes to that novel so there were times you could feel where we were stretching we felt in watching it after we got okay i could feel this when we stretched it a little bit to get to this story
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00012.flac	deal much deeper into her character because she's such she's such an incredible actor with such an amazing range we wanted to show all the different layers
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00013.flac	olivia and we we fit it to ten episodes so that everything the story story story we wrote it knowing that people in general are watching for you
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00014.flac	a series of ten and sitting having those huge moments like the transformation obviously we want
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00015.flac	turns back into a human what does that look like we've got to see what that looks like and peter
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00016.flac	we we realize that at ten episodes we were just a little more focus and we could really make each episode like let's focus on making ten amazing amazing
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00017.flac	episodes and really putting really writing those huge kind of big set pieces that our people go oh my god i can't i've never seen that done before um and everyone it was just a little more manageable was a little more
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00018.flac	thirteen worked for the book but now that we were um you know created
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00019.flac	on our own without the book we thought that it would be really you know let's make ten really really
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00020.flac	yeah i mean check work hour james camera a dark angel like the guy he's he's worked with so he's such an amazing range of experience working with such great producer
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00021.flac	creators um that what was really nice was we had you know we had the book last year we had
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00022.flac	amazing to last even but it didn't feel like we we didn't have that one so the book was the central voice and we needed one person that could really be the central voice in the filter for all their ideas because i'm gonna have a million ideas but i also don't
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00023.flac	my presence i can't just show up like hey guys what if we do this like i need to we we all agree the best way to work was to everyone kind of filters everything through thick and you know i could say what if like
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00024.flac	like saying him i was like what the what if like to see what happens to peter he's been so careful about being a fare like not being being aware of like and just and where he can transform and it's such a secret of thing that he would only like romans like what if the beginning of the second season he's just doing it to a bunch of strangers and we realize just how completely far gone he is and how he just doesn't a fuck about anything then checks like and i was like what if he's doing it like just for some people and hand checks like no man he just like he's i was like what if he's doing it like
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00025.flac	making them think they're hallucinating and think it was drugs and tricks like you should be doing as a rift where like that's it like it's like a drug deal or using it to like trick people into thinking there locating to sell drugs to get some drugs to get money like and that's what we loved about chick was we could say what happens to you when you're you have
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00026.flac	ability and you force it against the wrong mood how does that start to make you go and say what does that we have
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00027.flac	it was really a meteor from being self destructive been going on some kind of crazy drug bench are not supposed to do a um but the idea but then
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00028.flac	understood how to take that idea and immediately incorporate it
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00029.flac	that you understand why he's doing it like and that's what's great about someone like chick is he could take any crazy idea we through at him and really understand how to turn it into a story and turn it into character based story i like think visually think of ideas of characters this that and you know cause obviously she's a you know a director and a creator and writer and we all have ideas
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00030.flac	but chick is uh is so experienced and cool and
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00031.flac	love and he's he was a great addition to the shot he has his own ideas as well so he just it just became one set
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00032.flac	and how the network made david lynch on mark frost savor a polish murder and the frustration that led to the
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00033.flac	really about the people in the town and then they saw of murder that to come up with windermere new villain the black lot which i story line i love but you could tell
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00034.flac	we explained it as we talked about a three season three to five season macro arts where were the characters are
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00035.flac	we but after the first season we sat down and we looked at those metal this is where
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00036.flac	we had you know sort of a multi season plan for where the characters were going
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00037.flac	we were going to go and then we brought in check who's like completely fresh set of eyes who just watched it as a fan he's like i love the show but here's where i would take it and you're like oh my god that's actually an amazing idea so it it was a combination of sort of knowing the mark of where we were going to go but also seeing what worked and we're like everybody loves the guys here when you see roman and peter
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00038.flac	i read it i was like what's please tell me shells in dead like hell
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00039.flac	you could see there are a lot of people that have that in introspective poetic sense
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00040.flac	what there were ideas i mean i had a idea we wanted almost we're gonna do a graphic novel of a bridge between season in season and there were there were still
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00041.flac	some kind of graphic novel or something you know it's it's a whole universe that we love that we'd love to keep expanding one
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00042.flac	um but it's really up to the fans you know fans gives it can just stick with the show and give season to chance it only allows allows that's the opportunity to further explore it and many
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00043.flac	certain forces there's a reason everyone is coming to loot and there's a much bigger picture at play as to why this town is becoming the the text for all this particularly to have
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00044.flac	i mean it's something you know we we want to lay the groundwork for a show that can go for many seasons and explore many
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00045.flac	he loses its potency upon repeating you know if you watch a comedy
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00046.flac	with horror the very thing you go for is that scare and that's the thing once you know it's coming it's never as strong the second time so when you create a show you have to make so much more than that it can't be about the scare it's gotta be about the characters and the story the intrigue the universe the world and those great moments and those great lines and the things they do in the way they dress and the way you know it's such
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00047.flac	you know we we wanted we've we're we're laying the groundwork for a really really rich universe that we want to explore in two hundred different directions but it's really up to the fans at this point if people continue
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00048.flac	no uh you know we we love the fire action um but the fiery action generally informs at that
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00049.flac	the long and these characters in his head for eight years before the show so now the fact that everyone else is there a part of that universe created he loves
id10283_vv4mvANXHcs_00002.flac	those are the people i wanna see crashing the jungle and just get eaten because from the point of view the villagers they're just invaders they just see them as people dressed in construction sites tearing up their land and they've crashing their back yard they're gonna punish them like invaders so that's what's fun for me is the clash of
id10283_vv4mvANXHcs_00003.flac	what you work i mean the village had to be a real functioning village and we found this amazing village in and the whole village got it on the making the movie and they loved it it was it was so much fun a lot we to conceptually explain to this village what a movie was there so cut off with no electricity many of them had never seen a television before let a learn
id10283_x6M3KQ8-gM4_00001.flac	wow that's great it's kind of an oddly pro vegetarian movie even though i am a big stake eater uh i couldn't help it you know you see the civilized meat eating in the restaurant were they're mistake and then of course they're in the jungle and the sad truth is that eventually we all are basically food we're gonna be warm food no matter what whether we like it
id10283_x6M3KQ8-gM4_00003.flac	i just want a case so more than that more in the sort of it was people i just wanted to cause just because they felt they needed one and that's like a very college thing to do and it always stuck with me those grew the image of those girls sitting they're going this is unfair we're striking for the janitors and then on the weekends they go back to greece to their house
id10283_x6M3KQ8-gM4_00004.flac	oh man i would try and charm them i would tap dance i would be like the entertainer i would teach them how to whistle i think like i could show them really good survival skills but no ultimately i would be you know i'd i'd be done hopefully i'd be too hard to eat maybe they'd have to like burn if i want to wake to be like alright that's like eating a bar but they'd probably have to skin me i wouldn't last ten minutes with those camels it was hard enough
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00001.flac	i didn't know the the meaning of pain so i rushed to the dictionary and read it i didn't know i was involved in any
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00002.flac	one of one of the critics said where was his hand in the scene
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00003.flac	the more you curse that showed that you had no language ability no no sense of what
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00004.flac	you we all have just so many words programed into us
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00005.flac	so i didn't speak much as a boy the day before yesterday it was in the library of congress in
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00006.flac	indulged in saying i don't i don't like the language used on television today is
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00007.flac	yeah but you turn on turn a classic films now and your watch and you see wonderful old movie dangerous the language was not as if
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00008.flac	cary grant yesterday and i then called monkey business and it was wonderful wonderful
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00009.flac	well i don't know i i just like to excite people i i like people to share share
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00010.flac	well i don't know i i just like to excite people i i like people to share share
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00011.flac	i i bills had a program which was wonderful called
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00012.flac	exciting today i watched a lot of tv and everybody yells at one another they scream at one another nobody listens to what the other person's saying but they all
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00013.flac	plans out something and yours the actor have to obey everything he wrote he wrote we spent years with tendency
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00014.flac	i think i think there are a lot of good play rights today but the theater has
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00015.flac	off broadway off broadway but the united states is rich in tiny theaters all across the
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00016.flac	there's original theater where people can watch plays off
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00017.flac	oh yes but some of the musicals were great in those days i mean guys and dolls is a great great musical oklahoma all of us
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00018.flac	there 's a thing called onca where they revive little pieces of great great musicals of the
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00019.flac	because it always seems to be on the verge of dying and yet it it it revives itself every every once in awhile a great play ride comes along and and the theater has a new a new lean on life
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00020.flac	right then you had the theater with great great shakespeare
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00021.flac	films radio films television all of them and they have not been able to put away the fabulous invalid
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00022.flac	we don't make up the language we we obey
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00023.flac	the actor is is the one who brings back to life what the play writer's written
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00024.flac	orchestra player so i bring to life when the writer has written and the director has created with the other i am just
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00025.flac	the the best good actor i've ever met and i said what do you mean good why not great why not
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00026.flac	a part of the course has the mother a wife have children but the other part the talent part the actor
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00027.flac	i would lie on the bed i was in the far legion and was getting
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00028.flac	i'm going and she'd walk out and i knew then she'd lay out the the food for me to eat but that i was in my glory
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00029.flac	spent two years with henry fonda peters
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00030.flac	making an indentation making you aware of what life
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00031.flac	i went to do my first film when it was over i rushed back to do to continue as an okinawan one
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00032.flac	the stage manager said there's somebody important out front is please don't tell me that i don't want it it makes me nervous but i came out and i
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00033.flac	an actor doesn't mean i'm a second class citizen i have to be a participant in a society so
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00034.flac	felt it was a society that protected the idea and the thoughts
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00035.flac	your hair stands up on the back of your neck when you when you read what he what he wrote and all of it when
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00036.flac	strindberg all are very very generous and exploring the inner thoughts of what's to appear on a stage and we're lucky to have had them
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00037.flac	keep thinking now you have tennessee williams you have a miller
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00038.flac	it it reminds me of pantheism you put
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00039.flac	art and you step aside step back and then you have
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00040.flac	it it's always fun for me to indulge in that mysterious
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00041.flac	as an italian did research on the civil war that was rarely done an american film
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00042.flac	clinics would bless them began to do and analyze just what one did the clothing they ware the way they they walked the way they rode all of that is a part of our
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00043.flac	i 'm lucky to have shared in it i spent three and a half months in the jungles in cambodia in i called what part of the the united states was preparing to go to the war in vietnam and i'm making movies based on a book
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00001.flac	that the first imprint you make on film stays with you the rest of your film career the first film i did was called baby do and i was rather
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00002.flac	i don't think there's anything more violent than what's happening in the world today you talk about films let's talk about the attack in the subways let's talk about yet no let's talk about angola
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00003.flac	you say so that you can't blame the movies or television for
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00004.flac	i don't know whether whether it's an exorcism whether it's a catharsis by seeing a violence in a movie uh some people try to emulate what's in a movie a barman may see something in a movie and decide to go bum something you see so i think there should be less violence there should be
id10284_O_rxcwBWTz4_00001.flac	i don't know what does one do that with me a lot of the times i was angry what didn't i just
id10284_O_rxcwBWTz4_00002.flac	we only do that with me a lot of the times i was angry why didn't i just
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00001.flac	conrad's lord jim and each morning i'd go to have a bowl of soup with
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00002.flac	cambodian man who ran a little stand sort of meetings and he used to smile at me we spoke nothing together you know but he smiled at me because i was
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00003.flac	i think making films used to be an expression joined the navy and see the world it's now join the movies and you see
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00004.flac	no but i i have a feeling that there's some affinity you know if you think of what's what's the word where you're resorted where you come back or someone else what does that word
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00005.flac	uh but uh of course the first formative years
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00006.flac	feeling and and i wanted to channel it somehow i didn't know i used to fly on my bed and pretend it was the sahara and i was in the far legion and i'd get shot in the arm and my mother would come in and say it's time to eat and i'd say i'm bleeding i'm bleeding you see i was acting a constantly acting who
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00007.flac	fire torturing a petrol tool in the cambodian jungle somewhere and here it is my dream
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00008.flac	i thought well at the play just started why isn't he playing
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00009.flac	but and this model goes on as you're doing the play i said well maybe he doesn't like me then the other part of me says the id part says but he paid his money he's got a perfect
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00010.flac	and we didn't do what the lunch did who after a few years of marriage or shortly after they married said made a pack and said we will never appear
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00011.flac	toward the end of their lives they began to appear separately we've not had any rule of thumb
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00012.flac	at some wonderful opportunity comes up for in a film or a play and she certainly welcome to do it i mean in the last few years she did a play called inquest
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00014.flac	the actor has been worried about the economic aspects you see england they he becomes
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00015.flac	red thing and he's the legion of one in russia he's an honored artist of the soviet union and
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00016.flac	i would say that the best thing that can happen in america and more and more the big companies of funny and they're devoting certain of their funds into the arts because you must people must have more than just the
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00017.flac	forest for the mind you see a good play not only entertain and amuses you
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00018.flac	yes it does i mean there's nothing better more cleansing than a good cry
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00019.flac	in having had a diverse career and moved from mediated
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00020.flac	uh loving to to as the fama does plow up his soil every every few years jump from a television show into a play into a movie in that way you become
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00021.flac	movie i was on the stage in those of the august moon playing at
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00022.flac	and caan came to me and offered me a part in a movie called babida written by tennis williams
id10284_Rzpm9hlXV6I_00001.flac	teacher of of acting has developed their own methods they've accepted what it came from originally stanislavsky and rush
id10284_Rzpm9hlXV6I_00002.flac	loved him there was no pressure there was no hysterics it was love
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00001.flac	the next performance i didn't get the laugh which taught me a valuable lesson that you don't do it yourself they have
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00002.flac	it's wonderful it's great to find a thing like that and to use it
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00003.flac	tell tell you on the critics come do previews you do you play for a week
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00004.flac	that pulls the actor the true actor back to the theater all the time because there's the
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00005.flac	you'll you'll open a door and say i will not that's all i take you half a day to shoot that
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00006.flac	although people get a lot more claimed for a movie work than they do for stage work but the most satisfying for me is doing it on
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00001.flac	i was the crew chief on an airplane at all took place on an airplane and all the the the plane crashes and all the men go back they're dead and they return home a cheerful subject for just nineteen forty
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00002.flac	and the play lasted a week i didn't think i would last either because my voice wasn't louder
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00003.flac	together and case had directed the skin of our teeth and wasn't happy with his direction of fantasy so he picked a little scene from a one act play of williams called ten blocks on the camino
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00004.flac	and he wanted to just work on it as a director and i was playing in mister roberts at night after the show was over eleven fifteen we'd meet at the actors studio and we worked to one o'clock in the morning and he directed then he showed it to tennis and tennis was absolutely astounded at what hasan had found in a fantasy sense with this scene
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00005.flac	so he said incidentally they're gonna do my play the rosette and he should play magical so that's how i got to play the rose
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00006.flac	the performance can change the message of a play the play out with a man who resists becoming a serious who resists the current who stands up and defies people you know he doesn't
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00007.flac	never to question or doubt her selection of whatever it is what college she wants it was you remember they used to be the the flapper girls
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00008.flac	the work i was playing an oriental the following year a few years before that
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00009.flac	four nights before pal joey had opened and they buy the poor actor dancer who was superb in the park so i came out to take my curtain call thinking if you're boom gonna be right back
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00010.flac	i was terrified and they didn't move but the reason they like that place so much it was the first time americans didn't take themselves quite so seriously and i didn't think they were gonna inform the world of their brilliance
id10284_rOcOdev0azY_00001.flac	he's not only mastered the craft of acting but also the art of caring
id10285_5nGO1Mq_iGM_00001.flac	it's just an annoyance at this point we're obsessed i'm not kidding like we left our mad men prepared to go play
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00001.flac	to be the best person that she can be and she might fail at it but
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00002.flac	continue to grow i think she will continue to be flawed uh but we know what happened to those when
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00003.flac	private life and whether or not she ever really get a handle on that or whether she winds up with
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00004.flac	for people especially for people that have been loyal and sort of watched all of this
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00005.flac	but also satisfactory in a way of finally getting to delve into these
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00001.flac	yeah and the truth of what happened you know and the truth of what happened behind them
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00002.flac	did all our research for summary and dan and her team
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00003.flac	very detailed and um it has a lot
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00004.flac	um information that obviously isn't necessary to kind of put in the film um but for me and for everyone else is really helpful the to have that
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00005.flac	and then to even just do the scenes over and over when you're constantly sort of
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00006.flac	that they used and you know they're real and there's george bush's name and you know signatures and
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00007.flac	of people in general from that time that i would never would have known there
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00008.flac	into that part of it um she i think she does she didn't know that
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00009.flac	obviously has played um couple of extremely well known uh real life people and she was talking about it and i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00010.flac	like very interested in what she was saying cause i might be doing that and i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00011.flac	so good at it but you don't feel like she's impersonating anybody you feel like she's
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00012.flac	is so uncanny in toronto bob wasn't there but dan was and i found after watching the film
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00013.flac	they both have this sort of heroic legendary quality you know they both have that so even though they don't necessarily
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00014.flac	somehow it's that you really can replace bob with dan
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00015.flac	and with them i'm actually on their side i think that what you know i think that mary was right and what they do
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00016.flac	that she investigated and told on sixty minutes was
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00017.flac	as of of of the story that that she investigated and i think that that i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00018.flac	and you know i wanted her to kind of have that sort of um reality to her um besides that
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00019.flac	the first time he cried um and when we saw in toronto he was very emotional afterwards i mean i can't imagine what that's like to have sort of this story told that is a very important time
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00020.flac	and to have robert read for telling it you know the need to have somebody so brilliant doing it so well
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00021.flac	somebody who is a secret of truth and he's somebody who is really
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00001.flac	the year old actress in new york i was like this is amazing please please let me play this part um and i loved her and i loved the character and she
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00002.flac	um and then it just grew from there and you know the the the script is obviously what attracted all of us originally and then when we all got involved you know started to meet the cast and the cast was some and the producers room
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00003.flac	and that didn't work out and maybe she's supposed to be like don maybe supposed to be a man maybe she's supposed to cut herself off from being a woman
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00004.flac	and i think that you know over the past three seasons that was her sort of art and and in the four season i really feel like she's starting she hasn't yet but i really feel lie she's starting to become the person that she
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00005.flac	and she's starting to become herself and not feel like she has to be um something that she has seen or someone that in the office or someone you know that she's ok
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00006.flac	you know they make mistakes and they do bad things but they're not they're not bad people you know and that's very true to life and that's very true to to humans
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00007.flac	the jobs are selling happiness every day to the public and
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00008.flac	and you know that against you know their own struggle for their own personal happiness is very interesting so i don't consider any of the characters bad people um they do very
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00001.flac	i mean everyone is so nice and uh tom and louis sort of worked with the most and um they couldn't be nicer gentleman honestly we had
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00002.flac	like one of the funniest people i know he's hilarious to basically in between takes i just it's like giggling at everything
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00003.flac	we filmed in belfast uh which is really cool cause i've never been to ireland so it was really ally some i really loved i loved ireland honestly
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00004.flac	it's such a well respected festival that's such a range of films from small films to a bigger you know a big block fester films and i think that you know there's sort of a a a case in a respect that comes with the festivals so it's it's it's an honor in a way you know um that a few festivals are but i feel like people have a lot of respect for
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00001.flac	he actually um part of the reason is i don't remember anything so i didn't remember what happened in the first episode til i saw it i couldn't tell you what happens in the second one i'm very good for spoilers because i just don't remember what happens i've been asked recently what my favorite episodes of the show are and we had to like go online and look at all the seasons because i couldn't remember what happened when um so i'm just bad at it so it's not really even any i'm not like some like export at it i just don't remember so i'm good for
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00002.flac	that episode sort of surpassed i think what television can do has done you know it's sort of set a standard um that i certainly cannot take solder i mean it's a brilliant script
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00003.flac	i do feel like you know mad men and even dead and buried yeah
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00004.flac	very much not up to me but uh i i not want to look at gifts in the mouth so you know we never know but i think i'll pause just the second and let people enjoy madmen
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00001.flac	just come along way obviously i don't think her journey is over by any means
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00002.flac	seasons the first three seasons were all about especially the second season there was a big arc was all about her figuring out you know what it meant to be this woman in a man's world and did she have to be like don or did she have to be a man or did you know did she have to play up her sexuality or otherwise
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00003.flac	who she is and how she can just be herself and she doesn't have to be either one but she just be herself and um i think the the idea of the differences and similarities between then and now is one of the most intriguing things about the show for the audience and you know just playing that game of comparison and it's definitely sparked a lot of um discussions and and questions and i've been a part of them
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00004.flac	first start watching the show and you know there's that first funny thing of like oh my god look at that that's so different we don't
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00005.flac	episodes started to see things that you see here now and things that either you've experienced or seen someone do or do yourself and you start to sort of get uncomfortably similar
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00006.flac	to those characters and and i think that that's what has sustained the show past it's the original sort of gimmick of it being in that time period is that these
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00007.flac	beings and they're they're they're they're people just really they're still like us and we're still like them and and i think that's something that's become far more interesting than just being in
id10285_dG-z37iVdzA_00001.flac	i realized what we what we're missing what we need those more monsters with
id10285_eZFHx8-7rX0_00001.flac	self as an individual that that's a good way of putting it is like a better version a better you not necessarily changing who you are
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00001.flac	i was really happy with it i mean i was very happy with my storyline you know she's had a rough road as far as relationships go
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00002.flac	the bad decisions and uh a lot of hung over mornings and i was happy that she got the most romantic scene one
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00003.flac	this um huge theater with like thousands of la uh i think they like a live stream dat or whatever it's called and so we watched it with like a bunch of people a lot of fans were there
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00004.flac	the show was always made sure that the other actor on the other then the phone was always there so you had to come
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00005.flac	and do your other side of the phone call off camera for the person it was like a rule that particularly one was different because he was in a big serve um so they didn't want to bring me out there and i sort of insisted that they got me on the phone for it because it was like our last
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00006.flac	like i have to be on the other end of the phone so they actually turned the pay phone into a phone so that he could actually call me and it was super early in the morning so i was like in bed obviously
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00007.flac	and in my game is like with coffee and like my cat like all of them
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00008.flac	with john like playing john he's like crying and i'm like trying to get the cats to be quiet
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00009.flac	it was really heavy and then the painting was kind of award and kind of a large and they wanted me to hold it so that you could see it in certain shots and then the cigarette is actually
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00010.flac	trying to look cool like trying not to drop the painting trying to do like bump into the walls and then they played they were what you gonna listen to and i was like stan
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00011.flac	really valued it and it was really special for us cause we're both like big fans of each other personally and professionally and and so we always really loved when we got to do stuff so i loved then the last few episodes i got like some huge flattering
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00001.flac	the time period is so enticing and it's so beautiful to watch and there's obviously uh just the time period of the sixties an advertising is so enigmatic and it's not
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00002.flac	um i mean obviously you know as an actor you you do bring elements of yourself to a character that's what you have to go on um at the same time she's very different she's
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00003.flac	um to much more i think i ve than i am less life experience um so she's very different but at the same time it
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00004.flac	its a big question um i think that you know that's a question that's been asked many times over the past five
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00005.flac	there are similarities and differences and things that have improved in things that have not improved and obviously we've come a long way in many ways um that has been very beneficial to women and i think that we've lost things in other ways
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00006.flac	that sense of mystery about women the way that they dress you know that sort of gone
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00007.flac	and lucky to play it um and then you know as far as how
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00008.flac	you know we both try to be good people i uh i think that she's uh relatively honest person and she tries to do the right
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00009.flac	and um the secrets that they already know about each other are
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00010.flac	gosh uh favorite commercial i love apple and i think apple's pretty great um they
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00011.flac	it is very different from now um it it's a world that i never thought i would have anything to do with and now i do it just kind of
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00012.flac	yeah absolutely that's i mean the thing is you're in people's homes and it's funny when people come up to me i find they they'll say that to me they say
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00013.flac	and i understand it's you're in their home every week and um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00001.flac	perfect kind of moment where this pilot came along and i and i was in new york at the time i was cast out of new york and everybody was buzzing about this show mad men and then this other show which
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00002.flac	and um i said i want work with that man and i met mum i just was like i wanna work with him
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00003.flac	you could see that in his face and you could see that in his eyes even just in the audition and um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00004.flac	i loved the role and i felt like the the what i did with the role in that audition what i did who peggy was in that audition was the same person that he wrote so i just felt like we we really clicked
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00005.flac	she's never been in the big city and um now she's
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00006.flac	and she's been working in a man's world for a few years and i think that for me the best way to describe her is just that journey that everybody
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00007.flac	you know twenty to thirty she grows up and she becomes harder in a lot of ways she gets her heartbroken she
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00008.flac	or not but i hope that she still retains that sense of honesty and sort of positivity and truth that i think that you know she's very
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00009.flac	she just very much believe in whatever she's
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00010.flac	and um i think that she still has that despite the fact that she's like had some
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00011.flac	on having to go from that from
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00012.flac	through these clothes which is what jay does and what any good costume designer does um makes my job so much easier
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00013.flac	pad and played with poets and like turtlenecks and then little like me haven't gotten where so much of them but like pants with
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00014.flac	with the character and through the clothes it's been i mean it makes my job so much
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00015.flac	and we put it in and they played the song every time we did it and it was um it was a very special kind of momentum
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00016.flac	if he'd seen us doing it like we used to just slow dance in the middle of the office for no reason just like board you know and since season one and i asked him if he'd seen us do it and he'd said no so it was a weird kind of it was just a a weird coincidence and um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00017.flac	you know made the scripts come first nothing else it is the story that comes first and and that's why we're still here and that's why people still
id10286_0sETQ5nxvf8_00001.flac	and i just find that fascinating so i go in i kind of make up careers or like stories to tell the over drivers so i totally just like them and i got in the bar like the other day and the guy was you know who's talking about his kids and like his marital problems and he's like will you have kids don't you and i was like yeah i have two kids like a boy
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00001.flac	i 'm a soft more this year so um and i went my freshman year which was like really
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00002.flac	um she comes with me on the same lady and um when i'm when i'm filming and we have to do all the work and all the tests and everything and send it back the day that it's do for everyone else so it's like i have to just you have to keep up because then when you come home from you know your movie you if you're not if you don't keep up you're like lost
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00003.flac	starting how uh when i was a little like i had like the best teachers for science so they may be the kind of made me like it more but now doing chemistry this year and then i have physics next year which i hope i still like it after that
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00004.flac	i mean i would say that i mean it always has been kind of like a celebrity
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00001.flac	the box trolls well um the box trolls they're little creatures that live
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00002.flac	me myself doesn't really matter it's all about the way i sound so um i just i had to remember that and like get used to uncomfortable that you know it doesn't matter about the emotion and your eyes you know you have to betray the emotions that would be in your eyes and your voice you have to just get those layers into the way you talk which at first i was
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00003.flac	it was amazing cause i obviously wasn't i mean i did visit portland oregon were they
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00004.flac	i like to say that i'm not gonna move him but then maybe like just a dissatisfying but like i didn't get to
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00005.flac	but we were i didn't get to meet him at common cause when we went so i met him then he doesn't sound anything like
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00006.flac	um we did a session together and with sick uh we did a session together which was nice as you know it was also kind of like you want other actors there
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00007.flac	um we did when we talked when we did the scene about talking about the fathers um me and i did that case it's kind of more like an emotional not not an action
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00008.flac	you have to see the box trolls because it's extremely clever and it's unlike anything you've seen before
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00009.flac	well obviously these little guys are definitely judged by kind of their name and the way they
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00010.flac	hey're very scared and um and in order for them to show people who they truly are they have to overcome their fear and they have to stop being
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00011.flac	is an orphan in a way so he um he's trying to figure out you know what what is a family you know what what does it supposed to be and oh yeah we have a good talk about kind of that you know father's always supposed to be there for you no matter what
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00012.flac	also in a fish who is one of the box trolls is like a father um even though you know he doesn't really fit you wouldn't think of him as a father because he's a little box trolley
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00013.flac	really fit the the norm but he he treats eg like um like a fatherly figure so even though they're not related he still treats him that way and so he's like
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00014.flac	well it's all hand made so when you watch it and i feel like you
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00015.flac	you can see the heart like and you can just tell that like fingers molded all of this and it
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00016.flac	it's something i mean you don't you obviously don't see them doing it but it you can tell you know it set apart that it's just it's not just a computer it's made from
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00001.flac	without reading the script or anything i i went in and i met with um rob linda and joy
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00002.flac	um from that first meeting they they told me about the story and
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00003.flac	a disney princess and um and from that meeting we just we got along so well and um they were sold
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00004.flac	then they they gave me the script after that meeting and i went home and read it right
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00005.flac	it's the classic story of you know sleeping beauty is so much more information so you get to
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00006.flac	you get to know why things happen and why you know maleficent becomes so evil and sort of the steps that it takes because you know people aren't just evil just because you know there has to be a case and and you and in our film you get to see sort of what that cause
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00007.flac	sort of bring the essence of her and i know like when you see pictures of sort of the way she stands with their hands and i was just sort of taking it all in and before the movie before we started filming this movie i watch them
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00008.flac	a movie again just just sort of see if i could pick up on any little mannerisms that she did
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00009.flac	so in the forest and sort of brought those little princess elements but you know also wanted to make
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00010.flac	um you know have those elements but also make her a real person not just a just an animated character
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00011.flac	the faces and they're they're my ants as well so and when you get to see them
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00012.flac	big they're tiny and then um when they become you know the human form when they have to take care of baby arora you know they grow
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00013.flac	they have to be like peasant women i don't think they enjoy very much they they like their wings and their funny costumes
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00014.flac	and you know with the horns and the intensity and all and all that and we definitely have that
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00015.flac	maliphant bird sort of her pet bird and she gets we get in our film we get to see him as a man as well because she turns
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00016.flac	turns into a man and that um and when i meet and when i'm a little i i i play with the bird i do see the bird i pet you know and i have a pretty bird is what i call him and uh and then when i get older i get to see see him in
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00017.flac	to see his character from when he's young and sort of it's a journey for him as much as as much as it is for maleficent in a way so you get to sort of see why he becomes so evil and why she becomes you know so evil so they both have her
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00018.flac	that christ sees um after that i sort of follows a rare around um while a rose growing up so you get to see me sort of in different stages as you know young a toddler and then sort of eight years old and then you finally see me sort of as a teenager and maliphant is sort of there hiding away every in every step of this
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00001.flac	this is different and um and i and i like i like
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00003.flac	and so once you hear that i'm like oh i hope i get to do that and then he wanted to meet with me and and
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00004.flac	the the story of it and what you know what it really was about about these beauty obsessed women and um i was so allinson
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00005.flac	well the way that um nick works was very different from how i had worked before it was extremely close and we were going off instincts the whole time we would we would change things along the way and he allowed me i'd never felt um this much freedom on a set he kind of he allowed me to put myself
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00006.flac	views or even as being a teenager myself i was sixteen my character was sixteen so there would be a lot of things where i'd be like nick she would never say this or you know she would never wear
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00007.flac	freedom it was um it was a strange but amazing feeling to work that
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00008.flac	say this you know she would never wear this and he's like okay we will change it will change so um yeah i never felt that freedom it was um it was a strange but amazing feeling to work that way and we filmed in sequence in chronological order so that was very helpful cause she does you know um
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00009.flac	i related kind of one thing was that she's you know she's from a small town and moves to a big city and we made her from georgia which is where i'm from and moved to la so i understood
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00010.flac	seeing a big city and in fresh eyes and and also being the youngest person around because i mean i started acting
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00011.flac	when i was young so i know how it feels to be
id10286_FP4TghS5_UQ_00001.flac	the pronoun he him you know so um we we wanted to talk about that but it's nice that our film i think our film is unique in that way where it's they've been living with him for a very long time now but then it's not
id10286_FP4TghS5_UQ_00002.flac	starts where he wants to take the next step and and get the testosterone and um
id10286_FP4TghS5_UQ_00003.flac	you know i'm not playing a female so um that was interesting to feel a lot of female energy but i wasn't contributing to it
id10286_J37FfHHefdc_00001.flac	well we get the scene your patio which is a huge deal because um if you're not a scene if you're not a senior you're not allowed to be on it as an underclassmen so now we can like kick off all the freshmen and kick off all the years be like
id10286_J37FfHHefdc_00002.flac	line on all the doors and zip tied all the locker shut and stolen
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00001.flac	i was getting accepted into the like a family so that was nice she has her coraline dall and now i have my wine so it's very cool but i was really familiar with their stop motion and you know in their movies cause i felt like i grew up with it kind of cause my sister for like seven or eight years she was voicing coraline and i did get to go to portland and visit the um the studios with her so it
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00002.flac	um and in their world so i i knew i was familiar with it i think they kind of they asked me to do this cause they they already knew
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00003.flac	it so i love the the the teenage like the girl in it uh yeah and i i i did get to see when i went to the box trolls um uh when i went to the i went up to portland and saw the set there and then i saw paranorman like some of the deals they have sitting out and the girl is just so funny she has her fingernails are painted pink and she has like a pink track suit this tiny i'm like and it's a real terms
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00004.flac	i i i feel like i've never played um someone like her before cause she definitely kind of a break
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00005.flac	you know like she's she's not someone that you you kind of wanna dislike her but then you don't
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00006.flac	feel you know it's similar because i still prepare in the same way as i still imagine that i'm this person
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00007.flac	and and work with the script and feel like i'm i'm still becoming a character but then it's very different cause you don't have your face to rely on you don't have your eyes to kind of show that emotion and every all the layers have to be depicted in the way you sound which at first was definitely like a challenge for me cause i was i felt like i was like really acting with you like with my face like you don't have to do that
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00008.flac	just make sure that it comes out and your voice betrays the emotion so then you get more comfortable with it but that was that
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00009.flac	i because i like to play that game like when i watch animated films like trying to guess you know this lot and like i think we're gonna stump a lot of people with this one they're going in
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00010.flac	just seeing how small these things are and realizing that every single thing you see on screen is handmade by the oddest materials and they're all have all these mechanics underneath them
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00011.flac	can snarl and like everything um and everything
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00012.flac	is done by a human touch and i and you can really tell that like there's a lot of heart that goes into it i think like five seconds takes two weeks to do
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00001.flac	they do movies that they're not just like oh or you know funny for kids like whatever they like have like meaning to them and um they're also they're very
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00002.flac	i did my neighbor totoro with maybe i was younger but i did uh my nor too with my sister not
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00003.flac	and and that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that long cause it was like as first a stop motion that they had
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00004.flac	what they did so then later when like just a couple years ago and they asked me to do box trolls i was
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00005.flac	and and no one i i like when like new creatures
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00006.flac	um i would with my sister i guess i was kind of trying to get attention but it never worked cause i i did every single year but i would like pretend that like i fell
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00001.flac	like completely i was in shock cause i loved all houses when i when i was very young man
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00002.flac	and it was just like miniatures everywhere uh and
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00003.flac	blew my mind that there were people like out there that that did this it was just
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00004.flac	yes because i knew everyone and i was just i loved the boxtel script and i loved
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00005.flac	i think she's kind of like an unexpected maybe a character for me to play just cause i don't know he never played anyone like her before she has like this kind of brady element and she's like slightly spoiled um but i liked how
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00006.flac	side but then on the inside she's like loves all these like little really grotesque
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00007.flac	and um and and and that was fun to to just be kind
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00008.flac	first in the audience sees her they might not like her so much she's a little study but um but afterwards like he she wins you over and you realize kind of what she is and she has a sensitive side and she's just trying to help eggs and get the attention from her dad that she that she wants and yeah she's a very very
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00009.flac	make sure that it's right also i mean with being with other english actors in the film
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00010.flac	a job so i mean i did have a dialect coach that was with me and um she was on set
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00011.flac	but um with me in there and she would you know perfect little words and get it right and we wanted to make i think that winnie's was a little more posture than i had ever done cause you know she's she's a high a lead of the cheese bridge
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00012.flac	so i mean i i think so whenever it happens i don't know when we're gonna um film it but when they
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00013.flac	well i've never read it before so i'll do i'll do it i'll do all the research i need
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00001.flac	such a close bond i've never really had that with the director being so collaborative it was like i would show up in the mornings and
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00002.flac	um and that was just extraordinary to have and his style and all of his choices and you know the the shots it was just so specific and everything meant something was so detail and i was like doing and so artistic like a photograph was in photography
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00003.flac	so mixing that with you know the the fashion world and and these women is just an ex it's an extraordinary thing and i think the film you know having all those very complex themes it
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00004.flac	its all with girls so um and and it's not i feel like a lot
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00005.flac	crazy so people are just looking at the faults image that's not perfect then they see a real human being they're like oh you're not like what you're looking
id10286_a3QzK5pWpI4_00001.flac	no i'm not uh but yeah she's five four and i'm about five six and a half five
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00001.flac	a tomorrow which um it's very scary for me to think about as well and i think that
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00002.flac	one person cause they've grown up together their whole lives spent every day with one
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00003.flac	for me it was all the different emotions that ginger gets to go through and i thought it would be
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00004.flac	completely perfect i mean after reading the script the script is perfect and and sales
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00005.flac	they're they're completely different cause mine was in the six season than hers was more modern and in a different area so they're completely different he she
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00006.flac	accent something different i'd never done an accent before um it was definitely a little nervous about it just because it's something new but um we um before we started shooting
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00007.flac	the dial which i didn't want a song on set because you know she wants to think more about the scenes and the characters and and have the dialect sort of be already there and you know one less thing to worry about which it was nice to have it sort of
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00008.flac	i think that it was so exciting to see so many different types of people in one film
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00009.flac	it totally different personalities but they all sort of they were together
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00001.flac	in new york um but she'll come home to la and we spent it together
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00002.flac	and uh decorated and every year i give everyone ornament and my family so i have like a special
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00003.flac	accurate and beautiful and even the costumes i got to wear some really beautiful costumes and a costume designer down to like the underwear and socks all from
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00004.flac	chris cooper in the movie he's my father um he's the chief of police in florida and i you kind of see her start when she's she's younger and that she wants to go to hollywood to become a star but she doesn't quite make it there and falls into a kind of a dark place and comes back and is born
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00005.flac	and becomes an evangelist preacher during the prohibition and so she's speaking against alcohol and drugs and gambling which is bad form
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00006.flac	he's in the scene with you you don't feel like he's taking you are directing you
id10286_iH0jGPqp3Hc_00001.flac	do we need where is my character going and it kinda just relied on instincts and in the mornings i would show up and he'd be like so what are you what are you feeling today like what you wanna do and i'm like god like
id10286_iH0jGPqp3Hc_00002.flac	we made her come from like a small town go to a big city which is what is
id10286_iH0jGPqp3Hc_00003.flac	look skinnier or make there's it's like crazy so people are just looking at this false image that's not perfect then they see a real human being they're like oh you're not like what you're looking at it it's fake so it's kind
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00001.flac	ben is this gonna you know there's a script that he's gonna direct and that he wrote you're and he's gonna star and you're like alright yes like whatever
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00002.flac	um great um but i of course i read the script and really you the way that it's written
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00003.flac	the action sequences kind of playing out and it's so many different things going on in time periods and um and obviously loretta she really you know stuck out to me and uh and after reading i really was like i hope i hope i get the people
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00004.flac	so i had to meet with ben but yeah it was really a great
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00005.flac	so well and how to kind of create the best environment too
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00006.flac	facilitate your best performance and to me and to want to uh just let everyone be creative and
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00007.flac	and he's just so kind of giving in that way and um and and then as a director it's i can't be like his organization in his mind you know to have to to switch and switch but when you're in
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00008.flac	he is my first day on set my first scene was the scene with it but with
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00009.flac	and it was like it's a very intense after i've like come back from hollywood and and
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00010.flac	and because i think for a while she didn't really get to face her demons like she should have cause she was very
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00011.flac	busy kind of up in the cloud saying these words that she kind of i think believed in the beginning but started to start to trail off and so she didn't really get to to face all those like she should have maybe it would have worked up at her
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00012.flac	there's uh there there's a woman uh my simple person uh which you kind of can we based a lot of kind of loretta's look off of her her white and the big jule crosses um and things and there was uh yeah there was you two videos that i had watched actually it was like this amazing video of her
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00001.flac	in the movie is sort of the lonely more doesn't really have anything to do with his life and then cleo sort it comes in and she
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00002.flac	you know taking care of him she's making him breakfast and things like that she's being like the mom to him in a way and um but yeah she's just a normal eleven year old girl i was eleven when i shot in um so i could relate to her a lot thinking
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00003.flac	played um rock band a lot with steven cause we did a lot of rehearsals and um
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00004.flac	i think i got like uneasy i got like a ninety seven or something it was not
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00005.flac	but both of us really had to be like we play it all the time so we sort of taught us how to do the whole thing and yet we were jellous of him because he was so
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00006.flac	eating it helps with the balance in posture but um i fell a lot when i was training i trained for about
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00007.flac	like a huge deal now and it got so big it was sort of not even
id10286_lJQTN_wK9vA_00001.flac	i always it's funny because when we were filming it it was all green screen and there wasn't trains flying above you it wasn't like that it also seeing it for the first time with everything put together it was crazy i was screaming you know it i couldn't believe it looked like that and it
id10286_lJQTN_wK9vA_00002.flac	it was exactly like it was on screen really we had the best time together and we laughed so much we just all of them were so cool and i was the youngest one i was twelve
id10286_lJQTN_wK9vA_00003.flac	that that's what he used to film with when he was a kid with all his friends he was like one of
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00001.flac	we try to perfect it so i wouldn't be you know when we started filming that was just already there so i wouldn't be thinking about that because the audience can definitely tell that you're thinking about that one
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00002.flac	she we did our accents were different cause mine was in the six season hearts more
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00003.flac	each other tips but um hers was i thought was impeccable she did such
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00004.flac	i did a little bit but i also i sadly grew up in that time so from that i sort of picked her about what it was like and sort of growing up in the time of how it was so scary
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00001.flac	the original animated version sleeping beauty in that when she's very
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00002.flac	yeah everything that you think a princess is a kind of all those characteristics she she definitely
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00003.flac	but in ours she still is that way and she loves everyone and um it's very open and and she's not
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00004.flac	munificent she's like everyone's normally so scared of me but arora you know she hasn't learned
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00005.flac	she doesn't learn to be scared of things that um look odd or you know creatures that have horns and um and it's nice for or and this when she has more depth and obviously there a lot of secrets um there that that are kept from her um you know she thinks both of her parents are dead and she lives kind of very isolated in this cottage with her three fairy antis and um so she doesn't really know much about you know outside of the
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00006.flac	and it's nice that i could bring you know more layers to her and um and and and have more strength than just kind of the pretty pretty princess you know that's in in the
id10286_pqJw3UuOuCY_00001.flac	but asner palm dog and i also have
id10286_pqJw3UuOuCY_00002.flac	go to classes so i always have to throw it up but mostly i just like i twist it like
id10286_rPKjog9010U_00001.flac	like a supermodel and so she would uh she would inform
id10286_yAe_ZhyWdnI_00001.flac	and i i kinda had one i well last year um the boy who asked me um he was a near sob
id10286_yAe_ZhyWdnI_00002.flac	with your car so he called me at school one day and um he was like i got in a car accident come down to my car and i'm like oh god like i go into panic mode i'm like running down
id10286_yAe_ZhyWdnI_00003.flac	and uh and then he was in the front seat and he was like can you look in the back trunk um to get a toolbox and so
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00001.flac	only differences her knees were pulled up to her chest
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00002.flac	redecorating my house i'm always being created by find that
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00003.flac	ten williams and his beautiful writing is wonderful
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00004.flac	in all its forms if i'm not doing a play or a picture i'm a photographing or i'm writing
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00005.flac	ted williams and his beautiful writing is wonderful
id10287_4SgMBa9MUvc_00001.flac	have old friends that i rely on that are part of my life and have been for
id10287_4SgMBa9MUvc_00002.flac	um and it's about uh people relating in and trying to overcome
id10287_4oOmqI1myzY_00001.flac	we haven't started yet i mean we're just beginning to talk about casting i was offered the part
id10287_4oOmqI1myzY_00002.flac	then as i was reading it i started in visioning scenes um and then i told the writer and the producer about the scenes i was envisioning and they liked it and then i said well why don't i direct it and
id10287_8vC0LQMqy8Y_00001.flac	filming is doesn't live here anymore and the exercise opened in two so so and it was around my birthday so i throw a party for the cast and crew of less
id10287_8vC0LQMqy8Y_00002.flac	and i got up and followed her and she got to the top of the rap of the land she fainted and i went over to help her and uh
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00001.flac	and uh i remember one morning i left town
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00002.flac	the first one i left town because i was so excited about it i thought i really must come down so i i made myself take a drive and not
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00003.flac	when i got home i had a case of flowers all over my doorstep it was
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00004.flac	most of the times that i was nominated i was working and between so uh i i i didn't dwell on
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00005.flac	uh but it's hard not to it kind of takes over your mind for
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00006.flac	well i wasn't there i was on broadway in the same time next year
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00007.flac	well they would let me off that but i didn't think it was fair cause people waited so long they got tickets sometimes three or four months they had a time
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00008.flac	it was fun um we were shooting in pittsburg and i liked pitsburg very much and
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00009.flac	wonderful person to work with and the rest of the cast two i love my daughter julia more she said i think new exciting a beautiful man
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00010.flac	now it's a movie about relationships and there are too many of those around
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00011.flac	and i'm i'm glad to see that i got mad and i hope
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00012.flac	i still get letters it wasn't the most successful movie i did but i still get
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00013.flac	um use it in their workshops and um on healing and on dying and a lot of people had told me that they were with their parents when they died because of having seen the movie and i think it's changed people's attitude that people have been exposed to it a lot about about death
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00014.flac	um and i used to play always good mothers lately i've been playing bad mothers and
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00015.flac	you know there are a lot of really wonderful actresses uh who are
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00016.flac	um because there are the roles for them so i don't think there's a lot
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00017.flac	you know it's not just that they're not running the parts i think it's a reflection of our culture that
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00018.flac	when i made alice doesn't live here anymore in nineteen seventy four there weren't any films being made from a woman's point of view was a kind of watershed picture and i think that's changed
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00019.flac	actresses have taken it upon themselves to make their own work
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00020.flac	when you work in a film where you don't have much to do it's that's when you don't really know what to do with yourself you know when you have a a story where there's a lot happening and there's a lot to work on that's when it becomes very challenging
id10287_MHoaMi5hKkE_00001.flac	we are all sworn to secrecy we can't talk about it it's a space travel i think i can say that if it's not
id10287_MHoaMi5hKkE_00002.flac	yeah he's wonderful um there a lot of actors
id10287_MHoaMi5hKkE_00003.flac	i think so i haven't seen it but i saw math and i said i still in the film because at such a small part could be he said you're in it i've seen it it's great it's
id10287_RfDogGJ-UnM_00001.flac	i think i've been very good about getting my um goals in mind what i want
id10287_RfDogGJ-UnM_00002.flac	um but i don't think i've ever been called on really sacrifice
id10287_V0ubcXO71Sg_00001.flac	so i get to come and visit with her my brother used to live nearby so i came
id10287_V0ubcXO71Sg_00002.flac	to see him so i feel very at home here and then i hear that it's the oldest film festival i didn't know that in there
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00001.flac	i had no idea that it was as popular as it yes i mean only since this season opened last week have i been getting reactions like i've never gotten for anything i've ever done in my career i've mean i can't walk my dog without
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00002.flac	it just it's a hugely popular show and and the people
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00003.flac	no i i i did do one i'll see
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00004.flac	because i have to watch so many shows for voting um but i did watch a few of these shows and liked it very much but i had no idea that it was what it is to people which is
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00005.flac	now though i have a script called bathing so that i just love and i wanna act and direct that's a new challenge in looking poet to and you know in the process of raising money which is the hardest thing i've ever
id10287_nJkteFlsqPk_00001.flac	that she felt inside that she needed to express to test
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00001.flac	the priests who were working in the film were very active on the set um blessing the set and us and um we were
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00002.flac	and uh they're both really wonderful films um and my television series will be
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00003.flac	to that life and i'm just having the best time i've ever had in my career going to work every day and having a study
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00004.flac	it's nice to come back to television with such a good writing and
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00001.flac	an experience on its own we saw the film for the first time in its entirety
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00002.flac	there fans of scott pilgrim and that just was so overwhelming that we got to sit there together as a cast and kind of experience it for the first time in that environment you know because you're there with people who are really passionate about the project and then
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00003.flac	they wanted it to begin and they were and it was it was the reception was was amazing they loved it they laughed all the right parts
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00004.flac	it got some point we were both comfortable with our weapons and i think that was was most important is that we were we we didn't feel like we were holding for objects in our hands and
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00005.flac	was really important and um to us being able to start to deliver them
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00006.flac	and that with the help of the amazing stunt team we just
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00007.flac	yeah i i would she's mine because you know i think it's really cool that she's a girl drummer and she's just kind of sitting there she observes everything and she's just
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00008.flac	um and i think that's just cool because you know i guess it's sort of in a way opposite of ives
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00009.flac	cause she's just so involved with everything that and i sort of she sits back and kind just take it i think that
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00010.flac	yeah well i mean even right going right into shooting i hadn't
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00011.flac	the fit and he was still you know going through that
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00012.flac	and then i think it was during a production we got to read that and then this book just
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00013.flac	it got some point we were both comfortable with our weapons and i think that was was most important is that we were we we didn't feel like we were holding for objects in our hands and
id10288_CGFR9WP0Rno_00001.flac	pilgrim it reminds me a lot about the sort of john hue films um in a way that the sort of comcast coming of age story and i think that's what's really great about sport
id10288_DyK7j3QIO9c_00001.flac	fun about being able to play notes that you we can just i could just start a lot lot loose and allow myself to purely and
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00001.flac	you know like it's a show that's fun but it's also
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00002.flac	who she was and u stand up for herself and to really know what it is that she wanted in her
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00003.flac	written a lovely note to a sofa or card so that was really sweet and i know
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00004.flac	i wanted to see growing up that i never really got to see grace the screens um someone who
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00005.flac	different life at home i mean she's chinese american and uh it's
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00006.flac	the cards um the writers the the entire team on u behind the scenes on the show are have been really great
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00007.flac	you know it happens to everyone and that's where when everything is sort of a big
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00008.flac	and we're not trying to be sex in the city but again we do have a lot of the
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00009.flac	lot of them worked also on the sex in the city so um we do have the support of that and and them putting in their input to writing
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00001.flac	it's it's it's been a blast just working on the show um it's essentially a prequel to sex in the city all the same creators on board kanas bush wrote the wrote the book and now it's a tv show and we're really excited about it it's essentially carry bradshaw in her formative years so it
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00002.flac	a mouse and i ask about that and she was just very nonchalant about it it was just one of those things that kind of stuck she had a friend and they kind of started calling her mouse for some reason and so i i think it's sort of the same thing i mean with with uh with mouse into the car dire she's got this sort of um way of kind of figuring things out like she plans everything out and she like gathers in
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00003.flac	a mouse in a way so and she gets to where all these were like really fun mouse pins um on all of her outfit so she has a different mouse pint for every outfit so that's also a reason why that she has a nickname but she's also um carries loyal supportive friend and uh she's pragmatic and also she's got her life sort of planned out
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00004.flac	realizes along the way that that's not exactly the best way to of your life so
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00005.flac	in life and life would be so bland without romance you know it's love is what we need it's what we hate but also
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00006.flac	sex in the city left such a legacy you know and i hope that we can bring on the same fans but also nourish and developed new fans for this show because it's also geared towards a younger demographic but it's also taking a great character a woman who was just so confident and and unique and okay and had a great sense of self and waste
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00001.flac	major in film and television um and kind of learned the business side of it and worked on
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00002.flac	and um and then after i finished school that's when i was like okay now it's my time to really kind of
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00003.flac	one and put it on a screen how do you share it with the world um and that to me was always fascinating so um after i finished school i finished university i decided to just i actually quit all my jobs and my parents are always crazy because i had a job offer to after school and i was i i was like no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do it they're like what buttons
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00004.flac	like they just could fathom the fact that i didn't want to be working but i was like but i am working i am auditioning
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00005.flac	so i mean i think it's it's um kind of hard for people too
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00006.flac	i understand at first but i mean for me it was something i really needed to
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00007.flac	and understand at first but i mean for me it was something i really needed to pursue
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00008.flac	she just called me up and said um there's just a really great role you should go out for so i put myself on tape at first um i didn't have too much time to kind of check
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00009.flac	um what proportion let you know what they kind of put out there it's just amazing and i think
id10288_UbApEUoPvzY_00001.flac	um it's a film but at the same time i think it's a piece of art because there's just so much coming at you visually it's
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00001.flac	you know sort of this uninhibited girl she's just so much fun and full of energy and and she's just got this genuine love of life and so that was what initially attracted me to her and then after i i remember because that's how when i first auditioned for her um for the role that's kind of the side of notes that i had to show and then when i looked
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00002.flac	i just thought you know wow she's really cool cause she's got so many sides to her and you get to really start to see her growth and and so i thought that was
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00003.flac	shooting that that you know that time we were shooting that set it was fun because we got to sort of do the concerts
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00004.flac	we could help but keep laughing so i i just remember like it was it took us so
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00005.flac	i think it was really important for all of us to to read the series before getting into the shooting part of it because um we we tried to say so you know true to right
id10288_mMHfMIiIQP0_00001.flac	just about his own caribbean is not one but three times three times members of parliament proposed
id10288_owPgCDQ_URk_00001.flac	her first time going through it you know i mean so you're getting the purest most uninhibited feelings ever being shown to you and and i think that's what makes her differen
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00001.flac	strict and he'd like he'd like take me and be like to master it so by the time you get here i want him to the first one
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00002.flac	yeah absolutely you know i've been i've been writing some scripts for the past couple years and
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00003.flac	you know the movie i kinda wanna make i wrote this script called a shack and it's just like this movie takes place in one location and i just thought i would be fun to make for like no money with some friends you know get a you get to make a movie before you make a movie in
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00004.flac	you know you can make something on a super super low budget small camera with you
id10290_1wx7tV3CrD0_00001.flac	i just remember really being struck by the sense of adventure and like wanting
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00001.flac	and you're like i didn't really feel like i got to know that period that well but one of the joys about working with angle is this his beautiful mind and his kind of obsession with every little facet of the detail of the period really rubs off on everyone else and you really find yourself learning a lot more about it there
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00002.flac	and then you ever thought you would and that was something that that happened with me and i found myself really um you know consuming
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00003.flac	material that he would give me you know a lot of the different i mean he sent me probably
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00004.flac	the heath ledger had and brokeback mountain that i really liked and that was a performance that i hang it also directed so there was some there was some of that you know billy's not a gay character but there was there was something about the kind of internal conflict
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00005.flac	the deer hunter where i was like oh that's a great moment that i maybe billy could
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00006.flac	it's the sound of the gun that like puts you in that state it's hard to it's hard to think that without actually knowing what it
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00007.flac	those scenes to kind of have that snap quick aware in this reaction cause before i i remember i tried to in rehearsal before i
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00008.flac	those little subtleties that maybe a lot of the people in the audience when they watch if there's if it's not there they don't consciously know but what is so as part of his genius is filling in all
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00009.flac	little question marks to where when people watch it it just has this feeling of kind of honesty and perfection and truth
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00010.flac	is obsessed with their work it just shows you know a discipline and a passion and a rigor that is only beneficial in my
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00011.flac	if not more conversation just about what kind of shoes billy should wear and how
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00012.flac	you know that's just an example of the kinds of details that we would talk about you know and and we would have hours just talking about what kind of what kind of person billy was we would create whole stories in our minds about who billy was and what did happen to him and why he feels a certain way and
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00013.flac	i just i loved it i mean because i'm very similar in the sense that i love to obsess about my character when i work on
id10290_BTnbKeUJ5r8_00001.flac	process when it was actually really really spare i think kinda paul and i were both really prepared and ready to go but i i
id10290_BTnbKeUJ5r8_00002.flac	are we knew the material enough to where we could perform the scenes but they still had like a fresh just kinda just
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00001.flac	exactly the tone of the scenes cause uh you wanna capture that naturalism where people watch and they're like oh i believe these characters i believe these are real people i like these guys but at the same time you know uh you wanna be
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00002.flac	and stuff like that and sometimes there's moments where it goes against being a hundred percent not
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00003.flac	an exciting kind of thriller experience you know it's like if action and
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00004.flac	just the setting of moscow and and this kind of different visual language with the three that people haven't normally scene and i think it's gonna also be pretty scary you know i think
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00005.flac	you know the best elements of of jaws and that kind of where where is this creature a where is this thing i hope we can bring uh some of that to the screen and i think that that will all make up for a pretty good time
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00006.flac	they told me that olivia was already attached and that was definitely a really big
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00007.flac	influence on me wanting to do the film i'd really like uh a lot of her performances and i thought she was just a
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00008.flac	i had seen her in a couple in a seen her in a play with christine a really good
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00009.flac	north and um and i really liked your performance there and i like her in juno
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00010.flac	i just thought it would be um it'd be pretty fun to to work with an actor who's never really made a movie like this
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00011.flac	that way and she's been having a really interesting time and just kind of adapting to this like
id10290_FgJsZ26_AXU_00001.flac	i i i don't know why it works but i know when i feel like it's not working
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00001.flac	film and the opportunity to get to work with him he's made so many classic films over the years and
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00002.flac	he's just uh not only is he a great director but he's just a hilarious wonderfully
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00003.flac	i don't think i've ever played a character that was probably as a moral and a certainty
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00004.flac	but at the same time it sounds really dark but there's also you know this dark humor to it
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00005.flac	i think that everybody's got you know there they're light sides and their dark sides and they're good days and they're bad days so you know it's kind of examining the text and
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00006.flac	you know a version of it and uh studying that part you know there's so much of that that moral ambiguity and the kind of uh you know he's so conflicted about whether or not
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00007.flac	people and who love and who he's not love and i think that that that really helped me when it came
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00008.flac	you know a lot of the guys i grew up with um you know i lived in um topanga
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00009.flac	uh which is kind of kind of a rural community and you know there was times where i remember uh you know
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00010.flac	once you are kind of you know in that environment for long enough you know the trailer becomes its own
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00011.flac	there is a lot of uh you know new wants to it and and there is the highest
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00012.flac	i had worked with um uh into the wild and the character i portray in the film christma calais had donated his life savings before he went on this kind exits that he did to oxfam america the oxford famine relief at a humanitarian aid organization and they had asked me when the film came out if i had be interested in going
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00013.flac	to a part of the world in this case it was the democratic republic of congo and they show you the programs that they have you know with with you know the water you know clean water and
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00014.flac	well and uh you know food distribution and and um you know support for rape victims and some of the rape clinics that they have out there and then when you come back and uh hopefully uh you know you can spread the word about what they do and and they really do a lot of reasons
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00015.flac	the the freedoms they have the luxuries they have everything you everything you have that you take for granted take tap water for granted you know i i was staying in you know one of the nicest hotels in the congo and and barely had running water when i was there you know and and then we went to another part and i i talked to a guy who was
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00016.flac	just appreciate everything you have and and realize that a lot of people have it a lot worse off and that was what if
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00017.flac	you know but you can see that anywhere though you know you can see that on the corner there's homeless people
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00018.flac	cause he was there you know that would be a good title the guy who talks about it cause her
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00019.flac	me that wants to engage in that way um you know and do what i can you know son pen has a um a relief organization that help
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00020.flac	jo and he and i went i he asked me to go to haiti last year and uh may and i went to head for twelve days and stayed at a camp that he's working with and you know there's fifty five thousand people that are in this camp that jar is one of the leading kind of

id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00003.flac	a huge robotic arm that can like you sit on it and there's like a set and it just thrashes you around and could spin you around and it mirrors the movement of a car and it's all on a green screen background and it's not and it gives you whip
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00004.flac	that looks real i mean the effects in this movie i've got
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00005.flac	they would show me some artwork may be like okay this is what's gonna happen
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00006.flac	driver all my friends were laughing when i got the part cause they all know me is like the
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00007.flac	it was like the most amazing actor you could ever be around i mean you're just so riveted by his every movement
id10290_VYk_DxNl_T8_00001.flac	uh you know i i was i felt that i wanted to kinda get males i wanted to be true to who he was as a person you didn't wanna just throw the character out of the window and do my own interpretation or anything
id10290_VYk_DxNl_T8_00002.flac	kind of touches the pan as something that exists within us all you know that that yearning for
id10290_VYk_DxNl_T8_00003.flac	into the wild was such a long hard shoot that i think i just went into speed racer uh with
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00001.flac	the story and it just um really struck a chord with me and it seemed like a character that i never really played you know i wasn't used to playing a tough guy ever
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00002.flac	and it was very complicated uh psychologically you know i was trying to let on but not too
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00003.flac	of my favorite scenes uh it ended up being that way but i remember there was like one of the first takes a they were like action and i just like
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00004.flac	that it gets people a lot more self conscious about them
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00001.flac	he was like well let's see how about you wanna do this i'm not giving you the role you train at this procamps that i selected proclaim for all six days a week at six am you
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00002.flac	five or six hours of training day which is insane and
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00003.flac	mars is a very intelligent man and a very detailed oriented person and he wanted nothing less than absolutes
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00004.flac	it's an incredible story and a great monument to uh men and women in uniform and people who serve and people who are going to make those sacrifices and they should be appreciated they shouldn't get lost and that's twenty four seven new scale that we have these days where it's like you hear about something about on the news and two days later it's not even in your mind
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00005.flac	this is a chance to really appreciate a really special group of people that have made some huge sacrifices for
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00006.flac	he's a great confidence so much confidence he's a great man
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00007.flac	a kind intelligent person who i really really admired
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00008.flac	he knows how he knew how to navigate the relationships with all the
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00009.flac	fallen in a really genuine respectful way where people didn't feel like no one was being short changed or taken advantage of or anything like that they they really supported pet and they got behind
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00010.flac	move in and they like it so it's like kinda like mission accomplished a little bit we sort of feel cause i know for
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00011.flac	the people he wanted to like the movie he told me that before we've been shot he said that's all the matters
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00001.flac	you know i tried to just learn as much as i could about him you know through the family i gotta meet with walt and billy means christmas
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00002.flac	you know try to read a lot of the philosophy that chris was reading at the time you know there's walden by
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00003.flac	and and uh you know said pomes by ralph waldo emerson so there was that kind of philosophical background and and uh the call of the wild by jack london was really
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00004.flac	and uh that wanderlust that exists within us all that i feel as one of the big
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00005.flac	to the to the book and and now the film you know if michael had had you know personal problems and just ran off next door and you know built train sets no one would have
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00006.flac	not his clothes his his watch he had a gold watch that he gave to jim alien when jim galion let him off on the stampede trail fourteen years before and in the film jim galion plays himself dropping me off under the same
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00007.flac	came to set and he actually had a gold watch that christmas class had given it to him fourteen years before so
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00008.flac	me um the gold watch cause he thought i should wear it so i had the gold watch
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00009.flac	he just alaska is the biggest challenge on his plate you know
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00010.flac	core survival you know or independent survival that he wanted to test himself to challenge himself on the hardest train that he could find and that to him was
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00011.flac	um well you know i just i just tried to play him for who i thought he was and uh you know if people feel that way they're more than entitled and welcome to feel that way you know there's nothing wrong with feeling like that i don't think uh that's just a perspective on him
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00012.flac	no i don't i don't feel like i uh short changed uh or uh you know gave mcanlis a phonebook phonebook to sit under
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00013.flac	you know to kind of raise him up um i don't think that any of that was going on and we
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00014.flac	make him look better than than he was cause he wouldn't have wanted that this was a guy who had been running his whole life from stuff that he thought was
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00015.flac	make him look better than than he was cause he wouldn't have wanted that this was a guy who had been running his whole life from stuff that he thought was false and now that you know he was
id10290_fVOTAQKIfY4_00001.flac	best in the races and he's supported by his wonderful family uh the racer family
id10290_fVOTAQKIfY4_00002.flac	one kind of the cracker jack new kind of mark on the track racer uh and all the big core calamari up people wanna kinda sign him
id10290_fVOTAQKIfY4_00003.flac	i i'm i'm i'm actually i'm really hyper aware of how dangerous driving is like all the time like
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00001.flac	it was only sixteen days prince avalanche it was just a very fast
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00002.flac	i think that sometimes some of these smaller movies where it's they don't have enough money to have a big action sequences or or necessarily like a lot of plot or a lot of locations
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00003.flac	so that's that's always a benefit for the actors cause you get more more more stuff to play
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00004.flac	benefits to the audience i guess that just depends on what the audience is looking for you know if you're if you wanna have a couple of laughs and a really enjoyable time and see if
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00005.flac	i think that that this this is like the perfect movie for you to see you know obviously if you wanna see like a robot that's probably
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00006.flac	yeah ramping which is when you're practicing your music but you're
id10290_jjzisko126k_00001.flac	you know they they always say that you know when you have a clear mind blowing experience but you always hear that but then of course
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00001.flac	in the twenty twenty episode when i was just a kid when i was about eight years old i saw the the twenty twenty episode about end of the wild in christmas clean it always did always stuck
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00002.flac	he's just a fireball of a guy so to get a call from him as kind
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00003.flac	the scarier than they would seem when you when you actually get up close to
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00004.flac	integrity of the authenticity went on what he whatever he
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00005.flac	so we would go to all those real locations that christmas really went to you know if there's a scene where i'm going down a river naked and ice water i would be naked in a river
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00006.flac	the mentality of the shoot but the whole crew we all really we all bonded as a family we got into it
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00007.flac	you take the risks that the film required but always be cautious
id10290_lKe4gUde-jg_00001.flac	it presses the sounds come out so i hit it and it was literally a guy saying lines i had in the
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00001.flac	defining moment where i felt like music helped me out uh yeah
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00002.flac	the the defining moment was probably when my mom used to sing me nursery rims
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00003.flac	i mean i think that that i mean it's it's kind of a strange answer but i mean
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00004.flac	so when i made the film like i was very i kind of already knew a lot of that hippy culture and a lot of that whole world
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00005.flac	and it was just like a music festival kind of craft and all
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00006.flac	just the novelty of that and a sense but it was also like
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00007.flac	like mine on my crotch and some take but
id10291_0kSotQgmwoI_00001.flac	yes and it stayed with me forever i was five um i was doing bale and my parents were watching and i fell flat on my face it
id10291_3q0vhiAP7i8_00001.flac	to them i was saying like when all the men like have their closes on then they're all dancing you know when they
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00001.flac	an amazing case i actually recently visited a children's hospice um and it really kind of until you see you know first first hand what actually goes on and the incredible people that raise money for these sorts of things it really really kind of hits home how important these
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00002.flac	well as i say it's it's one of those things until you see it at first
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00003.flac	unless you if you don't have that kind of um trouble in your life you don't know how how important it is really until
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00004.flac	its so important it's so important to support this um and yeah these the people that are immortal they they're just incredible people
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00005.flac	total of ratifies um i was taking over a picky lot for a while and she she's now doing the west end and yeah i've just had the most incredible eight weeks

id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00007.flac	yeah i've just had the most incredible at weeks doing that uh yeah so i'm just kind of getting back into the real world now um kind of kind of get rid of my habits and yeah just getting getting back into the real world
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00008.flac	new careers so unbelievably different it's incredible um i'm just so lucky to be working i'm so lucky to be doing kind of all different areas of it um and yeah it's it's so fun it's always fun about it
id10291_4aLg_keiGHw_00009.flac	yeah i've got a film coming out called lies we tell uh which comes out kind of a little bit later the year after the summer i reckon so maybe the beginning of the winter um yeah that is
id10291_7lrVxsJOOZ4_00001.flac	i you know i i haven't been done the materials for a long time now but it's just it's so nice to see it continuing and watching it you know i can now be asked
id10291_7lrVxsJOOZ4_00002.flac	i love it yeah i i love the film i love the first film and i think
id10291_98qWWArcL3Y_00001.flac	my first film um so i was thrown at the deep end really but best way to do it and yeah and i was i was saying earlier that you know that i was i started out as such a huge fan of these people now that of my friends it's like
id10291_98qWWArcL3Y_00002.flac	so happy and it was just believe this is all happening you know but with films it's kind of like there's just
id10291_98qWWArcL3Y_00003.flac	that little bit more excitement and i didn't think i could feel any more excited about her job
id10291_98qWWArcL3Y_00004.flac	well it was like i mean the gags were obviously time down a lot more you know we're in company of um you know very respectable people you know um but it was it was a lovely it was a really it was really nice actually a nice change i always like you know change um yeah it was great and everybody got on so
id10291_98qWWArcL3Y_00005.flac	like the fact that it was a whole mix of ages and the cast cause i'm not used to that i am so yeah it was an
id10291_EX6SP5_i96o_00001.flac	turn down to work with those people again they're just incredible the writers are amazing and yeah hopefully
id10291_EX6SP5_i96o_00002.flac	but it's called get lucky um i play the role of bridget um it's kind of a really gritty drama kind of film so yeah a lot of gun chases lot very different to anything i've done before so that'd be fun and ive also got a comedy
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00001.flac	guys who get them to trouble with a casino hit it goes wrong the end up breaking off the wrong people um i play a lady to bridget who's here to start trouble amongst the boys
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00002.flac	you know it's it's a really fun action packed film um it's pay yeah it's fun and yeah it was great
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00003.flac	well i like the fact that the characters are likeable you know um a lot of british gangster type films though they're all incredible it's they're all so violent and they can be very dark and kind of shocking with this is it has got a comedy element to it so all the characters are very likeable you want them to succeed in doing all the the the bad things which is a bit strange but yeah know the characters are likable and yeah you you like them you warm to them i think that's what
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00004.flac	well apparently it does apparently this role does come naturally to me um not complaining at the my favorite kinds of roles um and yeah apparently it's it's it's what i'm i'm good at so yeah i love i love playing those kinds of always
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00005.flac	i can kick a bit of a um you know amongst the men i think that's there's a lot of a big girl power element to it um i've always been a one of the bond girls you know whether they're coming in there they look in all six in their dress
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00006.flac	i think that's there's a lot of a big girl power power element to it um i've always
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00007.flac	they are not not girls um and they can really handle themselves amongst you know uh kind of egotistical powerful men um yeah so there's a a a huge girlpower elements
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00008.flac	you know what it was so fun i was kind of nervous before us
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00009.flac	it is a comedy it's very rod um it's about a couple who uh there engage
id10291_TMCTm7GxiDE_00010.flac	um i mean such as saying thank you for your support you know um yes i love you will please keep watching my films and yeah hopefully
id10291_aQ6uxeakacs_00001.flac	oh a complete mix of things um i play something different completely every scene that i mean so yeah it's just really fun a tracing woman's incredible she's she's an amazing woman she's so fun she's so talented and she's such a great person in real life she's such a laugh offset too and so that's been really fun doing it with her
id10291_aQ6uxeakacs_00002.flac	i do i think that america do it very well um yeah there's there's so many amazing beautiful funny women in america i feel like brits are quite repressed when it comes to that sometimes there is definitely um a bit of sexes i'm going on that people think women can't be funny um i like to think it's changing i hope
id10291_aQ6uxeakacs_00003.flac	we just you know we just have to kind of do our best in all the work that we do and enjoy the work we do and stick fingers up to anyone who says
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00001.flac	how excited i am um i am such a huge fan huge rices base fan i think he's a genius
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00002.flac	um change the history of comedy with david brent um he created a whole new kind of john and a whole new a whole new mannerisms and ways that people speak to each other which i find fascinating um change the history of time there goes david brent i must remember to thank
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00003.flac	because there's something so endearing about it i think the thing about great comedy is that it's got to have a real heart to it and i think when somebody makes that much of a fool of themselves and but they think they're smashing it that's the thing they think they all in it and they think that everyone likes they think they're really cool and actually behind their backs people are
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00004.flac	so i think yeah i think it's quite endearing and i think people like that i think that was what makes him so likeable even though he's a let old people that you know gets everything wrong i think people really you really root for him because it is endearing and he's just trying to be pounds with everyone he's you know he's trying really hard um and there's no males in it he he's just he's just trying really hard and i i think that's what people like i think that's why he's there
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00005.flac	i've got a few things i'm i'm filming the train and sketch show at the moment um which has been really fun i've just i've just got back from the cotswolds filming father brown as well um and i've got some films coming out that i should be promoting very soon so yeah it's all good i've i've worked a lot of this show ive been really lucky the show
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00007.flac	oh god he was amazing and i was a big point i didn't actually have any scenes with him um but i met him and on set and he was he was great and yeah it was i've been so lucky the the the last few jobs i've had i've worked with some absolute legends my next goal is rich so hoping to kind of him in tonight
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00008.flac	oh a complete mix of things um i play something different completely every scene that i mean so yeah i just really fun a tracing woman's incredible she's she's an amazing woman she's so fun she's so talented and she's such a great person in real life she's such a laugh offset too and so that's been really fun doing it with her
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00009.flac	i do i think that america do it very well um yeah there's there's so many amazing beautiful funny women in america i feel like brits are quite repressed when it comes to that sometimes there is definitely um a bit of sexes i'm going on that people think women can't be funny um i like to think it's changing i hope
id10291_d2Lasybvo7s_00010.flac	we just you know we just have to kind of do our best in all the work that we do and enjoy the work we do and stick to fingers up to anyone who says
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00001.flac	yeah i play lydia who is on and he goes on his statue comes back
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00002.flac	she's trying to get intimate with him and he's just not having any of it because he doesn't want her to know obviously that he's contracted and so this it shows all the hilarious things he has to do to kind of distract her from wanting to have
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00003.flac	yeah and he has to retrace his steps and find out where this this came from so uh yeah no i just i read the script i thought was really funny um it's an original idea i don't think i've ever heard of a film doing something like that so yeah and i just i really love the part and i like i loved the relationship with with lid and i think it's it's sweet and it's actually quite sad watching the breakdown of their relationship because i think there was a lot there in the beginning so yeah
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00004.flac	well i don't think in any other kind of you know wedding
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00005.flac	involved this particular subject of catching and you know you think there's gonna be in all these kind of rom coms you think it's gonna be a happy ending they gotta get married it's all gonna be a lovely but you know when you watch this film to our knowledge this guy is cheated on so it's kind of like you know it's it's a bit dark really there's uh yeah so you kind of wonder if there really is gonna be a happy ending i think with other films you kind of know there's gonna be a happy ending and it's all gonna be a lovely but this one you
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00006.flac	was so great working with fillip mark they are absolutely hilarious uh we were filming in new castle for quite a long time and we just had so much fun it was so so fun i made great friends with them and we were right three i was gonna say three but that would be weird um but yeah we had some
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00007.flac	was actually as on the screen it was it was still really fun but it was more
id10291_iPZGPcrYIZs_00008.flac	talk about that fun the next day on the set and yeah they there were times where they both kind of ganged up on me a little bit but i did
id10291_ibDSPLFJIu0_00001.flac	which completely opposite end of the scale it's a ridiculous hilarious gory horror film set in it and lost on piece take over the island um and it all gets really really disgusting and glory so you know if you like that sort of stuff you'll you'll love that um and i've got another film called iron sky to coming out the sequel to iron sky uh with tom green so yeah it's been it's been a really interesting complete
id10291_ibDSPLFJIu0_00002.flac	oh god he was amazing and i was a big point i didn't actually have any scenes with him um but i met him and on set and he was he was great and yeah it was i've been so lucky the the the last few jobs i've had i've worked with some absolute legends my next goal is rich so hoping to kind of timing
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00001.flac	two brothers who the kind of lovable kind of characters i mean they're
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00002.flac	um they get into serious trouble they they rip off in a very nasty guy then
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00003.flac	two brothers um and in the meantime there's uh a lady hanging around causing
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00004.flac	um and yeah so she she always for the lead guy um lucky played by look treadaway and they develop romance but she's actually
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00005.flac	we like to think yeah i mean the make
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00006.flac	i i think cause he just tries so hard you've got you know can't knock a man for trying that
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00007.flac	no i was i honestly had never put on a pair of ice gates in my entire life and then i got the phone called sales
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00008.flac	completely for me especially yeah um and so yeah i i was i was picked and it was it was amazing it was one of the most incredible experiences because
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00009.flac	say it still from the in between is a lot of it i mean um i've done things like eating
id10291_kt4P4cyTpWQ_00010.flac	any sort of some women might be offended by those kind of
id10291_oLJhH76d0kU_00001.flac	a i've always loved i i grew up around it um and yeah i've just always been a massive massive sport of it it's just the most fun thing in the world and it's definitely something i'm i'm looking at
id10291_oLJhH76d0kU_00002.flac	it was a dream an absolute dream job uh i'm so lucky i still can't believe that i actually i actually did that job um yeah
id10291_oLJhH76d0kU_00003.flac	you know just every day with those guys was
id10291_oLJhH76d0kU_00004.flac	possibly what's going on next uh yeah quite a star stuff i'm not really able to talk about actress is always
id10291_oLJhH76d0kU_00005.flac	self tape so it's hilarious cause you have to just kind of do it so quickly get it done in your bedroom as quickly as possible so you have to get rid of all your clothes
id10291_oa10caYOOzk_00001.flac	on a film with me barton in new york yeah we we film partly in london and part in new york so that was really good i really enjoyed it so that would be out i think i think maybe in time films take

id10291_uiBjIKX_0l8_00001.flac	how excited i am um i am such a huge fan huge rices base fan i think he's a genius
id10291_uiBjIKX_0l8_00002.flac	um change the history of comedy with david brent um he created a whole new kind of john and a whole new a whole new mannerisms and ways that people speak to each other which i find fascinating um change the history of time there goes david brent i must remember to thank
id10291_uiBjIKX_0l8_00003.flac	because there's something so endearing about it i think the thing about great comedy is that it's got to have a real heart to it and i think when somebody makes that much of a fool of themselves and but they think they're smashing it that's the thing they think they all in it and they think that everyone likes they think they're really cool and actually behind their backs people are
id10291_uiBjIKX_0l8_00004.flac	so i think yeah i think it's quite endearing and i think people like that i think that was what makes him so likeable even though he's a let old people that you know gets everything wrong i think people really you really root for him because it is endearing and he's just trying to be pounds with everyone he's you know he's trying really hard um and there's no males in it he he's just he's just trying really hard and i i think that's what people like i think that's why he's there
id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00001.flac	when when you're dealing with it in a drama center uh late at night you're gonna get everything right because our gonna get a gunshot victim you're gonna get people have been in in high intense accident and a lot of that stuff happens at night time right i mean that
id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00002.flac	a lot of bad acne people are tired you got drunk drivers with all that stuff and you're also gonna get the very you're gonna get the dregs of society all the way the top as gonna be i think a whole vast spectra
id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00003.flac	it it's pretty real because answered and wee girl called maria and we guy called elites and we were doing you know we had some stuff outside with with a guy falling on a tree branch and then mars has been dealing with with the stuff as well so it's pretty specific and it's pretty real and they're not letting us do anything nice it's it's one hundred percent the way it should be um i i've got a science degrees i've done microblog in biochemistry and all that crap and it was a pain in the sun and so i have a i have an idea and i've done lifesaving and all that kind of
id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00004.flac	the basic aspects of it but they're very very specific about this is how you got to do things and and so that's taken a bit of time to make sure we get it right because no point there's no point doing it in a hospital if you gonna do it wrong
id10293_Aj0X181Clk0_00001.flac	so it's hard to underwear i mean those those those type clothes made it's difficult because you got the underworld
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00001.flac	drama film featured myself and tom hopper's two brothers
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00002.flac	it's a drama drawn from um a section of john
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00003.flac	because it it is quite a sprawling plot that and of what happens in and things just started to recur and i don't give away too much to have to trust me that it's
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00004.flac	various rewards in terms of copies of the script uh you get to come to the screen
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00005.flac	can actually be in the film itself need extras in certain scenes have gone to self into open and if you guys wanna come along to be great
id10293_CvoEw4AJj6c_00001.flac	myself because it is it is where most movie takes place and it becomes this kind of
id10293_CvoEw4AJj6c_00002.flac	the dark new ones of of of of the psychological aspect of of people
id10293_CvoEw4AJj6c_00003.flac	there a lot of character in it and it's just really really scary and when i read it i was like this is is just kind of messed up and then when you read it and it's messed up then it's gonna be even better we actually see it in
id10293_EHtXD7XFeeI_00001.flac	for studs comes and he said can i re your football bits and i say and i needed for an audition i was like you can't play football and he said no i can't say if you can of my boots if i can come and go okay fine so i came along and auditioned and uh poll gave me the part and then i was doing my finals and college well i was on studs for weeks with believe and david will mark so it with my these is
id10293_EHtXD7XFeeI_00002.flac	the very start i almost took bradley's head off and came out blood of bruce nukes and get to kind of take me down and go on so you don't actually have to kill me i was like no no this is fun cause you kind of feel like you know you get into a proper fight and the you realize
id10293_EHtXD7XFeeI_00003.flac	every and each other because i felt that he was messing up and he thought that i was missing and we ended up getting really into it and almost killed each other for half an hour were literally doing this fight and was very serious as the only kind
id10293_EHtXD7XFeeI_00004.flac	i i'm i'm not sure i was cinematography in a film called charlie casanova which is coming out it's gonna be released in january and fear which
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00001.flac	i i actually love everything to do it and then to do with film and i just think um i think he can as a director as
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00002.flac	as much control about it and it's it is a different it's a different way of working but at the same time it's all the same thing is
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00003.flac	film yeah i mean that's a very good example i i think i think it's because you get experience being on set and being with people and kind of get it
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00004.flac	thing and then you get to kind of un you're more aware of how to tell a story i think if your
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00005.flac	you're more aware of how to tell a story i think if you're working and say as an actor and you see it from a different perspective and get people take you
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00006.flac	i had no idea i think i joined drama because he was loved
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00007.flac	i actually did the santa um for the first film i i directed christian blake which is released and she did the centre for that and one did a lot of music for i did a documentary for tee
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00008.flac	and they come from germany and australia and astra just to come down actually watch your film and shooting this scene is a magnificent counsel and it's kind of like being in a fairy tale and you sit there in france and this is great kind of a holiday and then here about two three people
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00009.flac	a holiday and then the thing the people standing there just watching you do your scene
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00010.flac	it's really nice it's almost like doing theater in a way and you're doing this scene and you know and then they're all watching they're already sweet and it's kind of
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00011.flac	i think what they do they have a really interesting take on the whole theory and tales and the kind the camelot era and that kind of thing and then they've done a lot of that kind of stuff
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00012.flac	few of those things before and i think they do a lot as i have fun with it
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00013.flac	so it's the jemison empire sixty second competition which myself and jim chain which is a wonderful judging and he did it last year and it's it's i did a couple years
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00014.flac	as you can just go and which i make to make a really interesting the thing and someone like jim is gonna see it and and a friend of mine did it last year and and a girl acted in one of the pieces i didn't win but jim actually saw and they wanted to meet her just
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00015.flac	in this piece and it's a great opportunity to to send someone marcial was on it last year and he judges at the end
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00016.flac	both mexico and that's getting released in the cinema in january there were just found out yesterday
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00001.flac	you know it's actually some because everyone was really really cool and some really cool people and i got to meet the guys who made
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00002.flac	these homeless guys who attacked these this group of women and these group of girls and then this supernatural creature occurs at the highest the crescendo of the violence from man to man in the negative energy basicly brings in a creature which has
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00003.flac	uh cause you know it was because you got to look at from an acting point of view seeing where it went with with these different these different people those guys and the girls but also because i wanted to explore
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00004.flac	some supernatural creature would come from and what whether you know whether it draws a jasper between a good person a bad person whether like agosto creature would just kill everybody and i was like where i come from and i think it should come from negative energy that's kind
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00005.flac	one of my best mate he's brilliant as brilliant as brand fortune was not a regular friend of mine all three of us have worked together quite
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00006.flac	a train and so i got like five or six
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00007.flac	i don't need just use my own film with as an example but what we tried to do was it's a bit of drama and it
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00008.flac	i don't need just use my own film with as an example but what we tried to do was it's a bit of drama and relationships
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00009.flac	there's not a lot of times you see a breakdown of someone's human relationship and then something rific happens and brings people together how they deal with their situation struggle and you can a drama does really get that across all the time and the horror actually allows to see people in these extreme circumstances and see what people react to what they'll do
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00010.flac	the biggest influence on cause and also rose s babies a very clever film because i also look at society and looks at people in relations is not just about a film it's it's an awful lot
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00011.flac	i'd like to make my films away and i think it's important that you can make entertainment and then also i try and have something through it even if it's very suttle someone takes it from but i think
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00012.flac	can explore i think it's important sometimes to explore negative aspects of society and people's psyches
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00013.flac	i'll put a number for a counseling on my website and then if you wanna go to that person and then give out to me
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00001.flac	it was i was really excited because i thought that pad created the character that that it was really interesting to me and it was quite dark and quite layered and and then i went oh god i really wanna do
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00002.flac	for no character no i think what what paul does really cleverly is papas actually kind of he understands the games in a way where that's why he's able to create the world so well but he's done things sometimes he's create characters himself to fit for how he wants the movies to go just what he did with alice and what he did with with with with my character so
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00003.flac	some moments there's some moments were kinda like you know go down some carders and and you kinda go and i remember this and then something is jumping at it you're like gonna little bit of kit flashbacks being fifteen years old and in
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00004.flac	nighttime a lot we shot in in the rain in the darkness we had two or three hundred
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00005.flac	there 's a lot of there's a lot of choreography makes great stunt guy nathan has to do a great job but at the same time when everything is suddenly coming at you it you're kind of a little bit like i like hotels happening so there's moments when everything there's these big fences and old ones trying to get through and you have a vague idea of where you're marks supposed to be but at the same time it's instinctual to just figure
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00006.flac	they were one or two from things only because when you're doing stuff we're jumping off
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00007.flac	just to kind of rolling around you get the phone but that was more that you don't break the prop not about you they jus don't have to fix the prop
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00008.flac	i said how stupid i just wanted to keep filming stuff whenever he called out i wanted to film everything was going
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00009.flac	i like having a coffee and just talking about the weather and so yeah you know the the atmosphere they create on set menu have i have a great energy about them and they just make it
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00001.flac	once all the land and xbox and and the commodore sixty four and all that stuff i've i've been playing games and i used to play
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00002.flac	to watch because it kinda has everything in it and as a movie i think for me personally it's the best one and it just ties everything together so i think you can watch this movie if you haven't watch you the five and if you have watched the five
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00003.flac	first i was like the start of of zombies coming back into kind of movie making i think cause they had to lie
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00004.flac	not for me because i was just mean the movie the pressure's all on me and paul so for me i was just kinda doing my thing and just kinda you know just just being accepted by them hoping to kinda do a good job but it's afterwards you realize how important it is to a lot of people
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00005.flac	do me good wrote the script script i think is like the action star for me for like the last fifteen years and
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00006.flac	they they just made me feel very welcome it was a very uh it's a very chill vibe it's very intense because we're doing this these crazy sequences and it's a crazy big set and they make it really chill and and paul and me have their daughter ever in the movie as well and all been there for a while so it's a very nice
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00008.flac	they they did take up a couple of the crew were gone so i didn't wanna meet the people are there figure to me
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00009.flac	he has this great way whereby he's doing these incredibly huge sequences he's got this whole movie mapped out in his head and he just makes it very chili he i never saw him once gets dressed he just makes the whole thing very easy
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00010.flac	it almost feels like cause what we're doing was so hectic and so on and turned to the scope for it to be so enjoyable and relaxed almost seems like
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00001.flac	did you know with being suspended so come back in the season to he still suspended suspended the start
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00002.flac	to being brought back into the hospital he's he's also everyone's aware they had to break down uh and he he ended up talking about a lot of his issues and going through trying to deal a lot them with george and so i started this
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00003.flac	look after other people instead of himself which is his way of dealing with his own demons and exercising what's happened to it
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00004.flac	he's very complex because there's also a darkness to him which i think is what people connected because everyone's got that kind of darkness
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00005.flac	to uh he's trying hard to deal with that in the cope with all these things have happened to him from being a stand with his brother and that's hard and i think that's he's a very human character and he's had
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00006.flac	i think all the characters really are really identifiable because they're all real they're all real people and you got it's the way that they've kind of created the characters like a drew and go on and that they're real people who kind of you care about and they got you know um
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00007.flac	it's always much easier when i come back to the second season because you know everybody and so you can kind of mess around with people more and you understand their fools everyone has a different way
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00008.flac	and and you get each other because you don't even have to act anymore have to time because you're just you're like talking to your friends
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00009.flac	fabricating something it's like we understand each other we know who we are and everyone knows who the characters are so no one's everyone just kind of
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00010.flac	fun right but it's fun but there's also there's a lot of kind of humor to it but then it's quite energetic which i think it's really important and it's quite real and all the characters
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00011.flac	sucked into something to dramatic all the time and that's kind of lighting the little bit then it goes down again there's a lot of intensity to it so there's a there's a lot of kind energy with it and i think that's the fun thing about the show is because it's always got a good pace to it and that's what makes
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00012.flac	i thought i knew a little bit and i put all these books to learn but we do some really really really interesting stuff like doing amos and all the all these things you wouldn't normally
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00013.flac	so i got people like john frog and you worked for years so you do learn about a lot of stuff they wouldn't know but otherwise which is
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00001.flac	the movie was initiation to be one that the the very first day they they throw me on set and we had this big making a three page scene and it's you know we're in this massive set and these guns and i had to do all the dialogue and we had to kinda get really
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00002.flac	great stunk guy called tamara whose fantastic and did all like the african shows such as dominion and stuff so he was he was really on top of it but they let me
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00003.flac	the cool stuff like coming down off the the the the grading and off
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00004.flac	stuff and yeah he has the most of unless it came like very very very fine detail stuff they let me do a lot of it but nathan was great because he oversaw
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00005.flac	you kind of think i really do these stunts and they don't they let me do it and then you oh there's two of the people who if i break my finger out myself we have to change the scene so it's not about you know
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00006.flac	and she's beautiful right i mean i i remember i mean when you see me fifteen
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00007.flac	the original evil she's she's beautiful and she's still beautiful and she's just the most wonderful person she's a wonderful actress and i just i
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00008.flac	creates that vibe on set where she makes it you know everything
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00009.flac	i don't get too much and you should get it going through a going through airport security or go through immigration and
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00010.flac	you know and i used to get really worried going though migration in america a cause you guys make it all very very serious and
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00011.flac	texting on my buddies when i told them i was gonna be playing a larger love interest and they were quite jellous because
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00012.flac	back on nightshift uh we started about two months i'm doing a movie with a buddy of mine and about three weeks
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00001.flac	he was doing at the top and the tale of the film the rest it's all shot sequentially from start to finish and
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00002.flac	but he listens to me and i think every time i direct him we have
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00003.flac	just explore that you don't have to work with other things and then because you understand each other's actors i know to direct
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00004.flac	and it's sequentially allowed people to be free and then see where their characters are going it wouldn't work
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00005.flac	that's the kinda hit of what man can do to men and then i wanted to see
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00006.flac	that was like what you're saying about keeping it sequential so i wanted i wanted to just get real reactions everything was very real so because we didn't i didn't like i don't even like to do
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00001.flac	dislike for what has happened and for himself he does not care for the most
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00002.flac	needs to have an outlet to focus i think i think even though i think maybe because he is spending so much time looking after other people he actually needs to be able to
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00003.flac	and i can imagine to be doing it in real life working for twelve to fourteen hours it would be stressful
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00004.flac	following certain regulations he's trading for him because it takes time and and he doesn't like
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00001.flac	of a small group of rebels who are kind of just about barely surviving in raccoon city and they're exhausted and there's a lot of in inner fighting and and little factions developing and he's just about keeping together and along with claire redfield and he's a the two of them are romantically intertwined and they're kind of just about surviving and do is uh when me or alaska
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00002.flac	little reluctantly yeah well you know i think he kind of looks he's he's he's reluctant leader and that he's looking at after everybody but at the same time
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00003.flac	it was quite a humbling and then ever made me feel very very special and had a really nice time it was a really nice group of people and i think that's important in doing a movie that's kind of that's as important as the last one to franchise and is this big you kind of anna work with people
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00004.flac	you know and so you know you're working long hours and it's difficult it's tough but if you get on with people you know
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00005.flac	like we're gonna do this you go that's that's you know they're better than me but if you can get away with
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00006.flac	fourteen years old that's all that's kind of what being an actor is in your head right it's
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00007.flac	so these actors from south africa who are who are made up as themes and the um when you have a crowd of a group of people at nighttime surrounded by fire and they're all done up ames and their whole mandate is to try and keep
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00008.flac	you know i can become a little break because i come at you through the grading
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00001.flac	just really like inspired by the man made charlie cause i worked pretty hard and inspired by man for what she does now she worked for my sister everybody you know about my grandma
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00002.flac	last question in the amount section have you ever had any funny encounters with
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00003.flac	quicker from all the places you went to what was a favorite place to shoot and when
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00004.flac	you find most actors i find when you do a character you know part of it becomes you
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00005.flac	are you going to be directing staring at any more movies or projects in the
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00006.flac	will you be reprising role as an in season five this question is from wood

id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00008.flac	i 'm quite glad about that personally i'm quite glad next question do you like to travel and have you ever gone to any exotic places from elena
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00001.flac	that that was a big accent shooting at night time which is you know i i thought you mexico is gonna be hot this is cold this is this is like as bad
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00002.flac	who is the the business element of the episode of the of the hospital um and
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00003.flac	and this incident with the little boy and the car accident is
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00004.flac	the motivating factor which kind of starts a lot of the clash between the two of them and then george is kind of the the counterpoint between all
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00005.flac	you know you have to treat as a business or what so that's kind of that's the fundamental core of this
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00006.flac	in combat situations and dealing with life and death situations if you've got somebody in a suit telling what to do you don't wanna listen to that you don't listen to anybody in a suit telling what to do anybody but uh so i think that's that's the fundamental reason why they don't get on and then rego telling it what to do and does it with him because for it's about saving lives and you know the whatever thing else rigor has to treat it
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00007.flac	because george is there and now she's engaged and so you got the whole uh you know girlfriend boyfriend type thing on and the clash a lot but they still carry about each
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00008.flac	uh late at night you're gonna get everything right because our gonna get all gunshot victims you're gon get people have been in in high intense accidents and a lot of that stuff happens at night time right i mean that that's realistically when you get a lot of bad accents people are tired you got drunk drivers with all that stuff and you also gonna get the very you're gonna get the dregs of society all the at the top is gonna be i think a whole vast spectral but it's all the um i think it's some of these
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00009.flac	the characters have to approach it the same way cause life is too short and i think if you see people who are dying in front of you well then you know you gotta find the humor in it eventually and you gotta find the humor and everything else around you otherwise you know life's too more be a morose
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00010.flac	play some pool shot on and just you know chill and just get away from everything
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00011.flac	see all these heart and lungs and john does this great job by there's these perfect replicas of like an open heart surgery of like someone spin and so and as cool as like all this kind of weird jam
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00012.flac	this is essentially um it's kinda like mash meets i guess in the hospital so it's it's a more high octane version of of of a doctor how it's not like anything i ever watched
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00013.flac	it's very different because you're dealing and fat with with a night shift which has got very different type of of nasa would have the day shift a hospital i wasn't aware about it i did it my
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00014.flac	so it's it's it's got this great uh mixture of um of drama of
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00015.flac	and so forth married to this uh this kind of
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00016.flac	my situation because you have all you know already to to the army and so in that in that situation is a nice bit comedy to it like man is a lot of
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00017.flac	i play catch who is a an ex at who is enough and with with
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00018.flac	you know see him off a lot from when he was
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00019.flac	so it is suffering off a lot from having been enough gate and now he's working in the year and the reason why he works in the yard and the night shift is because he still gives him
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00020.flac	dude who's very quick to anger but he's a very very very smart doctor but he just does not like being told what to do so he likes doing things his own way
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00021.flac	the character of this someone has been in the army but has always found it difficult to follow warders directly she's always tried to do his own thing and not actually led to him being um being
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00022.flac	out of the army essentially because he wasn't always following directors so in the yard a little fabric in terms if he understands how to do things and he doesn't usually wait to be told what to do well just do it
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00023.flac	well but it is always the one who kind of go out and kind of um uh and there the ones will go out into the environment to with the rest cater to bring people in and they leave the and i kind of bring in patients who are in trouble and self what they do they don't just stay in
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00024.flac	yeah i think pretty pretty much every episode so far there's there's a big event and that's what's
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00025.flac	it is interesting there's a lot of there's a lot of intensity in a lot of high drama going on but it still got this this lovely sense of pace and this is nice
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00026.flac	and when moms actually after she she was teaching a pre nursing
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00027.flac	i took over her course my dad was sick for three or four one so i actually taught this stuff
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00028.flac	not the usual day type stuff but also because of this and create with
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00029.flac	thanks to the army and stuff it and everything that goes on at night time it's like the whole idea that you know there's a full moon weird stuff happens right so at nighttime weirder stuff seems to happen in a hospital that's all the crazies come in so it's already got to that extra element of crazy is attached to it and you go to hold the stuff with the army which is a very interesting namic and you got these are doctors so everything is more intense than they've kind of dealt with death in a different level
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00030.flac	it also was quite it's like mash you know i mean a mash has been on for a long time so it's got that comedy with a lot of drama with a lot of action so it's there's a lot of
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00001.flac	so not releasing that mean you are because um you were you remember the show as from the a i loved math
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00002.flac	you remember them you remember the show as from the as i love math and and this shows more is more kind of associated with that because we got the kind of military aspect it's also a lot of kind of black humor in our show which is different so great and in any which are great shows but they're more dramatic and as has the drama but it's got these different elements so it's actually quite different
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00003.flac	the interesting thing is because he's always on the edge because he's been to war and he suffers
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00004.flac	on a real guy a real character and then uh we've a lot of military people working with the show so um and it's a military hospital and to all the cases are stuff that actually happens and i think that's what also makes the show
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00005.flac	kind of element to it in terms of all the cases and hyper realism that's
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00006.flac	you say it is a bit chaotic and a bit it's fun we have we have two doctors who work in the set all the time
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00007.flac	and my answers a doctor so i spent some time with them and i've got a lot of books i've got loads of books and i didn't read them but i have there so it makes you feel
id10293_mNM0rMPJE10_00001.flac	and and i think it's it's it's interesting whether the medicine and looking after somebody doesn't become an actual business and takes away from the motif human aspect of it and that's kind about the two fighting it because to just wants to save people and doesn't really care about you know business and authority and all that kind of stuff and georgian does and she needs to look after the actual you know the paper work in the business aspect of it because otherwise the hospital will not work and then what it doesn't work then
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00001.flac	he kinda does his own thing which is incredibly attractive to play is
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00002.flac	character and it's incredibly active to watch cause you're watching someone which is um i think it makes you comfortable to watch somebody who doesn't really care because you don't kind of worry about that
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00003.flac	it feeds his own feelings of guilt so he has to every single person that comes in
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00004.flac	saving somebody's life because it was almost like saving a life it's almost like um saving part of his past because of the things have happened to him
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00005.flac	body or you know somebody who is so hellbent on doing the right thing and and so help to help someone else or they're just incredibly certain about what they wanna do that you automatically want to support them in that and i think that's what it is and the
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00006.flac	and alexander and that is a very destructive lationship but more so for that one for adding actually for
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00007.flac	i love his affection and proud and self one
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00008.flac	and i've heard from a lot of people friends of mine that you don't often get that and the same as on this show that we just happen to have this really great group of people were by everyone the way they cast and put it together is is is really interesting because
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00009.flac	yeah i think it helps i think in the most important thing i think with acting is that you trust the other person
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00010.flac	from curve and dan was the guy who uh when i was
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00011.flac	and about acting and so when a student studying and then me myself and danny started making
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00012.flac	we are on screen which is really weird because as very um is very and he's got this
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00013.flac	get to act with his character which has been given to me by virtue of what the character
id10293_r4aP67VNNrc_00001.flac	i think just a few people know but everyone's really sweet and everyone's like you know and it's nice to people actually
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00001.flac	do a lot of postproduction makes a perfect you now it takes a bit of a year anyway
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00002.flac	its very very differently it's a very kind of um it's very real place i mean i was in for about two or three months like kind of really enjoyed it and i had a lot of very interesting people but it's kind of
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00003.flac	because everyone's in this kind of very very considerable of kind of and it just all the bad kind of actor you know kinda getting there being on tv and being on film
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00004.flac	i actually got very lucky and i actually met somebody in london actually was in and then i went over down to meet them and then it was kind of was actually in the spirit moment things that i go for two weeks if i meet somebody great and then i just did and then i met a man manager in company met an agent and there and i just
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00005.flac	some stuff i'd done they just done so i had a few bits and pieces and i did some did a few manage for them and then they
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00006.flac	you go on will be before the wedding crashers and he doesn't actually like wilson and hotel on wilson
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00007.flac	a kind of a mark walberg so he's kind of he knows a lot of people and the kind of knows
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00008.flac	and then he's very private about eight people class and the kind of help
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00009.flac	the time i'm on it but i kinda think it's gonna do it as long as i'm enjoying it a kind of really interesting people kinda mean it's going along quite well so i mean if it goes out well
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00010.flac	well i i directed a film which i'm kind of post looking at the moment so
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00011.flac	all done just by mid summer next year but that was a there's a big experience i just love
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00012.flac	the jewish film festival i mean they're met them on to go to stud and they're great because he and are helpful to people who wanna get involved in a film so the competition and the idea is basically anybody
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00013.flac	and in any medium format and you gotta submit a sixty second advertisement for
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00014.flac	is the winner which we think the entries are gonna be in about twenty four the january and the winner gets three this now puts the film shown in the film festival and then also i think they kind of maybe transcribed onto thirty five minutes
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00015.flac	shooting straight after christmas uh some stuff for jane and i got to do a few pick up some passion and then
id10293_uYi5KwUCqGU_00001.flac	you see every all the big parts and everything have to audition for it and usually you might do a tape and then go to
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00001.flac	if i fit in properly because i i i loved the movies and i love the computer games i wanted to do it justice but um it was payment made it very easy you know paul gave me the room and in the space to kind explore the character that i wanted to and work with me was just it was
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00002.flac	so it just makes everything nice and simple you know so there's no it was a very calm it's a very intense shooting schedule and very intense set but it's very com
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00003.flac	do that much i think the vast majority well i mean there there's there's obviously a bit in terms of enhancing still but the vast majority was paul wanted to go back to shooting the way you would with everything in camera so he had all these kind of really crazy locations like this is if you remember the they're really
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00004.flac	that's all that's all like that's not a set that's all a big building danberg it's it's
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00005.flac	thirty stories away and and none of that and all the sets they built in or not they built they they would find these ready old buildings erect them and then kind of create the set in there so a lot of it is just
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00006.flac	and that's again i've still got this memory which which won't leave me which is because when i play them
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00007.flac	the bloody house and you have to open doors and then some juice and you just go onto and even when you know you have
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00008.flac	and you just go on to and even when you know you have to open the door and you know what the thing is gonna come from it just still gets every time that was my very first memory of an evil
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00009.flac	he gave me a lot of scope to kind of i mean a very very interesting ideas of this character anyway so is kind of easy for me to come in and go cool and he knew what he wanted from the characters
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00010.flac	but he he allowed me the freedom to kinda just play with stuff and he trusted me because we shot a lot of it sequentially so i was like okay we're gonna this is where i want the character to go to the end so we had to kinda trust me to let me play it that way until we got to that part
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00001.flac	so they sent a telegram to spain saying from now on we want canada to have an itch
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00002.flac	you have to look at people at a normal people who were said to go along with that
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00003.flac	not only that it does a disservice to those who study history you learn nothing from
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00004.flac	he only learned from how was it possible for that machinery to convince otherwise good and normal people my father only remembers a good man but he was very convinced of it between thirty three and thirteen
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00005.flac	so the question of antisemitism all that that came up but there was
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00006.flac	major issue for hitler for germans a side issue not important was important they had food on the table and suddenly many was recognized again
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00007.flac	where they show nothing but these characters they have contributed nothing to them
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00008.flac	the reality in north africa was that rule for with a small group against the entire british came and beat the crap out of most of them most of the time that was the reality rapid turned that around people often ask me what do you what do you think about it
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00009.flac	what all those series did retro combat
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00010.flac	listen to what i'm saying is very important because i feel that that feeling of omnipotence was created by
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00011.flac	the reality of the second world war was that the russians contributed enormously decisively
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00012.flac	big moro and chris george and various people
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00013.flac	that was the hardest most terrible war in the history
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00014.flac	because hollywood contributed to the notion that we alone on that
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00001.flac	again because of this the appetite of daytime is so enormous is so avaricious it's it it just eats you up unless you gained the right
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00002.flac	and she said why don't you use this as a challenge
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00003.flac	but they said no no there's written in stone you can't change anything i said you must be
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00004.flac	and then west west kinney came the producer skinny and he's the reason
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00005.flac	this doesn't begin to see how bad change is a dam right
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00006.flac	and bill knew i changed some things but he never let it be
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00007.flac	and i never changed characters or whatever nothing like that but
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00001.flac	and she asked me i was rather mysteriously wealthy character but no one knew exactly what my background
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00002.flac	it was taken away to be alone with me i was really i was just
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00003.flac	when you do a film or when you're in the television because you're isolated you you don't realize the effect
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00004.flac	apply to anyone who does time or theater or film the differences they don't go out enough
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00005.flac	i did not realize that what i did made a difference to some people and this medium and i'm eternally grateful to it
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00006.flac	i have always been very welcoming anyone is different
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00007.flac	not telling the truth i've always welcomed actors coming in to uh the situation
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00008.flac	and i am very supportive especially of young actors because nobody
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00009.flac	and you're exposing yourself right there fun of everyone to judge you
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00010.flac	stuff so i've always been very supportive of actors
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00011.flac	once i'm finished with him you have lost his family his house is
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00012.flac	to make it and i can't do for very long we start laughing
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00013.flac	comes from a very bright family and and therefore it's a great sense of humor and we just laugh a lot he's
id10294_GzajCggf7-8_00001.flac	need a lot of german actors to be an american television programs
id10294_JUyxHgPHR-s_00001.flac	gang mccloud was with the same agency i had been with so i knew these
id10294_JUyxHgPHR-s_00002.flac	i played a hapa simon character remember that that very cynical
id10294_Jr2KDTTWYgM_00001.flac	one of my most um favorite memories i loved that show i love everyone
id10294_Jr2KDTTWYgM_00002.flac	shows john many was the executive producer and he was a eleven
id10294_Jr2KDTTWYgM_00003.flac	and dark all those professors they're wonderful people very nice people
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00001.flac	we badly need taxis when you go to asia for example you go to where the stones and you almost never see it break out if you go to the bars in england or scotland germany fights break out all the time
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00002.flac	now there was a induce this violent behavior i've never known a stoner
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00003.flac	we have three hundred seventeen million people across the border from canada in mexico every year hundreds
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00004.flac	they have found very little deleterious about pot and if for example someone is found driving a car under the influence
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00001.flac	so i looked across the street and there was a reason
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00002.flac	i thought well i can do that so i went and they applied had a job the next
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00003.flac	scale was one of the restaurants in town at the time on such bullion and the one agency the coinage stage across so they came to lunch there sometimes so i got to talking to watercolor who came with us about is where you find
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00004.flac	they need a lot of demand young man actors now for a series like like gallant men
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00005.flac	simply as a means of making money at first so they asked me to read something and i did and it was a very good added and the first interview i went to was a dreadful film called operation in these really the most just caught a man and
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00006.flac	went home but i had never been on a film studio before never acted before never seen a script before so they kept on sending me blue pages yellow pages pink pages as this
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00007.flac	i wasn't hour half late i was in the first scenes so i remember coming finally to the gate they rush
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00008.flac	this is red so now i come onto the set and cameras and all that had never seen any of that before in my
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00009.flac	so the director came i forget the director's name and he said you know when one comes out he walks up here and you walk this way then you meet at them
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00010.flac	a very kind sweet soul that looked at me and knew i was
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00011.flac	a little rose they said but it wasn't because of me was because something went
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00012.flac	i said no which is you have to say this sort of fortunately
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00013.flac	and twenty minutes later i had it obviously and they were ready took twenty minutes for them to three
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00001.flac	and um always warm always embracing always understanding the character you're
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00002.flac	i never really felt that you would have to talk to audiences away from me because when i've encountered them
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00003.flac	it 's been nothing but just an outpouring of warmth and emotion and and and i never
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00004.flac	so what's illustrated in an article about this character where the interview
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00005.flac	hers and the writers and basketball and what the male players like is the fact that victor numan doesn't take any
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00006.flac	there was an article recently that came out about prisoners it's their favorite character because he doesn't take any
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00007.flac	so it's more complex than than they love to hate that's it's more complex than that
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00001.flac	attitude simply is that he will not be dictated to by a woman but he will not be dictated
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00002.flac	conversely i as a man don't have the right to talk
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00003.flac	it's a question of mutual respect between the
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00004.flac	and then you have suddenly the woman making anathema gonna happen
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00005.flac	in the role of sports you don't bullshit you don't say someone you bubba
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00006.flac	as soon as their feelings of omnipotence as soon as as a man or as a woman who walks around as well when i throw my head around
id10294_PfQFgX_pBfU_00001.flac	always played the bad guy and i was tired of that to be honest with you but very grateful to
id10294_PfQFgX_pBfU_00002.flac	in hollywood hundred fifty thousand of which one percent
id10294_TsdCaeLEoOU_00001.flac	to approach me as a brain you know and sometimes in the moment of passionate
id10294_VPcqW7TXwkw_00001.flac	so then four weeks later they asked me to please please please james cameron wanted to see me
id10294_VPcqW7TXwkw_00002.flac	i said why he says why do you say he's gonna be successful i said this because it's a barbara and i know something about bears it's a very
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00001.flac	i have nothing more interesting to do in other words if i ever had enough courage to direct
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00002.flac	with the name and school guys was proud of it still proud of it but i wasn't
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00003.flac	meaning the contributions of german events of this country have been overwhelming
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00004.flac	we had made at home we had uh we did very well when he
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00005.flac	so what does what grabs anyone to become famous
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00006.flac	do you become what you do now why does this director become a director why because we want to affect people's lives
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00007.flac	that is the essence of art that is the essence of
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00008.flac	but to many parts in the world hundred fifty million people in the world
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00009.flac	characters you have the extreme right guy in america ronald rees
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00010.flac	kind of just who is wise enough to know that she simply cannot keep up the arms and that it is
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00001.flac	three years seventy seventy three seventy four they made no films in hollywood
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00002.flac	they had wanted me to sign an all inclusive contract television and film i said no no television just film was an egregious
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00003.flac	the represented tony curtis and anthony in and jim and all those people who suddenly were doing television because they're
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00004.flac	they approached me and her and it took me to lunch at the ice
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00005.flac	for two or three years they knew they were friends of loose and they knew the financial conditions of them
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00006.flac	didn't know anything but hang on because movie producers didn't watch
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00007.flac	he didn't know he just saw the film he said all that interesting
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00008.flac	alex was the agent and i went to his house
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00009.flac	and he said to you sort of a british passport i said
id10294_WJPpL58RruA_00010.flac	no one would play james bond but someone who was a member
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00001.flac	ginning there wrote sort of as a as as a you know the the the domineering husband and and and she was the former stripper but you know nickel
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00002.flac	you do something in the audience whatever that is
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00003.flac	i and i think that is what people are partly attracted to in this character he's vulnerable he's not only tough and he's at
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00004.flac	the part very was simply very passionately very never
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00005.flac	kind of hostile and seeing the erian
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00006.flac	parting to overcome the again i i i you know there's some relationships like that you know it's i mean think of richard britain and elizabeth taylor for example i mean it's it's
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00001.flac	do a screen test at universal studios for a film called colossus the fort
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00002.flac	flew back to spain to finish and rifles i were sharing an apartment my wife and i were showing a huge flat with under lamented
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00003.flac	and i remember the car came in from alex rules the agency said loose and love the test wants you to play
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00004.flac	and how they played nothing but noise and
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00005.flac	so i took the first part of the village i came from and drama called being big
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00006.flac	i imagine how unsettling this is a new name suddenly the most powerful man in town stops at a table and says low
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00001.flac	melody tomas who is very quick very quick study great sense
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00002.flac	and of course what is the essence of what we do is to make something that someone else wrote real
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00003.flac	you know what's the most difficult is to do those simple scene
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00004.flac	i think i don't actually know how i learn i i don't i still don't know i think it
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00005.flac	and i was always very cavity about learning my dialogue because i learned very quickly
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00006.flac	use all kinds of base or to analogy i know nothing about baseball and mathematical
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00007.flac	well it's the only time i ever did fifteen
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00008.flac	a glorious understand it and it it it's like a tail it becomes narrow and
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00009.flac	never been so scared in my life worse than opening night on broadway
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00001.flac	and the certain issues i obviously didn't discuss but most of it
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00002.flac	is responsible for that part of germany
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00003.flac	that whole period should remind people of the importance of understanding what
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00004.flac	bridge certain freedoms they won't get away with it because the found foundation a rock of this country
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00005.flac	a screen test youniverse studios i did and go back to
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00006.flac	talk we sort of come down and said you know you've always said you want to get out
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00001.flac	as a bill i have played bad guys for so many years i'm empty i'm just
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00002.flac	can be somehow assigned something to the background of the
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00003.flac	where nicky melodies never knew anything about my past and she asked me some
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00004.flac	he gave this man a background where he was left in an opened at the age of seven by his parents destitute parents moment i played
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00005.flac	i knew i was gonna stay because it humanizes
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00006.flac	i said my mother maybe imposter an imposter after
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00001.flac	and yet the writers in daytime have a very difficult task because they need to write some
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00002.flac	that is one thing i learned on the show by doing public appearances every
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00003.flac	in the provinces in the sticks of canada and of america and the south of the north of the west and east everywhere small towns
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00004.flac	there's a condescension in the hollywood towards that unwashed audience mass
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00005.flac	you change your mind about that you become more modest about it and you become far more
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00006.flac	can tell you stories to the cows come in we wanna do that but it's enormous
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00001.flac	a hunter and i didn't see much of them they were very nice of course i felt very sorry for them because they had to be in the make room
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00002.flac	uh given back directors and producers never i would target for that i never wanted to evoke the impression that i was there to
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00003.flac	because i have known a lot of actors who knew a lot of people in this business and never got work because in the end it's a business they don't give a ship where they live on the moon or not they want you to perform and that's it
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00004.flac	so they said well we have a ping pong tournament i said i mean anything with sports so as part of the tournament where walter
id10295_2NX7pAXpu5U_00001.flac	and westbrook under and you know it's just fun it's fun it's a good time to be
id10295_3KnwlyXVpv4_00001.flac	take that seriously i'm not i'm you know in the show i'm on now i uh within five seasons i'll be three hundred and ten pounds with a meatball in one hand and a bat and the other sitting at the helm bark
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00001.flac	san francisco and los angeles are are separated by about four hundred miles but they couldn't be worlds apart you know
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00002.flac	i i i was a water polo player in high school and my season ended short and i ended up uh getting roped into doing a play uh joked uh played joke keller and all my sons the great arthur miller
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00003.flac	and i said this is what i wanna do with the rest of my life so i just i i moved down
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00004.flac	well it's about uh you know a global pandemic in a ship that's left out uh in the open water that hasn't been touched by the irish yet and it's their job to try to create a vaccine and and save the world we get a sort of
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00005.flac	and uh when we get back to the states we realized there's really nothing left there for us so it's
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00006.flac	you know us against the the rest of the world and some of the government militaries have gone rogue and um we have to stop at guantanamo bay to pick up food and fuel it's um it's a pretty interesting premise and it's a very exciting i show you know some thirty years ago this would have been considered science fiction now it's highly probable which is
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00007.flac	its very very accurate you know and and we worked very closely with the united states navy on this michael bay has a great relationship with the department of defense in the united states
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00008.flac	um we couldn't make this show with him and we have their full support we also had great technical advisers and lions from the nave on set with us every day making sure that we were depicting the lives of these people as accurately as possible in the circumstances that we were in some
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00009.flac	as accurate a portrayal of an end of day sort of scenario or or annapolis u based on an outbreak of a virus
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00010.flac	and i missed the guys that i was working with um i spent seven years of my life with them i spent
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00011.flac	you know just as much time with them as i did with my family and i miss them and congratulations to them for ford
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00012.flac	continued success that show just doesn't stop u but i had a great time working on that show and i wish them all
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00013.flac	i had a fan that while i was at the indianapolis five hundred with demy um
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00014.flac	um run up to me and and latch on to me um and asked me for a picture and i said sure i'll take a picture um but she had nobody with her to take the pictures so she just started screaming out to any random person um to take
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00015.flac	uh and and it literally it was like a five minute embrace i didn't know what to do somebody
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00016.flac	now i'm teaching my oldest and my youngest to swim so we spent a lot of time in the pool but i'm a homebody i spent a lot of time at home with them and you know i'm at work a lot so when i'm not working i like to uh i like to stay around the house and and and hang out with
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00001.flac	i haven't entirely gotten used to it yet i actually didn't even know that i was referred to as a time until my wife saw the episode and told
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00002.flac	they had a scene that that they had mocked up for the reading i read it i didn't say anything about it but nothing bad has come of it
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00003.flac	so i tie it off and i let my hands go and and throw caution to the wind and see what happens it could be very uncomfortable on a set in front of forty fifty people on a beach it's different on a set when everybody else is full
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00004.flac	before they get to the boring credits and and and things of that nature i just put i look great with me
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00005.flac	uh lesson acting lesson the director was the only one on the set allowed to yell cut and i would do these scenes and it was my first
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00006.flac	interesting thing was they didn't they didn't even have you know usually you have an elvis person or that you can take pick with after to create more memories and uh all we had was a an elvis statue and it looked like they just ripped off of bob's big boy and
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00001.flac	do spend a significant amount of time in the gym but uh i've always done that it just makes me feel good i like to stay
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00002.flac	yeah i don't you know i don't i don't i i think for this character i think it kinda works to play against all of that
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00003.flac	and i i i play against all the bets that are obvious and support that because i think there's more too
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00004.flac	you know you don't spend a lot of time with the character and it's it's not
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00005.flac	actress you don't really get to uncover what makes this person tick you know in one fell swoop it's sort of
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00006.flac	he walks in with with her and i asked him if it was bring a hot blonde workday that was
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00007.flac	cause the doctors at the hospital are so ugly we have to bring in gorgeous guest stars to create a balance
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00008.flac	was a pretty formidable guest star i think she did like six six seven howman
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00009.flac	recognized a lot in france i was in france over the summer and that was weird
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00010.flac	you know to get recognized in another country is you know aside from the fact that they're recognizing you with an accent it's it's kind of something else
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00011.flac	i think nine million people watch ran out of me a week in france not a lot of
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00012.flac	you know i didn't know we reached out that far now you know i guess season three in japan that's about as far as it
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00013.flac	yeah i get asked our fans are very sane you know we
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00014.flac	and they're just uh generally interested in in the show and then
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00015.flac	crazy about him so i i certainly have no problem taking
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00016.flac	season three and i don't know if you guys have seen it yet but you will
id10295_NLyQte6Mhj0_00001.flac	i didn't play rugby it was a lot lighter i see with a water polo player which is kinda rugby
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00001.flac	leaving the guy a one dimensional character a um because then you kind
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00002.flac	the the one thing i wanted to do is make sure that he wasn't the antagonist at the end of the film you should be sort of torn
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00003.flac	and i wanted to make this guy's motive for taking over this club sort of
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00004.flac	deceitful undermining scream to snatch up this club so that i can
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00005.flac	you slip into habits because the way these things are written sometimes it's very
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00006.flac	so you just have to stay i just had to stay on my toes and and make sure that i wasn't sort of hitting the stereotypical beats of the and
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00001.flac	father likes to say you know you put your pants on the same way in
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00002.flac	a little annoying sometimes but i have to stop and say okay this is my mom you know you want fifty sign head shots i'll get him
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00003.flac	she loves it she goes out like you know if i cover a tv guy or something she goes by ten
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00004.flac	and then she shows them to me when i go home like i haven't seen them before she's like look at you
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00005.flac	she makes anxiety she needs to be like sedated before she gets in the chair i have the greatest
id10295_OCO9SWN7EOQ_00001.flac	billion dollar set to use and it wasn't at our disposal as much as we would
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00001.flac	yeah rebecka was convinced we were having a boy i said great name after my father
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00002.flac	and uh when we found out it was a girl i said great well after my father
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00003.flac	i think probably yeah i think we would we would have to have him living
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00004.flac	you know i think the first episode is kind of business as usual and then we slowly sort of egress and and and deal with
id10295_WZ3jbVwrmS8_00001.flac	but i'm sure it was great i have a picture of it and i tell people i met william cover was a great guy but you
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00001.flac	it is my first time in sweeten i have never been a stock home and it is absolutely
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00002.flac	i'm so sorry man i apologize it's my apology that look the waters on me i'm at
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00003.flac	well um i like to do everything with them they're young my wife uh we've been married
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00004.flac	but we love the sea we left to go to the movies we have a movie
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00005.flac	and how sincere he is and at times
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00006.flac	i sort of my life outside of the action at my life so my professional life
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00007.flac	you know i've been quite successful in the past ten fifteen years and i've been very fortunate to be able to work in that
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00008.flac	and the characters you play that you put up on the screen are the people you bring home with you if that makes sense
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00009.flac	for sure and you know it's depending i mean a lot of the famous people are not as interesting as you would
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00010.flac	make i always i always say fame makes good
id10295_iVxjBZtQwBg_00001.flac	apples and oranges you know if i'm riding to work i like to be in a car just because i like the quiet that you're afforded
id10295_iVxjBZtQwBg_00002.flac	in an automobile but uh on the weekends when i just kinda want to relax and go do my thing and not have any sort of
id10295_iVxjBZtQwBg_00003.flac	i write with a couple of friends we go out to people
id10295_kTLpYHUNf5A_00001.flac	is very easy it's very he's much funnier than i am so any time he makes a suggestion
id10295_kTLpYHUNf5A_00002.flac	and it's uh he knows what he wants it's it's it's fun it's like
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00001.flac	when you spend fifteen hours you know maybe sometimes fifty hours per episode with somebody you don't really find it necessary to spend time with an outside of that
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00002.flac	we got separated we had a we you know cause there's five hundred thousand people in indianapolis and you know patrick and i walking through the go a little dog sometimes but it was fun um and i got separated from this whole group of people that we were walking with
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00003.flac	so big and she goes oh my god you have to get a lot i take a picture taken
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00004.flac	and i thought maybe i was looking around to find out who had the camera she nobody she wasn't with anybody nobody had a camera she was just scream
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00005.flac	egyptian guy was telling me to do is amazing he said but summer
id10295_vHpJ0TSVKZs_00001.flac	we are we get a lot of support from the navy we are forever indebted to them they have been
id10295_vHpJ0TSVKZs_00002.flac	uh and once you put on the uniform and and you sit in the captain's chair it's
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00001.flac	because you know and it's it's i i i you know looking back hindsight is twenty twenty i figured out you know if i were expecting something like that i would have seen it coming but i didn't know until the host opened the door and she pushed me into a room filled with all my friends that it was actually happening which was kinda nice
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00002.flac	do i froze for a little bit and then i started seeing you know recognizable faces and then you wonder what they're all doing in the same spot i realized well this is for
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00003.flac	a month for the first went to monte carlo in london i did some promotion for the show and then we went to paris
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00004.flac	where kids think that's the backlash and uh you know because
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00001.flac	season four was kind of a you know a throwback to the original grave which was you know a year before
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00002.flac	i did i think i still have a shot i think the invitation still open so we'll see if i take it or not but uh yeah i felt a little
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00003.flac	dedicated to isolating mark one at the end of the season leaving him we just
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00004.flac	i personally love city we have a great
id10296_0mOnLGSG2jM_00001.flac	well yeah i mean it's hard it's hard to talk about a show like this and not give too much away but but basically um the future of america and i know this is hard to buy
id10296_0mOnLGSG2jM_00002.flac	the last minute before they die take over their body like jumping into a car before it goes off a cliff and then we live their lives and it's it's one way ticket we're not going back to the future
id10296_0mOnLGSG2jM_00003.flac	a premise and some of the missions that we are here to take care of some of the
id10296_2btSCK00syA_00001.flac	i used to remember this time i was interviewed by people magazine i they asked me something about
id10296_5K8DAWq6wJc_00001.flac	some clips just now to a packed room like four thousand people and the reaction was what we've seen all along which is the film was
id10296_5K8DAWq6wJc_00002.flac	purity and i think so much of of these days and then
id10296_8X8huGiBRAc_00001.flac	uh well paris which which is what happens to it's very exciting episode but let's be honest we couldn't shoot in paris all season
id10296_8X8huGiBRAc_00002.flac	and that's what happens in paris and uh and it's uh but but because he and
id10296_CdDxsQV7RJM_00001.flac	as developed as i didn't i didn't see coming in
id10296_CdDxsQV7RJM_00002.flac	it's a crime solving show and i think it's gonna be a great fit on albums
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00001.flac	but um i was thirty five when i got on so i mean it
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00002.flac	so while i was working i was never famous i never you know it
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00003.flac	okay but i i i did a lot of guest star stuff i did a lot of
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00004.flac	but if you have to do it but i don't know one thing i would say is don't put all your eggs in one basket uh don't fit
id10296_KPKQZjynKsg_00001.flac	blow their own images but for me in police was one of the earliest ones where we weren't thinking we were on a show that
id10296_KPKQZjynKsg_00002.flac	and then he showed up as are our producers said is blind
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00001.flac	explore more of that i mean i think that we start the second season with him on his
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00002.flac	so i don't know how long that's gonna last but uh it certainly will lend itself to to connecting more with
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00003.flac	with people on a romantic level um not sure but i think there's gonna be little more
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00004.flac	we're going to know both both now now that we've established the show and how in the end of the show i think we will start to get to know
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00005.flac	help not just solve a crime but helps him deal with life it is his
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00006.flac	responded to this relationship uh the way they they they loved i mean the the show is very complex the writers the writers
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00007.flac	last episode of the season i've watched it four times i was in it and i'm still going wow this is
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00008.flac	attention and they seem to be reacting well to you know for us not talking about of them but but you know writing to offer smart
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00009.flac	when there's an episode that was about religion and about the great
id10296_OVqjDafJiGQ_00001.flac	uh well paris which which is what happens to it's very exciting episode but let's be honest we couldn't shoot in paris all season
id10296_OVqjDafJiGQ_00002.flac	that 's what happens in paris and uh and it's uh but but because
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00001.flac	movie of the week with roma downey and uh we've stayed we've stayed in touch and and for many
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00002.flac	he's a funny guy he's he's a guy that gets everything he wants uh until until this happens and it all starts to fall apart so when uh when benson and taylor first meet him he's
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00003.flac	i love i'm in my forties and i think all guys in their forties are trying to keep
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00004.flac	with music and what's going on with the culture and with technology and this this is a guy that that's doing it he's he's in there he's dating young women he's made his fortune with the the latest conning edge technology i'm none of those things but it was a nice stretch for
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00005.flac	clearly very welcoming i i can't i can't think of another set that i'd rather be on at this point i i hope i i hope
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00006.flac	in a show like this any of the law orders sometimes the guest stars get the greatest stuff to do because they got us all the crimes we we get to commit them so
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00007.flac	all of them these two characters in particular have had the most from what i've seen
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00008.flac	america and in christmas characters we we've met the other people in their lives we've seen their pain so we get so when they have an episode where it's more about the guest stars we still know their backstories and i think it helps to make them
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00009.flac	i think what makes television shows last a long time is is chemistry i mean the scripts can be great if if you're not really giving it can only the love can only go so far i think people really dig uh chris and maria together um i think women are are obviously attracted to him but they're really attracted to her as as a as a role model and i think that the nature of these stories
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00010.flac	just uh solving the crime the crime gets us in the gut every time because it is it is about victims it is about women almost always and uh we all have sisters and
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00001.flac	the casting is everything comrades is everything you can have great writing and that never gets realized if if if there isn't a jew
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00002.flac	the casting process was amazing because to to make a character like daniel palatable you've got to understand what others can see in him and and she's such an empathetic character in such a beautiful girl and that
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00003.flac	and she and i've just connected and that can be that can be tough you don't connect with your with your leading lady with yourself crimes to be a long days but she's so great and then bringing scott wall front of the show or a smith and love or britain is it's just a lovely lovely group of people there isn't a bad and uh i think that
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00004.flac	have something that i realize i may never have and
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00005.flac	in the last five episodes um a definite shift on dan's part to how he looks at her
id10296_ZEpT2orkZTc_00001.flac	there is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change your life as an affect you at all
id10296_ZEpT2orkZTc_00002.flac	feeling inside that you made a lot thousands and thousands of people and their families happy by simply checking a different box
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00001.flac	well i have to carry the way to the gay community on a sitcom
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00002.flac	i didn't think it would be her it's like there's something there's a bigger subject matter that we can um
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00003.flac	for god's sake and and and stopped drinking so much because i just were
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00004.flac	pages i can't believe it because i'm as like as a guy turning
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00005.flac	he was a guy watching me at that point do the thing that he was probably
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00006.flac	scrapbook dedicated to my father's days as an actor at writers and the pictures of
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00007.flac	and he said mum i'm very proud of you and then he gave me a hug and walked
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00001.flac	it was well i have to carry the way to the gay community on a sitcom
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00002.flac	i didn't think it would be hard it's like there's something there's a bigger subject matter that we can
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00003.flac	and he actually even went to prison and i found out in iran i mean i said that i'm going to
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00004.flac	the scrapbook dedicated to my father's days as an actor at writers and the pictures have
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00005.flac	and he said mum i'm very proud of you and he gave me a hug and walk
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00001.flac	i love playing somebody smarter than me i love i love throwing big words
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00002.flac	he and he loves it that's the thing you know he's he's a teacher and he's a scientist and he loves a kind of welding um that that intelligence around and and of course the irony being that because he's gets orenic his his brain can turn on him and her
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00003.flac	in me which is great i mean when we shot the pilot which was actually a couple of years ago now it was going back to two thousand ten but i did a lot of research i wanted to make sure that i i got it right right out of the gate uh because it matters because i wanted the uh the mental health community to to respect the show
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00004.flac	trust my instincts and who this guy is and we can have just a lot of a lot of fun solving crimes coming up with a really interesting twists and turns that only a neuro science bent and and his experts can can
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00005.flac	my favorite is the show begins and ends most most episodes with with lectures
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00006.flac	takes me all the way back to you might remember this the paper chase in the seventies which i just love
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00007.flac	law school show um and and the the but the lectures are fun he's like the the the professor you wish you had he's like that guy
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00008.flac	what he does and funny and a little sexy i hope and so and this kind of book end the show and and and i give it a a different feel and and that's um it's exstent but it's uh it's so
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00009.flac	there's there's always tomorrow you can never take it for granted that this is gonna last forever as an actor even even in a successful show they can they come and go and um you've gotta keep inventing yourself and and keep looking forward and remember that this could all disappear and first and foremost comes comes your family and home
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00001.flac	he hadn't uh because he was a general practitioner he was a doctor
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00002.flac	good to be an actor it was looked down upon and i think he just kept it a secret he hid behind his doctor in this but secretly snuck down
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00003.flac	very wooden and shallow as an actor so i i found that it just lent
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00004.flac	that would be over what they should take away i think is the sense that that there was a time when when
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00005.flac	fear might he be the motivation behind them and ultimately it was about entertainment and about
id10296_p1--IINtgGg_00002.flac	counter productive in that way we we we jumped ahead in the in the in the series finale to twenty years later so we've already seen well in grass separate and come back together as as older friends so
id10296_p1--IINtgGg_00003.flac	you know i think if we have a reunion it will be as actors looking
id10296_p1--IINtgGg_00004.flac	on a tuesday night in front of an audience where the show lived and the audience was i had waited six months for these tickets and and and the room was absolutely alive that's i think that's where the show
id10296_sr0JJ4UghCE_00001.flac	sort of people living with parents as far or high functioning can can hold a job sometimes very responsible jobs um there's a woman who's been a real influence to men named ellen sacks who is a law professor at us and in california and has been living with parents cause for many for years she wrote a book called the center cannot hold
id10296_sr0JJ4UghCE_00002.flac	at at at nobody may actually have held a job and may actually have had something else going on but they're not we can't just dismiss them at the stigma of mental illness is is the biggest thing
id10296_sr0JJ4UghCE_00003.flac	like daniel with such influence and and and such ability uh reminds people
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00001.flac	well for me canada is also my son's birthday he was born in the states he's an american born but on canada day so uh we were usually up there my wife and son are up there right now in canada in in our house in vancouver uh with the fireworks and the barbecue you know very much the same as us here but i miss it because i mean i'm still in new york finishing up a show on
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00002.flac	we we were doing a very very funny bit written by willing great writers and will and grace essentially deb and i were doing our characters and we had a very funny bit about about how you know the project is it's it is about
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00003.flac	for youth um gay and straight our equal that they they they hopefully we were getting into a world where it's not an issue that kids won't be bullied and we we made a joke about not only are they equal or better wouldn't it we wouldn't be great if our kids and then we had a whole bunch of jokes about the things that are
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00004.flac	he completely shut down that his whatever comfort he has in the classroom he does not have on a crime scene he does not have in the offices with the clattering typewriters and the and the phones ringing it's
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00005.flac	cost and in the midst of it he's a guy that is hence the title of the show he is perceiving the world in such a way that it makes him an interesting
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00006.flac	his is the guy that keeps uh daniel pierce
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00007.flac	centered because stan is a guy that should be on his meds and he is not um and that is a key element of the show without max as his
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00008.flac	goes on he told her to be his teacher's aide and he's sort of um uh assistant but he's a lot more than that he's
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00009.flac	he keeps dangle grounded and uh does my wife do the same yes in fact it's probably the opposite i probably drive my wife
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00010.flac	oh uh it's hard it's it's it's almost sounds easy for to to say from someone that has had a chance to to achieve these things but i i
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00011.flac	don't don't give up i mean i just i can't imagine my life if i had questioned the was a lot of
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00012.flac	it was a nice suggestion but for me it was it was going full throttle and never doing
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00001.flac	so i would i go out of the stage door at the end of the show every night and there's all these women with their with their program in the
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00002.flac	did you like the play she said it was oh you were great i just i think i like you
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00003.flac	phones in the end the the the uh food that the worst for me was i played another
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00004.flac	about six years ago uh it's it's gonna be type casting now and and uh
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00005.flac	play and it's me and four women and and in course the play i i'm just awful to each of them at the end of the play a more tiny walked offstage and i'm left there the guy in the front role
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00006.flac	leave the stage i sit down and devastated and before the lights even go down
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00007.flac	we all walked in and when james walked in it was it was like you know the the the pope had walked in and very very quickly
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00008.flac	okay with that i i asked him to put put himself on tape for a friend of mine who was turning fifty it was
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00009.flac	it was a woman but i don't think he heard that part and i said just say whatever you want to say happy
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00001.flac	but bob has put me in a movie back in nineteen eighty three calle start where i murdered or strategy
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00002.flac	probably one of the two most are directors i've ever worked with and the
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00003.flac	you could make up a question and he would give you a real answer it was bizarre and uh and he's also an actor so he understands us and he knows how to talk to us and knows how to do
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00004.flac	everything across the board everything above title is all slights alone you realize he might be a genius and it's an over use and abuse word but he might be a genius the guys
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00005.flac	i say italy as i walk on the set every day okay
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00006.flac	in the last batman who had to had to go had to go on his part had to go out
id10297_23tlx1v1UCA_00001.flac	freak you out now and that's why i made it when i when i read it it was free to director told me how i was gonna
id10297_2eJ33J6xFVM_00001.flac	that or best the best or it's my party one of those three i hear about every air
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00001.flac	i just have a good time i i i like sit at home and my my wife is also my manager um put put scripts on my death
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00002.flac	and i go to work and now she she runs the show basically and i
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00003.flac	he always says to me it's a it's an odd statement and hand it always it always throws me they always say you should be bigger
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00004.flac	yeah in fact i did my first play at four and a half and i played at
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00005.flac	later in grammar school you know how you how you go and run around the room and everybody reads
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00006.flac	i said i could speak but but but if i didn't i go
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00007.flac	i was under a lot of pressure and that's also that's also a part of them
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00008.flac	well you know there's also when some parents to live
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00009.flac	like um you said you saw the uh the uh the yeah the idea now i know that was a real wacko that was a crazy guy and he shot people up and he was a strange and odd and all the stuff and i was very good in that part i love those kind of characters but everybody thinks he must be
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00010.flac	be around for forty five years fifty years and uh
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00011.flac	okay so it isn't about you know quality it's about how much how much how much you've done so i went after i went after everything and i sense since then i've probably made a hundred
id10297_3vnz4Iy5fMg_00001.flac	that if you never insulted a child ever heard a child physically or ever ever humiliated a child that
id10297_3vnz4Iy5fMg_00002.flac	he's the nicest person i ever met and the best kids drive
id10297_6-VE8e8RtZE_00001.flac	common questions fans asked me things like do you and just to get a little and uh and we do and uh you know let me let me let me clear something up right here right now all those rumors about us
id10297_6-VE8e8RtZE_00002.flac	along all happened because i got her started in show business right so then she gets a pretty woman and becomes the uh the biggest on there
id10297_6-VE8e8RtZE_00003.flac	and the press was still you know talking to were like are all sisters and one day she got sick of it and said i don't wanna hear his name anymore so it must probably no
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00001.flac	every day and i go to see him alive whenever i can because he makes my
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00002.flac	a wonderful series called bullet in the face asking what is
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00003.flac	bullet in the face yeah it's cool anyway it's with eduard and uh who's my favorite comic on the planet because uh because richard prior died and and uh and uh i love the guy and uh he's a great guy too and we had a good time together and we made and we and we made a series and uh we made made
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00004.flac	the at the beginning of the series and uh i think it's gonna be good it's a very black black black black black comedy and uh so is worth surprise
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00005.flac	edible he's so gifted he's so smart and he's so gentle so nice
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00006.flac	but uh yeah we're we're having a good time in the seats also everybody's very sweet this year and i i know what i know what's the weather because it's always dump you had been here for the whole time everybody's cranky cause i have done all o th beautiful clothes like i mentioned everybody's very sweet this year it's very nice everybody says excuse me and you
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00007.flac	in a very a very small what i consider to be
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00008.flac	love i think it's all love about linda lovelace with
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00009.flac	she uh she grabbed it and he holds on to it well she's a she's really spectacular
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00010.flac	i think i think if this if this film gets uh the uh the distribution that obviously will
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00011.flac	her promotes a lovelace and uh and a bullet in the face and uh and say hi to you and uh my uh my family big fans of years by the way they they love watching you and uh just to pass on i told
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00012.flac	for p and is called bakeshop
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00013.flac	bishop dot com not put in and if you want the best
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00001.flac	uh it is a major problem and set it in a way that that that we'd have to deal with
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00002.flac	were i would lie about it but uh i think i think the state oddly enough has a very good
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00003.flac	very far away and i was tired and i get home and i'm told by my wife and manager that i i i have an audition for a so called heroes and i went i'm too tired cannot
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00004.flac	after story i cannot get a date for three years with a nice girl and that's not
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00005.flac	as as is supposed to be and that you don't know where you gonna take our people since i recite the hero is he looking for
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00006.flac	or the week after in my brain that actually changes the whole course of my
id10297_HAinRPec5xI_00001.flac	anybody in this no matter what how fast that the internet be camera acting writing producing directing whatever it is everybody you meet like you're gonna be your boss tomorrow
id10297_HXlH44r0jYc_00001.flac	the butcher was the originality and the cleverness of the script i mean it it was something i hadn't read before or seen before even though it is it is a shoot em up bannock down a movie
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00001.flac	like anything else in the whole world it's what you make of it and i know that sounds
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00002.flac	i don't think i do reader but uh but i understand them into being in my forties i understand their mistakes i don't condone them but i understand them and uh and i'm not angry with them anymore i think i think
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00003.flac	most stable but and they're both
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00004.flac	which is a big problem but uh but but but but besides that too
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00005.flac	well how to get out of it i basically i basically ruined every relationship i ever had ruined my career ruined everything so i had nowhere to go but up
id10297_lF4tSoY-iF4_00001.flac	which um is a good thing because in the words of thomas jefferson we need a revolution every three or four years
id10297_m-v3iy3sVjs_00001.flac	in eighty seven of all the heavy stuff but then i i kept i kept chipping and kept kept revisiting it up into a really
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00001.flac	me dad what are you doing you have to do this video okay so i called her back and i said it too late and she said no come on so it
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00002.flac	i fell in love with the killers they were great bunch of guys and uh had a great time and that that video went into numbers
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00003.flac	they carry video and a kind of video and those number one so i'm the number one
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00004.flac	and then just just a quick story i had these two white
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00005.flac	he like gave me this horse pregnant so i have these two beautiful wide horses
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00006.flac	worst food and the hottest weather i've ever encountered in
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00007.flac	i just learned what's what's our national park in the state trying to middle of our country what's it called that great big park where they had
id10297_o1EKUvjvNHY_00008.flac	and uh it would make sense for all the all the old faithful stuff but i'm but i'm told win win and if but it's a win you know that as it might be a hundred years or five hundred years or or next tuesday but i'm

id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00004.flac	along all happened because i got her started in show business right so then she gets a pretty woman and becomes the uh the biggest on there
id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00005.flac	and the press was still you know talking to were like are little sister and one day she got sick of it and said i don't wanna hear his name anymore so it must be a problem no

id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00007.flac	anyway it was a lot of fun slice alone is probably the most fun of any director
id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00008.flac	proud i was a very hard film cause called star dan i play a really bad guy but it was
id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00009.flac	like me i have a bad things about me but but this guy was
id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00010.flac	and uh so it was hard to play but i had a great director of bob bosse so um it was a lot of fun and i'm very proud of the works on thin
id10297_utAY0zpsv1U_00011.flac	with it is after i've played that role and so i couldn't get a date with a nice crop for three years
id10297_uxHwuJ59xNk_00001.flac	director i've ever really loved and i probably really loved about half a dozen of them
id10297_uxHwuJ59xNk_00002.flac	and uh but she's married to it you know for a real reason you're not just because she wrote it now she she she has real reasons and if you listened to her she probably is the most intelligent woman i've ever been a room with with with the exception of my wife
id10297_uxHwuJ59xNk_00003.flac	that's a huge complet cause uh you know my wife's a boy genius anyway um yeah

id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00001.flac	these can lack this is merely you had them all here larry tor
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00002.flac	wonderful i had a really great time i was i was supposed to be in three days and it was a month which is
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00003.flac	he was the me that could be and get paid for being
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00004.flac	it was working in me that's right
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00005.flac	i took it a step further i was able to use the power that i had gotten in getting there
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00006.flac	italian american was written for the american most like you know what an axe
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00007.flac	and it was not in it but when i got it right away i signed the contract i worked into producers offices had a chaplain about you know wouldn't make sense for the
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00008.flac	i said would make sense to us i'm manic america what we changed the name to puncture and make him
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00009.flac	and they went with it even then you know you had cops
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00010.flac	i started getting roles because we were never really into positive role
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00011.flac	i wanted to take him to task before we went into syndication because you go into indication on what happens is that
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00012.flac	james garden eleven years fighting them in port to get your money and i said
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00013.flac	so for me and i said well i have to be present for that of the net profits of spain
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00014.flac	it would take an actor and say look that's not doing increasing so let's just go
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00015.flac	reason for the total because they have two sets of books you don't know so anyway when i walked into david belman's office and then get my two attorneys i said here because i understand uh i sold the
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00016.flac	you need two more years with eastern punch my los find out the idea the idea was that the other six years of a print with states punch so i knew that was my smoking gun so i could walk in there with the journey and say okay now it's done
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00017.flac	since i legally have contraction rights to fifty percent lets have a contract written from
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00018.flac	put me on a defensive so i am but all i did was laugh at him and i told his shoes
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00019.flac	but i never boxed grocers and i walked off the show so they replaced me with bruce and the radius went in the toilet
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00020.flac	the job and as long as that group was still around so i ended up going to mexico and coming back with the number one longest running highest rated latin sophistry of television and so the radios were so strong that it was not an out
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00021.flac	secret to anything no matter even if your plumber or whatever you're into you know i wish that maybe i hadn't sometimes been a carpenter
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00022.flac	a maze of that you know i wouldn't be i wouldn't be in a business that you only work when it's
id10298_6qFnVechX9o_00023.flac	so but unfortunately i fell in love with this passion for this so

id10298_aEuSKFj0xo8_00001.flac	no i wanted to be a cop first new york cop at seventeen i changed my mind and then i got because i got bit by the acting bug in the drama
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00001.flac	he was so as you put something about a uniform as soon as you put it on you get
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00002.flac	but it was it was alright because i knew i was wrong so when the cup by the time he got to my window i already had the lights and sticking out
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00003.flac	when we film on location set her do you get a ticket this morning i said i said i'd just happened to minutes
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00004.flac	its i finished about two and half years ago we finished it originally i was every time i worked in latin america if they would always do my voice cause i was born to raise the new
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00005.flac	and because the show was so big is the highest rate of the spanish show in the history of latin television and still is and the spanish equivalent to the me for
id10298_gNR5NHzd3o0_00001.flac	and that's what it did for me and he was such a great guy for about four years
id10298_hSC1Yb953Sg_00001.flac	show it indicated around the country is on an angle i'm not sure what the syndicated station is for
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00005.flac	you could take advantage of a second chance and if not you can create a second chance by reinventing yourself which i've had to do in this business in show business and
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00006.flac	as a cop on tv because i want to be an actor and then as an actor on tv now in real life i'm a real cop who acts once in a while so i want a complete circle i took advantage of the opportunities that presented themselves
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00007.flac	uh that's why i can personally identify with the message of second chances
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00008.flac	i brought that that's there it's always in there somewhere now so i brought that
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00009.flac	the joy of being involved in a disney project one of the really great things about the movie is a you can bring your child you can park them in front of the screen and you can let them watch this and that she will walk away with
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00010.flac	the with the knowhow and the ability to understand that there are second chances in life that it once presented
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00017.flac	but he races and uh he's quite good at it he's champion admired and
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00018.flac	but he has a a misfortune of his engine
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00019.flac	and what happens is they can't produce that part they don't make it anymore it's discontinue it comes a time in the movie where he has to he has to go into this bridge and then he's got a power up to go straight up
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00020.flac	and he meets those challenges but at the same time puts himself in jeopardy like firefighters do every day front line because if he goes to a certain level of speed he could blow up he could burst
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00021.flac	he achieves a second chance and and and he also shows a great
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00022.flac	people have become cops people that get involved in public service where they're
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00023.flac	because they step to the left or they step to the right or they walk in on a situation like police officers one of the most dangerous things is
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00024.flac	officer and it's the old will tell you the most dangerous call is a domestic
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00025.flac	these people this is their job they become this because they're compassionate
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00026.flac	the job does change cause after the third day on the beat for me and i worked graveyard because i couldn't work during the day it all up on a house or on a call
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00027.flac	and for firefighters who are the first to arrive at a situation at a
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00028.flac	they're the first to show up they they considered we call them as officers we call them the front line but we're right there with them but the front
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00029.flac	hank you is important this movie says thank you firefighters thank you for risk
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00030.flac	they don't really care about getting the mettle they don't really you don't really care about being
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00033.flac	they were the audience is a lie for the same reason i liked it as well personally i'm glad to have been involved but the movie itself is exciting it's funny it's really funny and and the music is
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00034.flac	a simple thing that you get a child at five years old you could teach a child five years
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00035.flac	because it's proven they're more retain at a young age so that's why you gotta get a child young give them the necessary tools to go on in life like
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00036.flac	being open to a second chances you fall down and you get up
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00037.flac	you get up dust yourself off and move forward go and do your dream get it done you can do it you can do it is always the opportunity for a second chance if doesn't present itself you make the opportunity of a second chance for yourself that's what the movie teaches
id10298_qrJ0fQJP5gs_00001.flac	a pilot uh to uh patrick when john wine so that i went up for it in it and then i lost the next one to hades sun and then the third one that i was lucky to go off for waste
id10298_qrJ0fQJP5gs_00002.flac	apartment takes her with the salvation army takes a group of families to target and they have that every first december every year and i show up for that as well but and then a man also um involved i became a deputy sharon beacon lynchburg
id10299_752GDDvGPCA_00001.flac	yeah just a little bit a very humble guy but let's go back to the two thousand twelve for the washington write skins of course with the number two picks selected robert griffin the third and then what surprised so many is then in the fourth round they chose our cousins cousins told me this we the one thing he tried to do was really stay patient and remember as his father told him the cream always rises to the top you'll get your chance and of

id10299_IwB3vu418E4_00002.flac	right now i don't know those things i'm not really at liberty to say

id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00002.flac	a good actor a good actor my in my estimation whenever he's reading something whether it be
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00003.flac	i can place himself in a position of saying that's me i can do that i know how to do it because your imagination
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00004.flac	and rememberance remembrance is an artful big
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00005.flac	i can place himself in a position of saying that's me i can do that i know how to do it because your imagination
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00006.flac	and rememberance rememberance as an artful big
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00008.flac	and nothing else you take the printed word and you make it come from your heart and your head period i i said that one time to these youngsters that were in university going to the school drama i was invited to lecture the school
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00009.flac	uh uh well uh are you one of those um uh what were they used to call millan brando uh that school of acting
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00010.flac	i said what we're doing right now i just talking between each other we're acting this is what acting is all about we are acting to you're listening to me and i'm listening to you i and i answer you in kind to back and forth that
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00011.flac	no no no i couldn't believe it i said what else would
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00012.flac	she had said to you right right that's what acting is all about cause it comes from here
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00013.flac	over these things you know and i i love i love reading between the lines you know to me
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00014.flac	my personage but i the personage of this character that the the writer wrote about
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00015.flac	and so i i go over each and every line do
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00016.flac	there 's that line makes sense to me oh why would i say that line if i you know if i wanted to say something else what would i say in it
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00017.flac	and and all these things i've taken into consideration as we're going along reading and studying because i always feel that somewhere out there
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00018.flac	and you say what do you say what do you say you've lost them you've lost them
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00019.flac	sense to you yet you had to say because it and i say
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00020.flac	that's no good so you break down the word you look up and something that retains to that word and you asked the writer about it naturally he said oh yes yes i should have thought of that myself but you know you work it out and not the first thing you know those users are satisfied so that was that was a good play that was a good show why because he believed it he believed
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00021.flac	not the words of the of the of the of the of the play but he believed what you
id10300_85wn4sW4CgQ_00001.flac	and i are still buddies still friends we now worked eleven not as voices spongebob play mermaid

id10300_mYSVs_d1aMQ_00012.flac	i i didn't want fanfare and i don't like fanfare that much but i think that uh uh the life didn't become any better it became a little bit more
id10300_mYSVs_d1aMQ_00013.flac	out of that contract finally but it was it was terrible
id10300_pVKJjm4sKdI_00001.flac	and that's what life is all about am i really
id10300_pVKJjm4sKdI_00002.flac	you know you you you've had such success in everything else uh how did you get that way i said by studying by
id10300_pVKJjm4sKdI_00003.flac	then they take the thome out you've lost them for the simple reason nobody's paying attention to what you say before i don't understand that a big word that they don't understand you have to break it down to the lowest common denominator so that
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00001.flac	you know we we we we got in and and help people in distress and help and do things you know that um we we get to a point where people actually started believing that this ship was just the way it was we have it over it um at air meets you know when the us navy demonstration team is to come by the blue angels and u were
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00002.flac	and people would look at it and the kids would look at it and we all loaded down with guns and everything else you know and there was there was the you know
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00003.flac	the ship itself oh man and where did it come from the inside of a volcano or less was marvelous you know
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00004.flac	and uh we often used to say no no don't go near it because no we can't tell we didn't never said a word about it you know and everybody believed in my goodness this is really something and we actually had thought that the russians were kind of leroy
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00006.flac	the script like this i say okay i shoot it me i've got
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00007.flac	script and then take every word for what i can you know and make something out of it he could just that he had a photographic mind just like broad cofer had at one time i just
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00008.flac	i often how can the people do it this is amazing to have a photographic memory and shoot
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00009.flac	a wonderful pilot and he took us up for orientation to see how we
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00010.flac	helicopter and he took us up in and we'd go around and do this and do that and we ask questions and he put our hands under control and everything else and i had my hands under control one day and he said okay take over and he pulled his hands
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00011.flac	and and and and and he said no you've had it you've been handling and for five minutes i said what and i suddenly learned a great lesson
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00012.flac	your knees are your still work things and you you hold on your knees and put these things over by your knees and you stay right down and it's all your your feet are working your hands are working and it's one of those kind of you got to be on the ball besides listening to what the radio and everything else you got to be on the ball or be a copper pilot and this well at one time jones was out there doing it
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00013.flac	listening to what the radio and everything else you got to be on the ball a belter pilot and this well at one time jones was out there doing it
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00014.flac	loop the loop you know crazy things over the pacific option while we were shooting down by the water and i said are you doing what i think you're doing
id10301_6uqGkiR2oTI_00001.flac	from china uh after working on a film and was kind of frustrated with his career
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00001.flac	well you know when i first um got the audition for congo or the meeting for congo
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00002.flac	i think we're really really some really creative work and and very courageous
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00003.flac	have a hard time doing but it was great to be a part of it and uh but i think when you're we were first and we didn't get the accolades we didn't get the nominations and the recognition from the the industry but i think by the time we finished and coins came along
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00004.flac	yeah you know i just because i was aware of the prison so i always felt that i had to
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00005.flac	about them and it's all became very important for me to hold my own in the midst of all that you know sometimes
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00006.flac	i put my suit on and so my shoes which is kind
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00007.flac	the character and when i step out on the set the the friendship so it was like i was warden
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00008.flac	and i got that people kind of kept a little distance you know but i never buy the lunch but somehow i wasn't invited you know it was it's always
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00009.flac	oh there's a and i need to do some work on it but it's in hand hutson
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00010.flac	called dune we shot it in texas um as a show i do called sea life there
id10301_BVFTRGHuk3M_00001.flac	you know and i just like to work so i'm open to whatever you know um uh
id10301_BVFTRGHuk3M_00002.flac	uh well you know of course you know i mean i i have four sons so you know the iron man and i was a fan of the marvel comics when i was
id10301_BVFTRGHuk3M_00003.flac	in the movie and have a reason to be the first day i am but yeah i mean i love the checks out some wonderful stuff being made and uh yeah you know and i believe in supporting you know so yeah i'll be there will be in the audience eating my popcorn
id10301_Eu8Bj1gx5_4_00001.flac	uh before he became a movie you know sometimes better to have
id10301_Eu8Bj1gx5_4_00002.flac	um and um you know the black panther is probably um
id10301_UkrkPwZd77Y_00001.flac	this is what it is i love i'm very happy to be a part of it uh i don't understand
id10301_UkrkPwZd77Y_00002.flac	i don't always understand so you know just for the fans know that if i'm not it's not
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00001.flac	uh you know it over the years it's been over thirty years and all these little girls and that got us fits they come up and uh
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00002.flac	representing you know and um you know the script is amazingly funny that
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00003.flac	you know so i'm back and will marry and dan ever and we all coming but the girls
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00004.flac	who you believe is the best performance the worse thing to happen would be for someone to vote based on
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00005.flac	or the performance um so it's not really i think the responsibility of the academy as much as the industry to be more inclusive to allow people off
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00006.flac	nonsense excuse um we need to be more inclusive
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00007.flac	there are directors and and it's all of us excepting the
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00008.flac	look at the world the way the world is i can't tell how many things i've seen and it's like
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00009.flac	so we just have to be and i don't think it's an attempt i think it's just a lack of awareness people go i didn't think about that well it's time to
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00010.flac	i then really focus on other problems because i don't think it's a i don't think it's a major problem we just have to be
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00001.flac	first movie they ever saw whatever so they tied the movie into their lives in a very strange
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00002.flac	i never saw or everyone talk about it so that people
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00003.flac	yeah i've been very blessed i think it's uh you know i'm an actor and so my job is
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00004.flac	well i mean i really love him in that appreciate building he's always been out there
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00005.flac	stronger a movie the second one was more family friendly and i think if you're a little kid and for parents who wanted the kids
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00006.flac	a lot of lines that at the time i was saying them i didn't realize people being you know this
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00007.flac	you know like your work and so i come out here i meet these
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00008.flac	for people who actually see the movie and and and its register you know so i mean it
id10301_hX6LjjVtnGs_00001.flac	seen the movie about a hundred and fifty times and he knows every line
id10301_hX6LjjVtnGs_00002.flac	dead named got three because we never thought we'd come over to another movie and then um be merry decided to do the bid game and uh and then said
id10301_rXRbmL7nzIo_00001.flac	the point where she realizes that the past is gone and she has to move on and i'm part of that
id10301_rXRbmL7nzIo_00002.flac	for thirty years of people are putting on the jumpsuits and making the backpacks and turning their cars into
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00001.flac	you know the world can be difficult but i just had a very amazingly blessed
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00002.flac	so i don't know what that has to do you know the hardest thing i think it's trying to
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00003.flac	time to do something and you and i'm very good i can really disciplined myself and i and i'll trim down and i'll drop
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00004.flac	with three or four nights in a role you know it's gonna you know so i didn't really um because i had responsibilities
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00005.flac	you know association frenchie just kinda like now we have
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00006.flac	uh i don't see is not that important men i love the part of but you know because the studio has made choices that somehow i left went out of it
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00007.flac	i don't just sit in a year when we make the other goes i know they're gonna call me i don't know
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00008.flac	but uh the movie was never really meant to be more cells movie i think the movie seen to be
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00001.flac	we followed the lives of four basic characters jack black in robin's simon and polish driver as their stories intertwine during the geopolitical chaos trying to avert world war three i play the president julian the
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00002.flac	the first and the next first latino president on tv but it's a comedy it's kind of a black comedy
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00003.flac	i think my whole life i've been thinking about what it would be like to be a president i mean i i grew up
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00004.flac	and who i believe was the last truly kind of independent president that we've had everybody else seems
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00005.flac	other interests beholding that they're beholden to so i look at him as a let you know
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00006.flac	the movies more than the average american we consumed their product beyond our numbers yet were represented and far below our numbers and when we are represented we're not always represented well so we thought well how do you change that and you change that in my
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00007.flac	in their fields of expertise and we wanna help them by not only raising money to help them finish their pieces but uh also
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00008.flac	to help connect them to the industry the industry's always looking for the right people to connect their projects and people of this background are kind of under represented in in the producerial stuff so we want to help
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00009.flac	connect people to the market place that will use them in hopefully that will change the the landscape because if the folks behind the scenes understand who we are and are made up of us i think they'll be less likely to stereotype
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00010.flac	because you know we can all just work for ourselves in our individual success but i think if we all succeed it it's a sweeter success
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00011.flac	what good is having a freedom if someone else doesn't what good is having wealth next to someone who's a starving
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00012.flac	dictate that you can not only take care of yourself and be self reliant but if you really
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00013.flac	you can make sure of the people around you are not in unnecessary need i don't believe in giving people everything they want for free and for no effort i believe at helping people
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00014.flac	you were started to your family and your friends who always believe in it
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00015.flac	do this you can do this but when you get to hold everybody wants to be a start everybody wants to be successful and all of a sudden you feel like just a tiny pebble on a very big beach so you have to figure out a way to stand out you have to figure out a way to do
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00016.flac	without kind of overstepping your bounds you only pay attention and see what others do that work and that doesn't work we have to learn from our mistakes
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00017.flac	keep at it if you keep at anything you will eventually become better if it's what's your men to do
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00018.flac	now if it's not working and you don't have passion for it s okay find another job but if you have a use for this
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00019.flac	so they say in spanish there's joy while you're doing your craft it's not about the money it's not about the fame it's about knowing you were doing what you were born
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00020.flac	once in a while i wonder is it all worth it because you know we get a high and we get low what you focus out there i think is a very successful person sometimes is the person whose insecure about their next move sometimes you work and work and work and all of a sudden for a month the fan doesn't ring and you're like wait a minute but i've done all this stuff so there's no guarantee you know
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00021.flac	i just think okay once i make my first big movie they'll discover me and they'll see that i was you know it'll be easier yes it's
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00022.flac	it's not that and it shouldn't be that what happens as you figure out that the
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00023.flac	the destination learning how to love what you do whether or not it pays off right away will keep you able to do it a lot longer and chances are the long you do it the better your answer
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00024.flac	just nothing like it because it it really combined it was a synthesis of americana rock and roll latinos and
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00025.flac	took itself to another level because of all the talent they came together to make it shine and it wasn't just a success in you know audiences at home it was a success that reached a universal
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00026.flac	appeal to audiences outside of the traditional category so i was very happy to be a part of a film that let me shine that let me play a real human being not just a bad guy but a full
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00027.flac	and i was a young man i was twenty three at the time playing somebody older playing riches older brother and uh
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00028.flac	it's um it's pretty epic i gotta say i remember how the things we did the rehearsals meeting the real valencia family meeting the real bob males was a blessing
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00030.flac	when i tell people you are unique whoever you are find out what's so unique about you
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00031.flac	and that which makes you care about another person makes you care about your character you have to stay in
id10302_33L7c-DPCJQ_00001.flac	you work things out and you bring it to the set but uh we as a process
id10302_33L7c-DPCJQ_00002.flac	okay we got away with that because it's true it's not
id10302_CNPsGRmW7rY_00001.flac	elizabeth and i realized we haven't been in all three of us in the same room and almost
id10302_CNPsGRmW7rY_00002.flac	uh a few years before obama about five years exactly we shot
id10302_CNPsGRmW7rY_00003.flac	was the lighter side of balmoral amara was the dark side
id10302_D6gaRV0xtf8_00001.flac	like come on you can do better so the same i asked for the people out there don't be
id10302_K2IuvkS1s38_00001.flac	as covered basically i mean he's practically like a cooperative who has to get the mission done but uh cannot afford to
id10302_K2IuvkS1s38_00002.flac	i sometimes will tell you too much so that you don't understand what is that it's not real
id10302_K2IuvkS1s38_00003.flac	there there's there's something to miss in this information and cisco is the opposite
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00001.flac	i mean sales and you're watching amuse actually you are amused
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00002.flac	pointing out that i'm still rather young in my career relatively uh it feels like i'm about to die in the first lifetime achievement award i got was
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00003.flac	but uh i got over that real quick and um i'm just looking forward to looking back because i don't do that a lot i i when people asked me what's your favorite job you've ever done i go the one i'm about to do next
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00004.flac	one that's gonna put my kid through a school another year to one's gonna make sure you know we're okay we can save up some money up
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00005.flac	and a career and i'm blessed to be able to do something that i love doing that can also feed my family you know that that to me is the ultimate blessing i i have passion
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00006.flac	the one i'm about to do next one that's gonna put my kid through a school another year the one's gonna make sure you know we're okay and we can save up some money
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00007.flac	around eighteen years giving out awards uh is acknowledging me as a major honor because they're an international organization they're about diversely they're about the human condition human rights and
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00008.flac	unity one of the films the film that they're opening the festival with its called lost bird is a collaboration between an armenian and turkish filmmakers so that's a huge step that's like an israeli palestinian collaboration that's like you know a collaboration between north and south cards
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00009.flac	communities that have been traditionally opposed to each other coming together to to create beauty and art that makes us feel better about what you know being alive that is what i'm about so that this organization is honoring me and they have those goals and values
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00010.flac	saw us on film we were you know the bad guys were the guys to kill we were the guys the good guys to you know do away with and use
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00011.flac	and it's sad i felt it then the film i did before that that put me on the map was bad voice with shape and i played the main bad guy there and even though i played the main bad guy in bomba there was a difference with alabama because we were all shown a three dimensional we were human beings not just hate for not just people to to you know want your hero to vanquish
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00012.flac	the character that i played had so many dimensions and facts
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00013.flac	you felt for him he wasn't just a bad guy you felt his pain you want to you know knock him upside the head a few times but you also want to take him and hug him and say you mean something to and i think that's what a lot of people need a lot of people in this world you know fall through the cracks
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00014.flac	and they just don't get appreciated they don't get the love that you know they felt they deserved whether from their parents or from their
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00015.flac	or coworkers you know that's why you get people going postal quoting because they don't feel loved they don't feel appreciate they don't feel like they're connected to the human race and if that's the case then there's no love lost and they act out you know something
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00016.flac	i'm grateful i'm excited and and i'm looking forward to reminding people that you know
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00017.flac	i see more which is good but you know you gotta remember even from the ads when obama came out they said oh yeah i was gonna be a wave they called the no wave but what do we know about waves they come and they go and we just need need to make sure we're more than just
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00018.flac	you know we're not a temporal presence in this country we buy we over indect in consumption of entertainment products whether it's television whether it's internet we out spend
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00019.flac	um our own percentages yet we are very very marginally
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00020.flac	to this day so that says to me that while we've come along way we still have a long way to go so that we reach something near paris
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00021.flac	well especially since the election of the first african american president you see how corporate commercials have changed now they have black you know african american
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00022.flac	now you have mixed families being not such a big deal i mean i've watched commercials and i'm realizing how we've evolved so i hope the same goes for us i hope it
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00023.flac	we get a president for people to actually put us in leads in movies and and storylines are commercials anymore
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00024.flac	but that they realize that we are part of their family that we are as american as anyone else matter of fact maybe even more american because
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00025.flac	our ancestors come from the americas as well as from europe so we have this continent within us so when people talk about
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00026.flac	you know what those are americans too they're central americans they're south americans and their north americans mexico is in north america so let's watch how we treat people that aren't quota
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00027.flac	because they are american and they're human beings and they just want to live and feed they're
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00028.flac	like everybody else so i don't wanna mention any edits
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00029.flac	poking at us productively getting a lot of attention in return for it but not getting enough pushback and that's why i was at a rally a few weeks ago with uh father copan and lose at the show
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00030.flac	we do not accept this we're gonna take your slings and arrows and instead of get angry and fight back and go
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00031.flac	the root things we can say we're gonna take those arrows and create bridges and letters and rise above the occasion and we're gonna kill our enemies with kindness and show them that you know what you do not define
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00032.flac	well i just did something that aired on blue bloods a little a little something just to test the waters there and i just finished taping something for most in the jungle which is a wonderful show i very much like the kind that we need to see where guy got to see who's a brilliant mexican actor is the lead he plays a conductor very much like dudamel who uh in this episode goes back to mexico is you know our
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00034.flac	political leaders and things that are to me a warm welcome away from the rapist

id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00036.flac	we come in all kinds sizes shapes colors and attitudes
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00037.flac	it's hard you know have to doing this for thirty five years to find a new angle on some of these archetypes but then that's good that's a challenge you know i'm the kind of person that uh you know after bristling at at at an unexpected barrier then i'm like wait hang on that can
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00038.flac	because that which does not kill you makes you stronger and we have to teach our young people that the barriers that they face as daunting as they are are blessings and dis guys cause once you
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00039.flac	i was at a time went viral i um i was there shooting a a a short a little a little piece for someone else a young filmmaker and um as i was
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00040.flac	you know i said hey man you get your name at eastside lakeside love it and it was yeah you wanna buy it and i'm like sure you know so we were just joking in that level but then he said here's the keys and then we say let's get a picture this and then we said hey just run with this just just don't say anything for a little while and see if people buy it and they did and i was getting congratulations
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00041.flac	even after we we we exposed that it was just a self made hooks and you know part of me thinks i m maybe i should
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00001.flac	center are rarely the center of the story we were rarely pivotal and i always felt like we were flavoring
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00002.flac	and at latino cause you want a flavor flavor and just a touch never enough more like set dressing that danger let's go to bars
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00003.flac	saying if you wanna send a message go to western union well i got a message for that mentality every
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00004.flac	let's find them let's look for them and direct them is it good for us or is it bad for and if it's bad for us and just
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00005.flac	so you know we gotta be really conscious about what is out there and support
id10302_Ls9NUpj2les_00001.flac	to so much cats you gonna put people who live there for thousands and
id10302_OMw6_X2IDvE_00001.flac	human beings and especially people with culture class and the heart like the person community
id10302_OMw6_X2IDvE_00002.flac	much more than is always you know then is appreciated in the media
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00001.flac	uh as a result of my relationship with risotto green who was a three time recipient of our scholarship from the national panic foundation for the arts is a foundation that we do in dc we have a yearly a fundraiser to raise money to help kids were
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00002.flac	selling in their schools have certain ie schools you have to hide in a high enough grade point average and if you write to us and tell us why do you want our help we we hand out scholarships the then change your life scholarships
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00003.flac	so i uh i remember who came up to me
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00004.flac	i got the script it's almost ready um it's based on a true story and i wrote it with you in mine and at that point
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00005.flac	what are you most of the time you get these things and it's you know nice try but you know come back next
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00006.flac	i read this and i said wow i mean i i i really i was upset that
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00007.flac	you know it's kinda like i wanted to see more because i felt like i was looking at something i did not have access to all
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00008.flac	you know the inner workings of a family with an issue you know with sexuality
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00009.flac	and you know what the funny thing is that that you can make so many analogies he went into one prison but he was still imprisoned by his belief that
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00010.flac	till imprisoned by his attitudes his unevolved attitudes towards his child
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00011.flac	uh you know he's he's put everything he has into it and and it shows it's at
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00012.flac	uh he went to in film school with uh spike as a as a mentor
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00013.flac	and you know go crazy and like you know be the biggest cheerleader but they will keep themselves
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00014.flac	it and that's what i love about the script nobody's a real bad guy in this movie you don't need
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00015.flac	cause everybody's trying to help each other to no end and wrote to us
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00016.flac	from being laughed at and spit upon because when you're a latin kid that's what your parents tell you you don't be like
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00017.flac	with the fact that you know here i am a person was very modern very suppose you
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00018.flac	i don't think any of us are anyone all the way i know so many gay conservative republicans you know i thought how does that work
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00019.flac	be a certain way and their sexuality is like and
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00020.flac	you know it shouldn't define their politics so what i loved is being all
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00021.flac	but people have a certain desire to be a certain way
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00022.flac	and their sexuality is is like and you know it shouldn't define their politics so what i loved is being all progressive and understanding
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00023.flac	and i love to drag queens is my
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00024.flac	used to always had a great banter they always have the best returns there then that will set you track so i have an affinity i loved the movie priscilla queen of the desert i thought it was brilliant those actors at the more straight i believe did a great job but that wouldn't have worked in this
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00025.flac	by this movie i thought i was already there i thought you know
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00026.flac	it's like i tell people no one scene does this movie no one can describe it completely
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00027.flac	got ripped out because you know these people love each
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00028.flac	that i not do new york italian i'm not playing a cop so you know i sound like a white blue
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00029.flac	the deepest darkest box and i absorbed the city vibe the bible uh another surprise was just
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00030.flac	if you also go the other way with that it could be unintentionally dreary and depressing we don't want that so this is a real tight rope work and i was surprised pleasantly surprised by just how
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00031.flac	uh harmonies performance was uh you know cause we cut around certain things and we used the best and man you would think she's been acting for a while and it doesn't matter you just fall in love with that beautiful face incredible
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00032.flac	has been like oh my god i had no idea i thought i was walking into another kind
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00033.flac	making a little low ladies and like the white people get people back
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00034.flac	what did they not like the movie and i walk in and i see eighty percent of the
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00035.flac	that after all this technology all this time i suppose evolving into an incredible you know a human race that can do
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00036.flac	one of our first reviews at sundance which was incredible to standing ovation sold out every time
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00037.flac	and they have a large gains but when they were cheering and screaming and then a reviewer gave us a snarky revised it we were swimming in a see of cliches well obviously they
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00038.flac	were no cuts at all says are based on reality yeah we have a lot of people in jail yeah we have a lot of
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00039.flac	yeah we have a lot of machismo but you know doesn't know how to
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00040.flac	that's a cliche but it's like saying you know a love story is a cause a man in love it the woman at a time as we seen that before
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00041.flac	really watched the film maybe they resented the audience's reaction and they had to give it up
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00042.flac	they must have gone to the bathroom for three quarters of based on what was written
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00001.flac	first of all when i read the script i knew i had to be in the movie this was good
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00002.flac	another big star will take it and make it about his background
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00003.flac	i was just flabbergasted i was floored because i saw a chance to show our family a latin family in all
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00004.flac	way so that character was not my first choice i was more interested in jimmy
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00005.flac	within a short amount of time in the center of the piece but i felt it was a wonderful way for me
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00006.flac	my talent or energies to this movie and i i i'm not i don't
id10302_YQCymlcowOg_00001.flac	no seriously i i i would love to tell you but he's gonna go through what i would
id10302_YQCymlcowOg_00002.flac	like so many tries they all have their own dialect
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00001.flac	and it's time that good hearted people everywhere you know gave credit to those networks and programs
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00002.flac	as it's like you know it really that they're like your children especially when you don't have other children and you learn a lot about yourself and your temper and your ability to be patient
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00003.flac	degree dogs really try your patience but you know it's a good thing cause after a while you learn maybe should all my dog all the time you know maybe i should be nicer to him cause sometimes you're busy and you get all caught up
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00004.flac	you know my dog will run up on people i like put his knows where it doesn't belong um put pause on like nice
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00005.flac	but i realize that they're very sensitive and subtle creatures they could hear the different in a change of tone so i don't have
id10302__wzYMUt91gc_00001.flac	we don't wanna hear where their food comes from what a great thing that a movie actually deals with his head on not only what we do to the animals but
id10302__wzYMUt91gc_00002.flac	clever not you over the head too much way how we are not very different at least the people in that industry are not very
id10302__zm31vf2P7U_00001.flac	yeah well the thing is my guy is a is a good bad guy a bad good guy he's a kind of person that means well but unfortunately didn't make the right
id10302__zm31vf2P7U_00002.flac	to la for some of the things in his life and his wife maybe having an affair and his son
id10302__zm31vf2P7U_00003.flac	it's uh i i don't wanna give away too much but it is very harrowing to figure out
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00001.flac	you know uh dvr if possible because you're gonna wanna go
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00002.flac	it's just wonderful to have entertainment that doesn't talk down to it
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00003.flac	and it's just so kind of like the lowest common denominator entertainment it's so refreshing to be on
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00004.flac	a storyline and and the implications of of what what it is
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00005.flac	so fifty eight or so i know some people are saying wait a minute about the age but there's an answer for
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00001.flac	he he's a representative of not only how much we love our artists but as latin men how strong
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00002.flac	oh yes he and his son i mean what a beautiful man and uh and incredible following as well so we are proud of all the nominees and especially stands
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00003.flac	it's like you've made it you know uh it it really it takes you to another level the fact that
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00004.flac	and people's uh you know is collections that that spanish
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00005.flac	were we used to be the followers and now we are contributing at such a rate that it is amazing and it is and makes
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00006.flac	we really have suffered a lot as a as a nation because we're like a dysfunctional diaspora family that doesn't know each other well enough i never knew said his until i came to last
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00007.flac	and uh driving i've got two wonderful projects coming out i hate to be the director
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00008.flac	and africa but uh the fact that the matter is edward james almost did an amazing job and uh
id10302_n5Ffz_qwr58_00001.flac	he sees all the the mistakes all the all the all the falls that you take the usually see you know the good stuff and that's great but i got to say it hasn't been
id10302_n5Ffz_qwr58_00002.flac	rely on his ethnicity but he has it there with him
id10302_n5Ffz_qwr58_00003.flac	who you are you know the the tans we were the all purpose ethnic family on that
id10302_y5j-ZhbwDwE_00001.flac	and money out of politics every person who runs should get the same
id10303_CEzOEV3DiU4_00001.flac	we have all kinds of roses we all share that but we don't show what

id10303_VCEs8oAQAiM_00017.flac	you don't have to memorize it and you don't have to use
id10303_VCEs8oAQAiM_00018.flac	um think about where you're gonna be or anything you just
id10303_VCEs8oAQAiM_00019.flac	you know in one of the few that does this when i'm walking down the street and i see a woman uh in a beautiful parish shoes i'll stop and i'll say oh those shoes are beautiful

id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00002.flac	jenny and and uh she's absolutely of course amazing she's an amazing actress an amazing woman and i've been a huge fan of dance form
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00003.flac	so getting a chance to kind of work with her and i did get a chance to work with her in one session
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00004.flac	in the studio and i did get a chance to work with diana though it was really odd i was in trona she was in los angeles so she was on a monitor in her in my studio i could see her on a tv
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00005.flac	and she could see me in a tv monitor and her studio and it was the one session when we got a chance to do scenes together and it was really quite amazing for a number of reasons one is just watching her work and you're seeing them
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00006.flac	the greatest time watching finding dory i think a lot well first
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00007.flac	it's dry and it's marlon and there there back you know in a big way and
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00008.flac	you know the same i i think you know the same sense of adventure that uh that the story kind of uh told in finding uh nemo
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00009.flac	is pretty much there in spades in finding story you know uh there there are some amazing adventures funny and terrifying
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00001.flac	don't get along with my my daughter from my first marriage but but the daughter from my first marriage
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00002.flac	yeah my my second wife and the same with my mother who played
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00003.flac	caught up in this uh ponzi situation that leads to the whole witness protection
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00004.flac	a thing but you know as a as a as a dad i don't think i'm a disciplinarian
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00005.flac	that's one of the problems with this family that is for me i'm just not strong enough or i should be and i'm not
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00006.flac	made in that in that sense of you know discipline and and and do you know i had some excentric
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00007.flac	you know it was fun hanging around them much of the way it's fun hanging around made but we didn't get the same sense of
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00001.flac	i definitely was a fan of finding nemo i thought it was one of the great animated feature
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00002.flac	was just it was funny it was hard warming i thought the voice that alan brought to the character was quite amazing and
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00003.flac	uh what brought me to do uh they asked me to do it and i said yes before i could even hear the rest of them
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00004.flac	but it was the finding nemo
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00005.flac	in serious you know psychiatric sessions to to kind of
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00006.flac	i was fascinated by what they did with the face
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00007.flac	because the the character the animated character doesn't look any fortunate
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00008.flac	um its own distinctive kind of character i didn't recognize
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00009.flac	kind of in my career and that that i thought was really quite amazing
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00010.flac	oh and i was i i i just think that animation is so brilliant what those
id10304_CaR6c7RO7Dc_00001.flac	a sex office you know avoid it but um you know that is gonna happen
id10304_CaR6c7RO7Dc_00002.flac	on uh your own experience but i can't say that's true because you know i never really quite got to that
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00001.flac	it is a legitimate
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00002.flac	we looked up in several phone books and found
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00003.flac	in different cities and then in several countries so you know our argument was if you're interviewing somebody let's say on your news broadcast and you're a super ing people that you are interviewing on the air and their name happens to be
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00004.flac	on the you know cover which is they couldn't argue against the fact that this is a person's name we have a right to you know to use that as the title it's the name of the family that founded the
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00005.flac	first successful comedy show sitcom not comedy show sitcom that this country
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00006.flac	the audience without it being the real name certainly not an impression he was not doing an impression of low
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00007.flac	because there are no boundaries you can you can kind of go where you wanna go creatively and if the audience wants to go with you
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00001.flac	the most appropriate name for our show our show is about a wealthy wealthy family who lose
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00002.flac	uh so they lose and they they they bought a town when they had
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00003.flac	sixteen year old son as a birthday present and and uh the reason we bought it as a joke was because the town was called hits creek and now that they've lost everything the only the only place they can actually afford
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00004.flac	the show and my daughters are also on the show playing the waitress and dan my son
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00005.flac	well it's a different way to go i mean an improvised movie like these movies where we kind of have a written outline and uh but we don't write the dialogue uh is a is a very very fun way to shoot a movie because you just don't know what's going to happen in front of the camera we don't have any rehearsals uh so it's always fun
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00006.flac	to to improvise and you always use kind of improvisation in
id10304_GbpCKIcUyGA_00001.flac	second city shows it was like mid seventies when we saw our first shogo show and there was there was we noticed a big
id10304_GbpCKIcUyGA_00002.flac	scenes um i i wasn't i i i i i and i thought well how can they do a scene this long kind of with very few laughs and yet there
id10304_GbpCKIcUyGA_00003.flac	uh the lake the late great gillian and and uh so we did
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00001.flac	well it was i was excited about the prospect of doing scenes with stifler's mom and of course it turned out to
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00002.flac	you know as much fun as i uh as i knew what would be yeah for me it was
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00003.flac	you know the the the uh when when i kind of realized where the where the story was going once i found out i just i mean to me that was like you know finally i get to
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00004.flac	and it worked so well between the chemistry was brilliant you guys were in ninety m a little earlier on and it was very very funny because there was a group of guys downstairs in
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00005.flac	something i mean there's something charming about hearing when people when jim's dad when people go
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00006.flac	because those were done uh after we thought there was gonna be no more theatrical american pies uh and lo and behold we hear there is gonna be another one and that's american reunion
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00007.flac	if this works uh for the studio and they're quite happy with it i mean i wouldn't be shocked if they decide to go for another one but you know something tells me
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00008.flac	you know i mean if i was a betting man i guess i i i might say this could be
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00009.flac	well it's not it's not that it's not really that difficult but i understand why why it's still shocking to people because that's the the personality of the movie i think you know the if you can't be shocked by an american
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00001.flac	lord levy i think that's pretty no it's pretty it's pretty amazing it was
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00002.flac	you know it was it was a great day it uh i've never been prouder uh to be me
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00003.flac	metal around my neck i said i feel more like the court jester than than that
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00004.flac	um you know because everybody there is just you know they have uh uh uh they're accomplishments are just you know amazing and i you know i'm i'm like a character guy
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00005.flac	so i uh yeah i feel like uh what am i doing here you know really but it it was it was a pretty amazing i'll tell you what the most amazing thing about this
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00006.flac	at the black tie dinner after the event uh and i'm sitting beside the governor general's wife and he's at the next table and uh just as they're about to serve the area for the dinner i feel a kidney
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00007.flac	we couldn't have been sweeter and they could have been more helpful and uh and then the night ended okay it was uh you know but but you know i said well this this this can't happen a lot here and they said no
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00008.flac	and i'm thinking okay this i've had them before and it's like you know and now i've got at what point do
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00009.flac	uh the government general's wife that this is what's going on because at a certain point if it comes on really strong
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00010.flac	you're gonna be carried out you you won't be able to walk out of the room so i i i said i i'm thinking okay and now it's getting bad but it wasn't getting worse so i made it through the whole dinner i didn't need a thing that was the sad part it was a good looking
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00011.flac	uh and i told her after the dinner and then she was you know she was very fun she said oh well you know we'll we'll find something i said i may need some prescription drugs tonight in ottawa it's late to you guys have any pull in the
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00012.flac	honestly it's not so much reflecting on your career it's it's it's i i can't believe i'm here that's that's all i'm thinking

id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00025.flac	i i i just i i just i'm i'm you know i i've always had a very low key kind of approach to just about everything although when you're younger everything is more important
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00026.flac	yeah wonder why he got that job and i didn't get it and all that kind of stuff and now i really don't you know
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00027.flac	bother me quite so much i mean i'm i'm fortunate that you know i'm now in a position where if i don't really wanna do

id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00029.flac	i am it's it's it's it's harder now to find stuff then

id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00031.flac	and i you know i did i did go through those meetings in my younger days where you walk into a room and there's somebody there who really doesn't know anything you know about you and they're asking you
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00032.flac	kind of putting to sleep now i just you know i just say uh excuse me can i interrupt you for one second could you
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00033.flac	put in front of him but by the you know honestly when when when when the when the camera starts rolling uh he may get to two or three of these scripted questions and the rest he just goes with it
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00034.flac	is the one of the great creations of all time and it's amazing how fast and how
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00035.flac	not gonna kind of get the same given take you may not necessarily get what you're expecting from the people that you're working with and i've had some
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00036.flac	pretty scary like you know fingernails on a chalkboard
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00037.flac	scary kind of experiences where where uh you're just not a lot but but a couple that that you just wouldn't wanna go through
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00038.flac	but but you know mostly mostly have been very i really have been very lucky i've worked with people that are great that are smart that are funny that that you know they're always working at the top of
id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00039.flac	and that's how it first kind of came up and when john and i actually sat in his hotel room one day in edmonton watching us
id10304_Okaw5vJCGCk_00001.flac	this one improvising is encouraged and and you know you start we've got a great script started off with
id10304_PgZsH9ijC3Y_00001.flac	he was was just hard on the idea right from the very beginning and they they had made a very conscious choice to kind of make a ninety degree turn and kinda go more cable uh
id10304_PgZsH9ijC3Y_00002.flac	i i i mean i i watch his work i think he's amazing
id10304_PgZsH9ijC3Y_00003.flac	this was all unfolding since we started working together because we had never worked together before so i'm kind of seeing
id10304_U5YB7fT0We4_00001.flac	i believe it or not we have had like a lot of disagreements
id10304_U5YB7fT0We4_00002.flac	now that we we were both nominated for best actor for the canadian screen awards that we just had
id10304_W-5dGkFnQxM_00001.flac	like forward moving forward moving forward moving and it's only once you sort of sit down for a second and look back
id10304_WBN84VSZbIQ_00001.flac	i was competing with my son for i was up for best actor in a comedy series my son dan was also
id10304_WBN84VSZbIQ_00002.flac	what do you how do you feel about being appears i said i have no idea if this is like for me i'm obviously rooting for my son because you know i'm a dad
id10304_WBN84VSZbIQ_00003.flac	to see my kids working in a scene with catherine is totally
id10304_WBN84VSZbIQ_00004.flac	that we're just gonna be there longer than we originally thought we were so life has to go on and it's
id10304_Wab8UZNYhM0_00001.flac	we created these amazing characters that have now gotten us into the fourth installment here right
id10304_Zjzoo3L9Oto_00001.flac	physical attributes to be a tom hanks kind of leading
id10304_Zjzoo3L9Oto_00002.flac	part of this tonight and and delighted to have been a part of a splash the movie
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00001.flac	we we set out to make uh dane and my son dan we set out to make a show that well
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00002.flac	ability and and we we kinda did that and our sensibility really is
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00003.flac	as a fly on the wall and all of a sudden the money has gone so that was
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00004.flac	the you know are great writers and dan's doing a great job running room now
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00005.flac	in this town now which means more interaction with the town's people and i think that's all the characters in their own
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00001.flac	well it was uh it was a pretty exciting thing when we
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00002.flac	and uh and it was uh you know when when when when i finally got to hear what the story was how the characters were kinda moving along and what what uh john and hating the writer directors had indeed
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00003.flac	for this uh i got very excited you know when i cause i thought their their their story the way they were lying in that was was very
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00004.flac	and kind of fresh so it was uh it was a lot of fun
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00005.flac	for this uh i got very excited you know when i cause i thought they're there
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00006.flac	well it was it was fantastic i mean one one of the great things was knowing i was gonna be doing scenes with with jennifer with stifler's mom and getting jim's dad and stifles together was just i thought just a an amazingly
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00007.flac	and and and you know we we have a hand and arm
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00008.flac	and um and it was just kind of fun on the set and it was uh for them
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00009.flac	i thought it was just a really interesting way to go and stepping outside of what we
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00010.flac	brilliant aspects of the script was was making jim's dad a widower because it did open up a lot of different you know avenues here and one was that it is
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00011.flac	enabled jim and his dad to kind of you know have
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00012.flac	so that was you know i thought that was um that was pretty amazing and you know quite
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00013.flac	the scene i shot in this movie was in back in the bedroom with jim
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00014.flac	like i was doing the original american pie everything was the same the wallpaper the theme
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00015.flac	you know everything in that room was i was identical to the way it was back then so i i was uh it was kind of a spooky experience
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00016.flac	it doesn't happen a lot in one's career and uh to hit on something to be associated with
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00001.flac	very well because i didn't get to work with them at all so i didn't really get to know
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00002.flac	kick out of uh you know creating friendships with these people that i really haven't worked with before
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00003.flac	um but this this is a very funny movie and it's it was really well
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00004.flac	and can they can they make the next movie as good or better
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00002.flac	shows godspell and second city which was an institution moving to troo and you know luckily i you know i i was able to kind of make both of those shows and those those were the uh the that's the first three or four years of my uh career kind of doing shows a week which which i was really fortunate and then out of a second city theater we of course have
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00003.flac	developed and created our television show second city television which became tv and you know the rest kind of just roles
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00004.flac	now i mean i i sort of always knew that i wanted to um perform i didn't quite know in what capacity um and uh so in high school in college i was uh doing a lot of acting stuff and then got my job on mtv which was more of a hosting situation and that took about eight years
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00005.flac	took me away from the acting thing for a while and when i left mtv i got back into it and um about a year in a half into that uh i started working with my dad on this project and then a couple years later here we are so it's been
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00006.flac	well it's it's really a show about a a very wealthy
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00007.flac	lose all their money you know their business manager kinda screws them they get the their left holding the bag for years of unpaid taxes the government takes everything except um a town that they once bought as a joke and they bought it as a joke because that's the name of the township
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00008.flac	the only place they can afford to live now until they get back on their feet
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00009.flac	is uh is ships creek so it's really it's that fish out of water kind of situation but really it's about this family that never really functioned together as a family when they had money and now they're living in two adjoining hotel rooms in ships
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00010.flac	for virtually incapable human beings trying to figure out what it's like to you know
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00011.flac	great character actress so kind of you know amelia like when she does characters this uh is perhaps you know the one of her great great
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00012.flac	um performances in this role uh of more rose uh she's incredibly funny and insanely funny
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00013.flac	um and and you know and we've been it's true we've been working for years on the chris guess movies and and even you know before that go going back
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00014.flac	that i have that we're able to work together that's you know she's always the first name
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00015.flac	it's ten o'clock on pop tv um and if you wanna find your channel just head to the website pop tv com and you can put your postal code and area code and they'll tell you where to find the channel on your u on your local cable
id10304_qbrGkPrDuoU_00001.flac	with uh friends and we finished the dinner were walking out of the restaurant i remember she was walking out on
id10304_qbrGkPrDuoU_00002.flac	street with her arm around my wife she had her shoes in her hand walking down the sidewalk
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00001.flac	squeeze you know a stage piece in and we're really strapped for writing
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00002.flac	oh and a lot of times they just didn't work as well because their stage pieces and of course we when we performed them we performed them at the same energy level on stage cause that's what we were used to doing they didn't work as well but the new piece was a great television uh adaptation because uh it was it was tv that we were doing on stage and when we just put it in the show it worked pretty well i mean we started in show one and went right through the head
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00003.flac	litan edith started as a stage character
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00004.flac	i don't remember but i but i am you're clarifying this for me which is which is great so then the show went
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00005.flac	it was a nice place whatever i don't know what the point is the point is i enjoyed my house i don't know whether they're
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00006.flac	i could tell you what it was we had a pool we had a lovely chap who was living in the guesthouse i don't think you really care about
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00007.flac	i only did the shows when uh when andrew uh called me to say do you wanna come up and do and and guess on some shows but beforehand i i had no intention of going back i just thought it was pathetic
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00008.flac	this little thing but i did go up and guest for a couple of weeks and i when i got up there i i i saw how the production had been had
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00009.flac	it was amazing we never had production like this intro it was you know great direction great lighting great sets i mean it really looked dazing and once i got up there i said wow
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00010.flac	we took off you're in a bar you were you know this was we were working our asses off and they
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00011.flac	with him was was so much energy and enthusiasm that you know at this point round about the our second last season you know we were we were kinda getting tired and it was mary's energy
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00012.flac	and and and just positive vibe and attitude that kinda picked everybody up and now we had to kinda come back up
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00013.flac	yes well i was nineteen eighty one during a kind of man
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00014.flac	of the just when the original cast had left right nineteen seventy nine or something like that and the new cast came in new producer i did hear that that they wanted to put us in the saturday night eleven thirty time slot
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00001.flac	hispanic you know do have some conservative values whether it's the religion or upbringing or community um we can't deny the fact that the most of the militias are hispanic the people that are coming up which means they're young which means they've grown up with a more tolerant view of the world whether it's sexual equality marriage equality equal pay reproduction rights i mean and i'm hoping that this younger generation which tends to be largely
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00002.flac	um will help with uh with those issues that particularly we're having here in in texas so it'll be interesting i think i think you know
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00003.flac	voter education i mean just making them aware of how policies disproportionally affect them whether it's access to healthcare or access to quality education or access to um reproductive freedom um a lot of people i want to know how does this affect
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00004.flac	and i think that's all americans but specifically with this panic so we wanna make sure that there's no apathy that there uh there's true engagement and and knowing how does this affect your pocketbook at the end of the day if you vote for this canada this canada has done this in this in this or this canada has not pass this in this in this and so sometimes when you when you just break it down um into us
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00005.flac	how does this affect me why should i vote you have to have a good answer for that and that's what everybody's out out there is asking especially in this band community do it
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00006.flac	is interesting and effective because they're very grassroot oriented and i think that was the success of of being on the obama campaign and seeing their their ground operation um it really takes a dorado approach and i think that's what
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00007.flac	but fun which helped fun raised for the national election and we had such success we raised over thirty two million dollars u with over a hundred and fifty thousand donors so that's a lot of donations and a lot of people that we went to uh for donations was were people who had never been asked before and so we tapped into a whole new uh not only donor base but
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00008.flac	new community that wants to be involved and wants to have a voice um so after the national election was done we wanted to continue to harness these uh this new community that wanted to be involved and wanted to be engaged and we decided to start the let you know victory project and um it has two arms as a pack side and then there's also a charity side in which we are trying to develop a pipeline of uh leo cants who represent american values and we want to support that pipeline of
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00009.flac	that would be the golf we don't wanna have to go and target certain races to make sure that our canada's win and you know with citizens united and the amount of money being poured into certain campaigns that doesn't necessarily produce the best canada so let you know victory project is having to go and support these candidates who really represent amazing american values but who are losing or or in a really tight race because of that
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00010.flac	and so you know the ultimate dream is that we don't need a latino victory project in the
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00011.flac	whether it's sexual equality in marriage equality equal pay reproduction writes i mean and i'm hoping that this younger generation which tends to be largely
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00012.flac	um will help with uh with those issues that particularly we're having here in in texas so it'll be interesting i think i think you know
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00013.flac	voter education i mean just making them aware of how policies disproportionately affect them
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00014.flac	a quality education or access to um reproductive freedom um a lot of people want to know
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00015.flac	have a plan they have an idea of what they need and where they need to go
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00016.flac	is interesting and effective because they're very grassroot oriented and i think that was the success of of being on the obama campaign and seeing their their ground operation um it really takes a dorado approach and i think that's something
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00017.flac	but fun which helped fund raise for the national election and we had such success we raised over
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00018.flac	hispanic you know do have some conservative values whether it's the religion or upbringing or a community um we can't deny the fact that the most of the marines are hispanic the people that are coming up which means they're young which means they've grown up with
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00020.flac	with this panic so we wanna make sure that there's no apathy that there's uh there's true engagement and and knowing how does this affect your pocketbook at the end of the day if you vote for this canada this canada has done this in this in this or this canada has not pass this in this in this and so sometimes when you when you just break it down um into us
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00021.flac	how does this affect me why should i vote you have to have a good answer for that and that's what everybody's out out there asking especially in this part community do
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00001.flac	huh that i was thinking now before the idea of telenovela uh came to mind but i was a very uh big fan of uh telenovela squaring up i was in a song
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00002.flac	in my career one of the first breaks i got was young and the rest of us and i loved uh behind the scenes comedies like some dish and um thirty rock and so in the seventies with them billy crystal i mean there was all too there was so many funny things that were happening behind the scenes way funnier than what was happening in front of the cameras and so i always thought it would be funny to have a tv series
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00003.flac	where um it was behind the scenes of a of a soap but instead of a normal cooper what if it was a telenovela which is uh you know i think raises the stakes cause there are more melodramatic and they're heightened and it's the most popular one in the world and so we wanted to to celebrate it and this was like our big love
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00004.flac	thus we uh uh we definitely uh uh bring out whether it's a wind machine or a star down or slapping
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00005.flac	the stories we get our real life things that have happened uh you know there was a u s actress who would um abella actress who would randomly slap people on scenes you never knew if you were gonna get slapped um there's another woman who would get up on latters and move her own lights um and another soul no actress who's assistant was poisoning her in real life so
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00006.flac	yeah we we just kind of go oh it's just from this real
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00007.flac	so this is the first time i'm in a tree half hour sitcom comedy
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00008.flac	and of course physical i love physical comedy and when i read this script i thought oh my gosh i love i love on sophia i love where her comedy comes from which is um her insecurities
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00009.flac	um and her desperation to to wanna be more do more and be relevant and so um it was a lot of fun kind of flexing my my comedy mussels it is it is up
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00010.flac	i fell off the bed i tweaked my shoulder i banged my ne um falling off a piano i mean it it was a it was a lot of fun though because it's um aside people kind of saw a little bit of a like
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00011.flac	but you yeah a comedy is all about timing and all about the rhythm of the words and the pace of the editing and the pace of of um the camera choreography so that's why i wanted to produce the show that i was going to be in and that's why i like producing comedy is
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00013.flac	i love everything about sophia i you know what i love is she's exactly opposite of gum gas released from house wife gabby was narcissistic and confident and
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00014.flac	she's super insecure she's super fragile she needs her friends she hides behind meme um she gets herself into trouble does know how to crawl out of it and that's been so much fun
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00015.flac	unexpected um i also you know i like that she's a fish out of water in this world which kinda comes from my upbringing i i grew up in texas not speaking spanish but yet being let the eu so kind of never getting the joke or not really quite fitting in and having one foot in and one foot out and i feel like the future generations of hispanics in the united states feel that way they feel that you know i'm not as tied to my language or culture as
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00016.flac	so but i still feel like you know i still feel mexican i still feel you know connected to my culture so uh when we did focus groups of the of the pilot that was one of the number one things hispanics said was i love that he doesn't speak spanish because that i don't speak spanish but yet i am hispanic and i'm very proud of it and so it was uh interesting to see that that was about
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00017.flac	it does is really focus on on two paths for women the first being their educational journey the second
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00018.flac	hence no programs cause to start small businesses at six times national average and so they don't have access to capital they don't have access to business training so we wanna a kind of nurture that but prior to that um just getting amount of high school is a challenge you know lots in the united states are um we have the the largest
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00019.flac	the least access to higher education the least access to resources we you know the disparity
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00021.flac	family of women my mother's uh superstrong i have nine as i have three sisters so uh
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00022.flac	amazing women who were educated who had a career not a job but they had careers they had families um i was the last person of my family the master's degree so
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00023.flac	um i never like to say them because everything gets stuck in development and then people go what happened to that one but um yeah we have six projects in
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00024.flac	three dramas um you know summer late then the summer not but uh you know hopefully with the with the large amount of different distribution channels now um you will see more content
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00025.flac	distributed from my production company because i i just feel like you know i'm championing a female leads i'm championing the the community and i'm championing funny like i just want
id10307_BpIz2lAf22Y_00001.flac	absolutely and you write what you talked about earlier because i am so public and i am pretty open about about um myself and and about my marriage i was you know
id10307_BpIz2lAf22Y_00002.flac	and you go oh my god i have to deal with this and it was hard it was it was devastating
id10307_Cb07--9j3-Q_00001.flac	process was funny because i was i was the first character cast i was the first one to go in on casting
id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00001.flac	audition uh for the role of gabriel and i and it was my seventh audition of the day and i was changing in my
id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00002.flac	and then i get this was the seventh one of the day and i was like i go and i had to read her really quick and then i went into the audition
id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00003.flac	so pretty year which was eleven months of filming throughout the year so we basically had four weeks off every year um and it was uh growing i mean it was you know eighteen hour days for eleven months of the year all year around it was just so much that uh and then we had fully mind all the characters i mean i couldn't have one more affair like it
id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00004.flac	yeah i know it was so much fun but i didn't i wasn't quite prepared for the end until the last episode of shooting where they go this is the last time we'll be in this kitchen and i go

id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00006.flac	they 're bickering but with women yeah they they wanted to do that to to us all the time and we just sat back and enjoyed the ride
id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00007.flac	she's uh you know she's in this world of of this opera but it's behind the scenes my ex husband comes back uh to work with me and we hate each other it's it's a bit of war the roses and
id10307_IASj5B-pAyM_00008.flac	a housewife so if i go back to television it has to be even better and i read a bunch of stuff over the

id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00002.flac	to the people of this great nation and to see him uh you know do that today i saw a vice president uh get sworn in
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00003.flac	yes and you know there's a lot of magic happening soon state of being the first hispanic to swearing president was a big moment for us and in our communities so it's a lot of first
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00004.flac	absolutely absolutely i mean i'm trying to do my part is the citizen my part is
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00005.flac	uh hispanic and as a woman as an american so um you know i enjoy it i think everybody should shoulder
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00006.flac	civically engaged in it in a level that would affect policy that's the point that's that's our government
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00007.flac	and uh you know there was a historic mobilization uh this election with the latino vote um
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00009.flac	coming around to the idea that they're going to have to compromise with the president on on a lot of issues immigration being one of them because immigration in particular uh i think the republicans are gonna realize if you know they don't do it because it's morally imperative they have to do it because it's politically imperative and if theyre not gonna do it because it's politically imperitive they gotta do it cause it's economically imperative so there's a lot of games for everybody no matter what party of filiation to get this done and to fix this
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00010.flac	um but no uh no right now i'm i'm really i oh i've always had the powers with the citizen um i love doing what i do i think you know it's
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00011.flac	it's interesting and uh and it's all of our responsibility to be involved in the way i'm i'm involved and uh you know i'm i'm i'm not running for office
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00012.flac	clinicians do i think it's a very very big job it's it's their day job it's not my day job so i'm just doing what i can to help uh the communities and in which
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00001.flac	uh hispanics you know do have some conservative values whether it's through religion or upbringing
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00002.flac	community um we can't deny the fact that the most of the militias are hispanic the people that are coming up which means they're young which means they've grown up with a more tolerant view of the world whether it's sexual equality marriage equality equal pay a reproduction rights i mean and i'm hoping that this younger generation which tends to be largely history
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00003.flac	um will help with uh with those issues that particularly we're having here in in texas so it'll be interesting i think i think you know
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00004.flac	voter education i mean just making them aware of how policies disproportionally affect them whether it's access to healthcare or access to quality education or access to us
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00005.flac	have a good answer for that and that's what everybody's out out there asking especially in this parent community do it
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00006.flac	a question that it it disenfranchises a certain population uh whether you're for or you're a person of color or you live in a role
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00008.flac	this documentation is recomendation so um that's what we're doing today is really going out and making sure people have a plan they have an idea of what they need and where they need to go and uh how long it will take and that they can really a lot a lot of time
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00009.flac	is interesting and effective because they're very grassroot oriented and i think that was the success of of being on the obama campaign and seeing their their ground operation um it really takes a dorado approach and i think that's something
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00011.flac	that would be the gold we don't wanna have to go and target certain races to make sure that are canada's win and you know with citizens united and the amount of money being poured into certain campaigns that doesn't necessarily produce the best canada so let you know victory project is having to go and support these candidates who really represent amazing american values but who are losing or or in a really tight race because of
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00012.flac	uh and so you know the ultimate dream is that we don't need a latino victory project in the future that uh it's a fair playing ground with people who are
id10307_hs255kxqdIA_00001.flac	socially um constructed that way to just be inferior or or subservient and you don't have to be you can be yourself and and really hold your own by yourself in no matter
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00001.flac	that's that's a question it's a big question to and and i think there's so much misinformation out there and and i
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00002.flac	the expert in this field although i am pretty literate i'm pretty literate and in this particular issue um because of of people that are in my life and my mentors and and people that i surround myself with because i really want
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00003.flac	i think created a dialogue that we needed to have and and for immigration um it's been on the administration on the agenda for th
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00004.flac	inherited a lot of problems it's not easy being the president of the nited states um you know they're disappointment because immigration reform has not been tackled i uh yes there is but people have to understand the history of emigration in our country and so a lot of the people that are speaking out about it even on on this
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00005.flac	channels they don't understand the history especially of mexicans are mexican americans
id10307_nyOSk9wr50I_00001.flac	um no it's a workplace comedy very broad i play the star of the spanish so
id10307_p_ifY8mUFBM_00001.flac	i come from a very fine topic family and my elder sister had special needs and so we were always involved in giving back and and within
id10307_p_ifY8mUFBM_00002.flac	community and community programs and so for me this was such a natural
id10307_tiC1AaHnX7A_00001.flac	yeah she was a wonderful won she is a wonderful woman um
id10307_wDlr75yk6Iw_00001.flac	like they're mine readers they're so my sisters are so good there i go i need it and then they'll hand it
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00001.flac	uh about a telenovela which is a spanish so opera so it's a workplace comedy set behind behind the scenes of a telenovela
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00002.flac	who plays the star of the spanish scope that we are behind the scenes of uh she doesn't speak spanish she's very assimilated uh but she has found herself here uh having fame and start on this spanish sopera uh she is insecure
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00003.flac	it 's a lot of fun she's clumsy uh she's funny um she realizes heavily on this workplace family um if it wasn't for these people that she works
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00004.flac	um and uh and really making walking the line of honoring them
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00005.flac	and and making sure that the size of our comedy is broad enough for everybody but specific enough to to make
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00006.flac	really was excited to discover a new talent i was excited too
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00007.flac	levi is one of my favorite human beings in the world as well he i love alive we've known each
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00008.flac	since before a desperate housewife he was on a show called less than perfect and i was on
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00009.flac	on abc and we've known each other you know since then i became fast friends and long time
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00010.flac	and when we had this role um we thought oh my gosh you know would be great exactly and he was told that he was like yeah
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00011.flac	he plays the president of the spanish network and he's a white guy who speaks
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00012.flac	and i play on sophia who is the star of the spanish so who does not speak
id10307_x5H4xfXTh-I_00001.flac	i mean doesn't mean i'll answer it yeah but i but yeah i learn that parents how to put it
id10307_x5H4xfXTh-I_00002.flac	always talked about the drama behind the scenes but they never they would never do that about a show about men
id10307_xypgI0Y-bFA_00001.flac	um i'm i was surprised there was even a trial in that it went that far because i love nicole and i love mark cherry and i love
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00001.flac	my name because it changed so many times and we never used the name jill we called each other in cause that's my last name was jill
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00002.flac	um agent i mean sorry agent means it changes like agent marine that's what they called me to always forget my name was dumb
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00003.flac	is uh a rocky secret service agent who was assigned to keeper and on her first day underneath keeper there's a scandal that breaks out that there's a mole in the secret service
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00004.flac	a little bit yeah i was excited to venture away from desperate housewives for a movie a um and specifically early on in our desperate housewives a phenomenon i wanted to kind of branch out before people could only see me as gary and i think this movie does that
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00005.flac	it's extremely hard um this year i'm having a difficult time trying to fit in a movie um because our hates gets shorter and shorter as we're doing more and more episodes and we have more and more countries to um you know or two and so it's really been difficult but you know i'm not complaining my life is just
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00006.flac	that a girl out shot but you know women in general are better shooters because they have a calmer and they don't have the deal that the men do but you know i grew up
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00007.flac	i just really comfortable with it and i think it's important in movies like this that you sell it um that you sell the fact that you're comfortable and you are that person you have gone through that training cause you can tell right away
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00008.flac	the character that um she not use her looks together way and that she is respected for her skill in her talent and and it is because we got to meet a lot of secret service agents that are currently
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00009.flac	employed and the it is tough it is a tough tough job and you don't get anywhere
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00010.flac	you know only the best of the best will survive in this organization and so um to play it any other way it would be a disservice
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00011.flac	um well like i said i'm a rookie and i'm a sin to keeper who's not really happy about it at the beginning until he discovers i'm actually um beneficial to have around because he can't trust
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00012.flac	the movie while he's solving this mystery except for me because i'm not dated and i'm untainted by any influence so he learns to trust me and then i also studded with michael
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00013.flac	in my back story you know that i've actually uh highly respect who michael's character was so i'm kind of cat in the middle because they're not seeing my own things and i'm trying to keep peace through the movie and and and really expose the truth of what
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00014.flac	and it's just high action you want you
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00015.flac	you you can't stop thinking and and wondering i'll say you can't trust anybody you know you might think it's me you might think it's michael you think it's keeper so you don't know who it is
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00016.flac	and very flattering as you know because i grew up as the ugly duckling and and
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00001.flac	well i think because there are opposites in some senses because he's someone who's always worried he's always his his brain is always in conflict and that comes across when you read the books it's sort of it's almost tiring because he never stops thinking about he's really conscientious and he has to like her mind he tells me is a saving person thing and he does and where really goes with the flow you know she's where everyone's worried about being
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00002.flac	she can do to stop um the events she just enjoy them and um she i think she helps her came down and realize he can
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00003.flac	dad as you know files and it's just so much fun being part of the love a good plan i think um and being being learn you sometimes feel like your the outside or just something that goes with her but when it was with her dad i felt really relaxed
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00004.flac	different it's not like any of the ones before because they're not a hurt anymore and the sense that it's it's the seventh book so and this was the big question when the book came out will harry livery and that's the thing in the film you
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00005.flac	it there's no dumbledore the theses are gone there's no one to protect them and you have that sense that they're these teenagers out in the world and the
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00006.flac	and i can't really get my old pictures in the head but the ones who i'm friends with that they they in in the book they they're not there
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00001.flac	i think he's a little bit self conscious you know and everyone's against him in the fifth book and he doesn't want
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00002.flac	by her and she she's wise she is really good insight into people
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00003.flac	because she doesn't have any friends and then when she heard she likes harry you know and then
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00004.flac	doing this she wanted to go like to learn the magic but also to make friends you know she likes she's not alone although she's
id10308_Tzs_CTbHT9Y_00001.flac	kind of the i don't know no one likes me i'm the very like
id10308_We7oIBrKQKg_00001.flac	yeah i learned from her that by by having that by not worrying you save yourself a lot of trouble
id10308_We7oIBrKQKg_00002.flac	they don't do anything they're trying to protect us from from failing what they
id10308_We7oIBrKQKg_00003.flac	and she's she's too much out one with herself that she doesn't need to so um and people just like always asking like how do gonna be
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00001.flac	almost a little bit i was a little bit at first if that's a bit you know i don't but i i i i think coming back here when i like that was before i came back and when we came back here two days ago and and i saw and met the people who are running it i'm just i'm really happy now but this and i'm happy that it's it's become a studio or so that it's always gonna be there it's not like packing boxes and it's not like it never
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00002.flac	it's like listen it's the home of harry potter which is such a nice thing and we've also we've seen some of the people coming through
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00003.flac	and their reactions are just amazing and and so rewarding and it's like it's almost
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00004.flac	yeah absolutely am walking through the great hall especially there's i remember all the scenes i had i did with friends and and like
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00005.flac	and i love those scenes when everyone came back cause most of my scenes were they like just what done or what the
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00006.flac	the members six of them but these ones are always everyone
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00007.flac	i love the creature shop and i think from a favorite in the creatures
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00008.flac	the fenix and he's really really beautiful and am yeah he just
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00009.flac	he's so cool and um i just think they've taken all his personality and his his interests into account when they felt that set
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00010.flac	play the sims a lot like some race car games
id10308_igRoN6MXsWo_00001.flac	and by the fantasy and then the world that are created
id10308_igRoN6MXsWo_00002.flac	you know yeah fantasy world that that we don't experience i think it
id10308_igRoN6MXsWo_00003.flac	it's interesting it's like an escape but it's not that you relate to it and she's great
id10308_p1RiXPsSp4E_00001.flac	french and have my place but i just think at the moment it's a really good time
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00001.flac	the whole film is just towards this battle is really big and
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00002.flac	the special effects were really well with this and and three i was i was sceptical about the three defects but it works really well um and yeah
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00003.flac	but you you'll just see every every character kind of get there and get a moment and and it's surprising because there is so much to pack in but um all of the key characters i've been there throughout the series they all come into the
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00004.flac	she's gonna be wherever she's meant to be um and and and she doesn't that's what you never see her worried she's always just quite relaxed and even in the battle scenes she she'll never started sobbing hysterically cause she's always very sort of
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00005.flac	be positive and and it's the right way of thinking like who gets doesn't get anyone anywhere
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00006.flac	and i think i think she's a very spiritual character that she she else the way he she sees herself here
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00007.flac	and they don't have all this self or self hater and think that some people in our
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00008.flac	because they believe you know they're part of nature and they're perfect for that reason and that's the way luna is and that's why she's always so calm and rustin um so yeah i think faith is a big part and i think her mini jake
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00009.flac	when there's no evidence purely because there's no evidence to the contrary she just likes to keep an open mind where's her mind everything has to be like
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00010.flac	this is the whole purpose of his life is so
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00011.flac	this is the whole purpose of his life is so deeply rooted in his past and it's
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00012.flac	such a long stretch of time um and i think yeah it's just amazing he says he was the bravest man he knew that gave up his whole life
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00013.flac	like when i would put on her close it was just really colorful and and and brought it and so unlike what anyone else would wear
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00014.flac	things and and and it's it's it's a lovely it's such a relief to to not because i'm i suppose i would generally be more than her and and
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00015.flac	you're being talked about and you're worrying what are people saying um and but when i'm playing luna i don't have that
id10308_sGqnn4WpQCI_00001.flac	i was like working with he's older veteran actors but he invited them in
id10308_sGqnn4WpQCI_00002.flac	so um yeah i remember my meeting with him on fire the first time it was at my screen tips so that the parent so solid from being just terrified just like parole when he was about actually auditioned
id10308_sGqnn4WpQCI_00003.flac	he was just like it was that day was clear i ever coming in i haven't got my costume and like just
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00001.flac	i did i had two butter beers we we were on stage we were doing them alive
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00002.flac	yeah it's it's it's even worse you know because i've had this not just for the film i've had since i was eight so i mean i don't even really know what kind of person i was before i had a pattern
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00003.flac	my last stop on the harry potter tower because the premier it's really fun but you don't see a lot of your friends it's so huge and and just lots of people you don't know where
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00004.flac	and and and it was lovely because it's like i have been getting quite done about this going like some after the first
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00005.flac	experience going yeah and going through and that you can talk to someone that say how sad
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00006.flac	i did the linear design that but you know i hope that people take
id10308_sy19cFuDvX8_00001.flac	she really likes it cause because she doesn't have any friends and then when she she likes her
id10308_sy19cFuDvX8_00002.flac	doing this she wanted to go like to learn the magic but also to make friends you know she likes she's not alone although she's alone she
id10308_vbxURBaCGr0_00001.flac	for all the love you've shown to me and to all the members of the harry potter cast and um yeah i thank you for asking
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00001.flac	it's made that more clear having the park here like actually going to the world to the wizarding world and that's why people everyone sort of wants to
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00002.flac	go into acting if i hadn't been for this so it really pushed me into this and i love
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00003.flac	a little like inside it was more just the child in me playing and i didn't know how to approach a character who i was already like a
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00004.flac	really i had no connection with um so that was just kind of a kind of i did something that was
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00005.flac	small scale because i wanted to just play for and i found it
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00006.flac	changing it was uh because it wasn't and also because it was just
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00007.flac	scale projects is that you have to be so much more responsible like aware of yourself you have to look at for yourselves because they don't have the luxury of time too
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00008.flac	keep going over things and am sometimes it can come looking awful were hard
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00009.flac	like great so yeah there was a certain i felt more i had more creative freedom
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00001.flac	listen to the audio books the performances by jim dale of the american auditions of the books countless times i mean we're talking about numbers in there
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00002.flac	personal almost as someone who's been in the desert for so long and personal graves who is a smart man perceives this and is exploiting it by saying hey you in the desert here is water
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00003.flac	but graves also needs something from credence there's another
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00004.flac	that seems to be the dynamic of this mutual reliance that then starts to crumble as they both start to realize or to think that the other one does not have what they
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00005.flac	incredibly fun we had a really really wonderful time fleshing it out in rehearsal uh and realizing it on the day we really we would we were very explorative um david would give us a lot of angles to play with the scene from
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00006.flac	very attentive probably like every single person who worked on this film very attentive to try to
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00007.flac	the subtleties of the dynamic as it was written because that's the amazing thing about jake rowling's work is
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00008.flac	and they had the bullhorn and they were yelling i mean things that people
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00009.flac	image david yates is the antithesis of that image he is the opposite of all of those
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00010.flac	incredibly quiet he maintains an incredibly quiet set the focus on the work is is a really strong he's very sweet and kind and warm loving and supportive but at the same time he is a director who will challenge you and will accept nothing less than the best and most authentic performance that you're capable of that day
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00011.flac	and i accept the note and then he'd walk away and i'd go and how did he know what i was
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00001.flac	in a sense when we really love a story we all step into
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00002.flac	i don't know for me a lot of my material in this film is just conversations between two people uh a lot of the other actors has a had a lot more to sort of fill in the blanks of in their mind but i will say that what i did do
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00003.flac	to work with the visual effects department was a really collaborative and they were always trying to let us know what things would look like and they were watching our performances also to inform how they were going to make these images
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00005.flac	cause i remember on the playground two people disagree about what you're imagining you're like no money
id10309_0wLebLY6tcM_00001.flac	sort of had a moment of temporary insanity and jubilee on the street
id10309_3qX7bbJ17lY_00001.flac	i wanted to do it just seeing this like muckraking aspiring investigative radical journalist who was obsessed with
id10309_3qX7bbJ17lY_00002.flac	no ideology of putting himself as this over dramatized character that you know he
id10309_3qX7bbJ17lY_00003.flac	uh you know this power is corrupting him and what what was supposed to be a movement is becoming
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00001.flac	person because i think people are naturally
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00002.flac	level there's an awareness in a baby baby when even when a child is born that's a nine month progressed organism with
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00003.flac	removed from kind of what makes us human we're becoming less and less
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00004.flac	can can be forgiven i mean because because we can all on some level
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00005.flac	these are incredibly delicate and complex
id10309_MJ3skMKNBGM_00001.flac	uh that's that bird was yes that bird was honest with you i don't know how that bird got all that information
id10309_MJ3skMKNBGM_00002.flac	yeah i'm a huge aberfan yes was still
id10309_MJ3skMKNBGM_00003.flac	from nineteen twenty six new york some long underwear because i really like old school long underwear there's so so you can just wear them as pants you look
id10309_RWpuDFuKFjY_00001.flac	play credence barbone and he's sort of a sad character he's grown
id10309_RWpuDFuKFjY_00002.flac	city part of the enchantment so i can fit anything in there but then it is extremely
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00001.flac	uh the people in history who who might have actually had some magical
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00002.flac	getting out of control sort of falling out of line and how that's how how evolution happens on
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00003.flac	often having rather miserable lives and being rejected by society and
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00004.flac	in some cases tromping and and managing to enjoy but always outside of
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00005.flac	but it's almost like creates got mitt's got left behind or mary would
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00006.flac	what they could have been if they were never subjected to that drama is tragic and then thinking about
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00001.flac	it's somewhat like a valve remember in band class at school when the grose woodwinds that you would have to spit remember they have to let out this bit
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00002.flac	drift off and start playing with a prop were staring at
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00003.flac	the body all art is made by the body if we're a singer we're dancing with our vocal cords if we're
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00004.flac	and for me what i guess what i was interested in or what i'm becoming a more and more interested in is like a lot of times in acting we talk about setting intentions so like what is your character's motivation in this scene which is great and it's important um but for me what i'm becoming more interested in is instead of intention paying attention and paying attention to the body
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00005.flac	i know where we need you to run we have this enormous treadmill i think that's called a
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00006.flac	meets visual effects and what we're trying to implement is a wide diversity of tactics of how
id10309_VxiCsd0gA6o_00001.flac	i don't know how exciting that it would really be just be like me growing up in suburban new jersey i mean like getting some role like how did this
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00001.flac	we think we live in the coolest craziest city in the world and the most lively vibrant city in the world
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00002.flac	this city is so amazing and there's so much going on
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00003.flac	yeah it has all the energy and all the vibrant of new york but maybe not
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00004.flac	i certainly had that period i remember when i was about thirteen years old
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00005.flac	everybody had an identity everybody had these opinions
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00006.flac	and so i started to have my own opinions and i started to sort of carve out my own
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00007.flac	you know i had to pretend like i hated the music my parents like even though before then and now again now i can admit it's not
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00008.flac	good looks can only get you so far and often people don't
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00009.flac	like girls with artistic sensibility and who make art and i tend to be
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00010.flac	love or relate to someone else if you can't first love and relate to
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00011.flac	actors who trust their instincts and working with
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00012.flac	that there is nothing more important you can intellectualize and think about a character
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00013.flac	the best thing you can do is let your internal
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00014.flac	and to listen and to to pay attention to the other actors because there's a danger in thinking too much
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00015.flac	that you will ignore what's really happening and you'll miss
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00016.flac	my husband i say it all the time i say it when i'm alone you know i'll just be like you know
id10309_Zx-zA-D_DvI_00001.flac	like like a local like a fanatical i would would listen to the audio books almost every day of my life for
id10309_Zx-zA-D_DvI_00002.flac	i even like a serial ball this is like a a bull you put some sort of sauce or garnish in very
id10309_Zx-zA-D_DvI_00003.flac	connect maybe this doesn't maybe i'm just talking about it because i'm messed with
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00001.flac	an audition that involved doing an improvisation with just a couple
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00002.flac	conspiracy uh david and david hammon they came to new york and we met
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00003.flac	a miss it sort of by design and a couple diferent ways i had a breathing stutter when
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00004.flac	the opera i was beginning to ask questions about my sexuality and was
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00005.flac	kiss boys sometimes and that didn't help
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00006.flac	unity to see things uh more clearly from afar with a grand perspective but we should
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00007.flac	to that sort of invention or a creativity um and in fact makes people feel really stifled and like they have to be outside of society uh in order to express
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00008.flac	uh of the problems in our world and i think we can see the correlation pretty
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00009.flac	most prominent we surfaces and bares its teeth that's always gonna be tied into message and if we don't address misogyny and
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00010.flac	it all intersect always she's intersect with the impression of women female
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00001.flac	because i had a speech impediment and that almost threw me off
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00002.flac	i remained at least part emerged in that world
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00003.flac	um even in my most rebellious ata lesson times i would still
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00004.flac	you know i mean i was i wanted when i heard about this movie existence i just wanted to be in it whatever way i could i never dream there was gonna be a role that would be my agent would be so
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00005.flac	so then when i had had done an initial audition and went and talked to the venerable conspiracy of david's uh that is haman and
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00006.flac	saturn because it was just so intriguing and exciting and sounded like this really beautiful metaphor for something that i knew in a certain way
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00007.flac	but when it comes time to work there is a focus and an intensity there's just a raw power honestly that
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00008.flac	that he has and he channels um that s when yeah when the scene would start and he would become grave it was such a complete transformation energetically you could feel
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00010.flac	you know for a just very friendly bond with him
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00011.flac	you know credence is drawn to graves and doesn't really see the he feels the sinister but doesn't really connect with it or identify
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00012.flac	contests you know that are some of my uh come from some of my favorite works and some of my
id10309_nMZkxUQ1RqI_00001.flac	evil and bar is just getting into it and it seems exciting and very
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00001.flac	i remember when i told my dad i was eight and i was like dad i'm going to be a performer
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00002.flac	and him being initially kind of taken aback but then having a real really quick coming to the conclusion allowed that like that is
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00003.flac	and i remember when my dad said that to me like feeling like sort of like
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00004.flac	yeah i was right there though i was on the cup in ninety one i was
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00005.flac	i think that makes us less whole us as people
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00006.flac	recycling these these we keep drawing these battle lines
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00007.flac	human beings are amazing and i love is and is an honor and and and an opportunity
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00008.flac	different songs but i would when i was a kid i would only let him sing one song and it was a song he used to fall asleep to
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00001.flac	very interesting again very challenging but very intriguing
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00002.flac	so amazing really to play a character who's you know i've played dark sad upset disturbed uh characters of other varieties before
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00003.flac	but this was six months of shooting you know which is very different
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00004.flac	in terms of the the execution of it for more than a couple months in terms of
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00005.flac	returning to cretins body uh brought up challenges for me that i didn't expect um in terms of
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00006.flac	working on this film and she was very generous with me she became in many ways uh my uh
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00007.flac	fairy godmother in england even as she was playing my bad foster mother in new york um
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00008.flac	yeah and just an unbelievable opportunity to work
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00009.flac	um and incredible channel into many art forms i mean i think what's amazing about sam is that she's every medium she's music and she's
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00010.flac	you know creates film and she's constantly writing and she's uh constantly creating and when she she and so when she comes to uh a project
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00011.flac	like she just brings all of these all these incredible resources and she had some experiences in her life that were almost parallel to pretences experience and so she was very excited to play this role because she was almost able to
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00012.flac	and i feel only comfortable saying something like that just because she's she's spoken of it
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00013.flac	and so she is that she had this deep understanding of these dynamics that she was actually able to share with me and she was actually very helpful for me in in the formation of myth
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00014.flac	it's so cool i mean it's so cool honestly this year has been so
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00015.flac	but inevitably fall into um it's been a fantastic year uh but going from fantastic beasts
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00016.flac	at this very different space i mean in every way the tone
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00017.flac	the character the physicality it's almost
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00001.flac	it's more than you ever really even allow yourself to dream
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00002.flac	good to be true i can't really describe the feeling it's it's like butterflies but there
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00003.flac	uh daily confront the reality of abuse
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00004.flac	and then to victimize that other uh instead of dealing with ourselves
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00005.flac	it's easy to sort of not pay attention to the fact that that's happening in so many of the homes across
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00006.flac	but it's real and it's something that that we have to deal with so yeah a lot of my my
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00007.flac	called childline in the uk who are their responses and outreach program for
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00008.flac	heart their organizations like that that exist all around the world where you can find um support networks uh for people who are survivors of abuse um and i'm really grateful to childline let me sort of talk to some of their responders and then also
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00009.flac	some survivors also talking to some people in my life who are survivors in a similar way like a really similar way to credence that specific in foster care you know the drama of
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00010.flac	of losing or never having your your biological family hum but then the process of going from family to family and sometimes these people come out faster with the wrong intentions and so all of that was the hardest part dealing with that confronting that because i just found that
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00011.flac	problem in our world and it's on microcosms in homes and then it's the macrocosm
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00012.flac	uh that we create just parent to child parent to child care
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00001.flac	yeah probably definitely i was i was gonna
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00002.flac	yeah i mean and that's that's true i mean it shouldn't be this was this art form actor if you think about what it is in a basic form it shouldn't be a a beauty
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00003.flac	yeah great yeah great that's that's what i'd need if i was getting a shot at a remote country and yes passion
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00004.flac	i was like who in their right mind would take steven
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00005.flac	uh when i was born i can't really remember is one
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00006.flac	kids kids play and when kids play they make believe and they put themselves into
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00007.flac	time to stop playing make believe and um i was really lucky to find when i was like
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00008.flac	i got to opera and then was able to actually find a really like
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00009.flac	as they sing with them for two years so then it was like i talk about being sanctioned it was like professional
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00010.flac	i don't wanna work just for the sake of working i wanna wait for the project to be right
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00011.flac	something that will uh will challenge me and and and something that that i know i can bring a lot too
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00012.flac	see the final result and it's so you know like moving and all
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00013.flac	and like when you know i feel so proud of this film every time that happens i feel like i become it reinforces my will to be
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00014.flac	uh that whoever had whatever the brain
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00015.flac	then there were there were it was only so far you could go wrong with what we'd done
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00016.flac	i certainly did not expect how far right it had gone
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00017.flac	i mean i was crying when the film ended um and i i
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00018.flac	and there was this young girl who
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00019.flac	this film was made for one kid in a base and we're trying desperately to
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00001.flac	love to be able to do like the in gorgie and reducto
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00002.flac	just to make things different sizes so i'd like to right now be able to make you very
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00003.flac	i would have just clung to ron perlman's head uh and played an er uh if that's what i had to do to be involved in fantastic bend or to find them
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00004.flac	the fact that the character was a dream role for any actor i was just a very very luscious icing on an already
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00005.flac	was really fantastic when you see nineteen twenties underwear
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00006.flac	you understand that they had they knew things
id10309_uTOEzdTJNmU_00001.flac	i don't identify with that i think that makes us less whole
id10309_uTOEzdTJNmU_00002.flac	human beings are amazing and love is and is an honor and a and an opportunity and and a fragile thing
id10309_uTOEzdTJNmU_00003.flac	i mean i i i i guess i mean um someone else
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00001.flac	you know drink from that well um and draw information and get
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00002.flac	but i would certainly pre order them online at the first available opportunity uh and would wait for them eagerly like go and check the mailbox long before it was possible that they would be there that sort of thing or the kid with
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00003.flac	yeah and yeah i would would listen to the audience boos almost every day of my life for several years embarrassingly
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00004.flac	in in one way or another especially when we are children we have such an access point to magic through our
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00005.flac	i brought back to the true magic that we all partake of uh reminded again
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00006.flac	and again and again that it's that it's friendship you know and that
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00007.flac	cal imagination of what magic could be but then ultimately we're always brought back to the true magic
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00008.flac	i think that is a truth that can be found through a lot of the wisdom traditions of the world those uh people who do practice magic um i think would agree with jake
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00009.flac	there 's something at the root which has to do with how human beings have this dangerous tendency to separate ourselves from the world and the beings around us
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00010.flac	with separation um we lose awareness and with a loss of awareness we become frightened because and and when we're frightened we often uh lash out or demand eyes or target what we're frightened of and
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00011.flac	you know permeating all culture is this dangerous element of seeing someone else as completely separate from yourself losing awareness of how those people are different but at the root always the same and then demonizing and targeting other people
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00012.flac	the dangers in the world that jake rolling seems to time and time again direct our attention to and what a great time for this film to come out as
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00013.flac	the situation is unbelievably drum we've we've lost half there
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00014.flac	no matter what no matter how quickly we can pull it together
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00015.flac	our you know ship on this destructive path we're
