id10059_229vKIGbxrI_00005.flac	i don't wanna pin point what exactly god is i i didn't see the burning
id10059_229vKIGbxrI_00006.flac	everywhere including the philosophy i think god's everywhere from the
id10059_229vKIGbxrI_00007.flac	um in portraying character you poject a lot of what you wanna do dramatically so i did a lot with that with the tiger but also when you portray something you're imitating it you're interpretid it so i

id10059_229vKIGbxrI_00015.flac	iven cursed like wha why why this movie chose me to to to be the veecal what have i done why do i have to go
id10059_229vKIGbxrI_00016.flac	it's very hard to judge success i i don't wanna mesure success  box office or  riny or even ward her mouth
id10059_229vKIGbxrI_00017.flac	how i connect and my crew connect with the experience of making it is something else to me every every movie wen go through that

id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00003.flac	between me and sight and sound and i had some theatrical background that helped the dramatic event
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00004.flac	just when when i everybody started to listen to me
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00005.flac	it's a script competition helped by the government i thought i might win some
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00006.flac	i pitched them te movie they pitched them to me they say wet a king of
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00007.flac	we're gonna make this movie the whole time i was hoping that
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00008.flac	u i told him i spent an hour told him i the movie is like the
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00009.flac	if you want me to make another movie which i didn't want to  end my career i i feel like retiring after
id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00010.flac	sas a bad my my oder son with make me that trip he saids bad example

id10059_2iL0P9T7pYY_00013.flac	y i had some difficultie some feel hesitater o didn't call back
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00001.flac	uh for obvious reasons but i like that kind of work i need to work instead of uh sitting at home feel bad for myself i need something i need a direction
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00002.flac	less of a productionstress of make you focus on preserving the performance only
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00003.flac	whatever ambition since you have since the student days all you have to do is finish the day and make sure that
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00004.flac	yeah it feels that way it feels like that project that story wants to meet the
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00005.flac	making the movie is about trusting the tal trusting each other that's
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00006.flac	then the second time met her she took me around in northern part of wyoming showed me the towns the foks
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00007.flac	thin broke back mountain would be uh something with larri mak martrs even more
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00008.flac	but once i was on board once she said what she had to say the wyoming way whenever talk about being gayng wyomin but just wyoming
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00009.flac	and thevive the the feeling of wioming the the west not the your western movie west but realistic uh rual life of a american west and the spirit of
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00010.flac	the foundation she was to make sure i's captured uh on
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00011.flac	bother us on the script or anything i'm sure she struggle with the script writer early ong i mats many years before i was on board but once i start making the movie and it was my movies she would give us notes about don't forget this and that many details like the's just
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00012.flac	not not really uh i i did wride with the devl another movie which is  ree western
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00013.flac	it's hard to get the the right the proper finance money to
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00014.flac	the met and and hearting sheep in the mountain brokeback mountin wyoming tough
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00015.flac	one na that gets twoo colder both in the ten tipped over they didn't know what happened they thought it's one summer
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00016.flac	uh become function tho father and husband leave their
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00017.flac	a  kept trying to to hide out going back to brokback mountain because having a life together it's not possible
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00018.flac	i was surprised seene by seeing how they carried the age you know twenty to
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00019.flac	put puttig regular preparation i want him to carry that western mood
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00020.flac	sort of the other side of american werer more familiar with the romantic the
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00021.flac	there struck me as he's a uh actor with weigt he really hold your
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00022.flac	all i could do for the movie cause i shot et that way the flashback happend twice
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00023.flac	then you go for precisions cause there's no coverage in this sine i wanna do  one
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00024.flac	yeah they just set los and sometimes something magic happen it's not one person's plan they have to corespond to each other
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00025.flac	who knows which one is is the most perfect one i also you have to see how it fit with everything else in the movie so i was guessing it was kept doing at kept
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00026.flac	tme and because the challenge i think the only way they get out of it is they have to be
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00027.flac	i think it's i was very movied on i i was hardly movie i was professional  i remember u
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00028.flac	they're kind of besides themselves very genuine and i w i was
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00029.flac	they feel like a cowboy they feel like ranchhan tthey know each other so much more
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00030.flac	somesomebody asked me uhm how do you feel after thats shooting that
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00031.flac	and on the set i feel right up we're doing the scene it feels quite
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00032.flac	ii craft the movie and lay it out reveal the story in the way i think nobody knows anything
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00033.flac	tha know so much and have anticipations and how do you take that into caculation how do you take that
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00034.flac	things are not always in control like you have a thousand sheep
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00035.flac	and shooting is like byan groceries i try to get the best in gredien
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00036.flac	very exciting about shooting is you prepare for months from your decision to make it to all the way to the day you're shooting that scene it's a long process a lot of anticipation so many people's effort now everything's
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00037.flac	and they're not in control you're battling it that moment's very precious especially
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00038.flac	that moment is very precious to me i was in  aultered state which i am not in when i'm just laed back in edits
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00039.flac	like in te hoe i can shoot everything this i have to decide but still that's my decision
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00040.flac	and help shaping it by observing it and finding it it's n
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00041.flac	unless povuh politically really provocative i could get the movie i'm well
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00042.flac	uh to do up to my standord in terms o productions that's a
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00043.flac	you have to make things happen instead of two hundred people push you forward ou push two hundred people  something like that but it gets easier the more movie
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00044.flac	i think the biggest battle is is is culture how do you make it how do you when a movie come out how do
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00045.flac	but other than that it is  i real like yeah i feel like a little wie i
id10059_qM5FO3hHEbk_00046.flac	the less known material like brokeback mountain attracts me but that's also
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00001.flac	you don't think about diversion at all just because we're playing such different characters it's not we're not in a distopian world or you know everything is different about these guys so
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00002.flac	coping magitmek meconisms i think that you know one could say that agustis is fearless but
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00003.flac	and hehe is actually very very fearful of of dying without leaving his mark and hazel helps him
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00004.flac	it's a  like an idealistic way of thinking about things right everyone everyone wants to be not everyone but especially t a young age like you're told that like success is what you want and it you wanna change the world and then as you get
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00005.flac	realizing you know even even if you do like leave a mark what does that what's the big deal like as hasl says oblivin's inevitable
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00006.flac	um thtand uyeah that's it's an i think it's a natural thing for young people to have so it's realistic that john writes a
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00007.flac	any of my heros that you know were were bad people or something i once heard a funny story someone someone said that theye were like a
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00008.flac	like a long time go obviously a big fan of micky mantale a huge fan and they waited and they waited outside of yanky stadium for him to show up and when he finally did they ran over to him and mickey micka a havea
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00009.flac	but they you know they're not obsessed with van han they're just hazels obsessed with this book
id10062_11wavAHn4cs_00010.flac	they're more tyou know they don't idlize inatan in that way so when he does sort o spit on them they're sort of like screw you man we don't need you anymore what we have here is more
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00001.flac	tw crept about two years ago and i mean it was pretty much simultaneous that the the whole movie hype and the book rose together so it was um perfect timing like i i i actually read
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00002.flac	um which was when i was really getting popular and shortly it it became my favorite book and i really really loved it and once i read i hadn't gotten the role yet and i ws like i need to get
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00003.flac	i feel like everyone's dealt with cancer indirectly directly um someone they know or they know someone who knows someone um so that makes a story obviously very universal um but then also it's it's a above that it's a beautiful love story and ii think that's what makes our movie so special is that you leave the theater
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00004.flac	hopeful and um someone once told me that that once they left the theater tha they called everyone they loved and told them that they love
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00005.flac	s uh it really is about appreciating what's in front of you and it's not just a sad story and i think that's
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00006.flac	i thik that's always very interesting because especially as actors and when we're young and in school all they tell us to do is be natural and be as you know just be as natural as possible but sometimes people in real life have a have a
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00007.flac	and i think agustus in the begining of the story definitely has a blugf and he's over the top and he
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00008.flac	that was i think that wasnt important to us because it's not often that a studio movie would have their leading lady having a cannul in their mouth always or on the movie poster let alone and that that's something that hollywood doesn't do very often and we were really proud to to do something like that and really
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00009.flac	you know have the the the real the main characters be the people with the disease and and show it and like not
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00010.flac	razy feeling but you know i i mean i'm not gonna take credit for anything tom cruse is tom cruise and he's amazing uh it's just our story i think is a really special story and i couldn't be happier that you know that we
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00011.flac	when someone said you know you can always make art and make the best art you can but you can never guarrantee you'll have an audience for it and something that we're all proud of me my costars shalene and nat um we're so proud because this is something we're all so happy with and proud of and this is the thing that we're getting the most audience for and getting recognized for and that
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00012.flac	whe 'are forced to take weird jobs or job you know because we'll take anything however
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00013.flac	right now i'm working on a lot of i always work on an solo which is my music project i make the house house music and electric dance music um i did a movie with jason ritman who was the director of juno and up in the air and that i'll come out next year and that's with adam sandler and emma tompson
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00014.flac	you just have to busy yourself with what you love and that's like i said that's one reason why i do make music and i go rock climing with my friends still and i just do my i go through my normal life um i've really try not to let you know i i haven't changed my life style since allthe
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00015.flac	um you know i i try to live a normal a normal lifestyle  think i think like you know people get in trouble when they just start only
id10062_EJCAgjbGKJQ_00016.flac	and thinking that now that they're the top of the world they can do anything and but i i i wanna
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00001.flac	in this world of divergient when you're sixteen uh you have the option to leave your family and
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00002.flac	me and my sister leave our family behind and joine different factions based off of who we think we are uh i join the inteligent faction and she joines the brave faction um
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00003.flac	has a little problem with the faction my parents are from so that creates a lot of conflict in
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00004.flac	i think as an actor you have to relate to you have to find some way of relating to them otherwize it's not gonna be real
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00005.flac	right you know i'm not gonna like play him as if he's like being evil or something he's he's being good or he thinks he's being
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00006.flac	he thinks ardiht is the place that has a a great plan for humanity and peace and um that's why he joins that faction so i had to just bring that out of myself at the
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00007.flac	you know he thinks  beatris is coming in there saying o andshe starts she comes to eradigt
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00008.flac	in the in the story so it's not thathe's being mean is just that he's defending his new
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00009.flac	you know it's just like i loved working with her in di vergent um she is
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00010.flac	itsthe entire movie i think without shaleng this wouldn't work you know any movie where you have someone like that and you have
id10062_Ka5FS6LFCzE_00011.flac	uh she's so spectacular so i mean i'm just privileged and lucky enough to be able to have had another projuct with her that
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00001.flac	kid charlie that that comes to uh gets kicked out of prie school and comes to a public high school it the intention of
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00002.flac	uh he he sort of breaks down the the stario types of this school and and
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00003.flac	yeah i think it's tough but it's all there its really it's iyou if you watch the movie it's all
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00004.flac	all in all gardner and charlie are very similar and i think that's what unifyes them and that's what makes their sort of their their chest match all the more powerful is that each
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00005.flac	needs to learn that he can't always be a parent to himself and he can't always be an dultand that he has to be a  kid
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00006.flac	to his and sort of clarify what he actually wants from his life you know
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00007.flac	i think by facing char charlie's the one that puts him face to face with all the the pressures in his life that that are making it unhappy
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00008.flac	n and and it's almost like i i i think the relationship between gardener and charlie is it's it's like a seesaw it's like with parents
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00009.flac	uh you know parents in kids in general someone goes down someone goes up smeone pushes down and someone comes up and in order to get the sesal working you  both have to be
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00010.flac	o that was a stunt double who was really awsome yeah who was really really they were they're
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00011.flac	it was hard work and what i have to say it was it was it was hard work but it was enjoyable
id10066_1m1C-CdhmZ0_00012.flac	they're gonna enjoy this film i really think i eally think it's it's it's hodest
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00001.flac	um before that because i wasn't allowed to read the script till a month before we started shooting and so i um
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00002.flac	you know on the enterprise and that was as far as it went you know and we talked we talked about billy wilder we had this very nice meeting and then that was it and  i didn't hear anything for a couple months and then
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00003.flac	i i was told to come in andd read and also i couldn't read the sides like usually i get the sides of my house
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00004.flac	but here i just had to come in and read them and go in and audition with them so i got these sides and i got some sides from the old um from from some of the old track
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00005.flac	i went in and i read them and that was that like i didn't really know anything about checkof either at that
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00006.flac	and that was honestly how it stayed up until i got the script and i watched the old shows and i got really into the character and i would talk to jj and ask him sort of um what he wanted to keep and what he wanted to uh get rid of
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00007.flac	for and you have to do your own thing and remain respectful at the same time di think that's the goal of the film is to be its own treck film not just a repeat of what you've already
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00008.flac	but remain respectful to the old show and remain entertaining to people tha ave been fansof for this
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00009.flac	it it's it's a interesting line to follow because you pick and choose and you see what you can bring that's your own and then i i met with walter knnig and we had thi they had this talk and that's really what he said to me and and he said you know it looks like you guys are being really smart about this and doing your own thing and and yet you know i see traces of myself in what you're doing and it was really
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00010.flac	it was really great for me to hear that because i was so nervous a
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00011.flac	you know he he told me about his accent and how he wo'ld get worried about that and
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00012.flac	he told me that he felt i had some of the cadences sort of more on the right track and then you know and it was really it was
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00013.flac	really pick and choose what i thought was necessary and for me i think the most important thing was to capture that spirit of chekov you know because he was always this sort of weird comedic relief
id10066_3LsFdM9Xipg_00014.flac	and and and really funny and and strange i mean theire episodes were checkov literally is doing no work and macking on his girlfriend the
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00001.flac	what you see about him initially pretty much till about half the film is his unyelding
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00002.flac	the end through their personalities in how similar they are they help each other they sort of
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00003.flac	just speaks to him and murphy naturally gets offended because he's always on the offensive and so he dunks his head in the toilet and the first time charlie sees
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00004.flac	i'm always like for making it as real but a sort of weird as possible you know because everything that charlie does has this
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00005.flac	he takes things that adult sa and sort of translates them into
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00006.flac	like their kids wanna be hearing takes what the kids are saying and translated to what the adults wanna be hearing and that's both
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00007.flac	one of these guys like his his names arnold he's he's one of the like one ofthe the guys ha
id10066_84u6vRdws38_00008.flac	and him and his friends all sort of did this thing for me and we did like take after take where i learned from these

id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00002.flac	t experience of the outside world pretty much everything he knows is what happens on on mars

id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00006.flac	which uh gardner really doesn't lat the start of the film because no one knows he exists and uh in his words how can he be indispensible if no one
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00007.flac	motive about finding somewhere to that he belongs and that he's feels safe is also something i think everyone needs and everyone a
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00008.flac	i mean this this whole uh story is so revolves around gardeners and tods
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00009.flac	uhyeah meand br had a lot of fun and uh it's quite uh the way their relationship
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00010.flac	s through the film it's quite interesting because they both kind of ballance each other out
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00011.flac	manic kind of almost energy and gardne s much camer and kind of um
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00012.flac	e's been amazing fun to work with he's ah he's a really nice guy and he's a the nomenal actor as well
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00013.flac	an important part of his life and been such an important kind of aspect of who he is um so because of that we really wanted to make sure the relationship was quite sort of fun um although
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00014.flac	she is almost his caretaker an a kind of mothery aspect she's all they're l almost like siblings so they have that kind of banter and that um lightheartedness which is chwe both really wanted to capture and make sure it wasn't too um
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00015.flac	and ho appreciates a good coup of tee so um yeah he's
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00016.flac	gardener and um he used to be an actor as well so he really understands acting and he really understands  sort of e way an actor works
id10071_A2bWI0qrkd8_00017.flac	uh when you have that and you have that kind of appreciation from the director and he knows what he's doing then you can trust him a lotmore and everything just
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00001.flac	was the first toine i watched of his i think and it was first one well onny kind af scared me as a kid i was quite young when i watched it but i just loved how wacky it was and tim wasn't like afraid to just do what he wanted and make the film he wanted to make and as i got older that was like i really respected that about him as a director he didn't kind of
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00002.flac	hare as ideas he never really ot of gave me advice and acting because it's a very kind of there'
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00003.flac	a lot of respect given between  directors and actors and you gotta have that trust so he trusts my instincts and i trust
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00004.flac	is invaluable really as a source material having all of the information is great
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00005.flac	in florida and by the end of the film he's he's this hero almost even though he's kinda unconventional and he didn't really mean to be there he still takes uppon that role and i think that's admirable and for me tuning into that uh that transition and that decision um even though he's in some where where he feels out of place and he
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00006.flac	lucky enough to be able to i've been doing big budget movies but i can also do a lot of independent films which uhi enjoyed just as much really i just came off a shoot which was a really small budget it was a four week shoot in uh minnasota i was playing this punk base guitar player and that was so much fun i mean it was hard work cause we were working all day pretty much every day
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00007.flac	you the american accent which is uh which is a whole other thing but thankfully
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00008.flac	except i was surounded by british castang crew which made it quite difficult
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00009.flac	you n i mean kinda out of this world an went outevery time i came back to the industry and i came back to doing a film i'd grown up a little bit more and i think that was
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00010.flac	um i haven't um not for a while i mean i i don't like watching myself
id10071_Yx25TirmNH0_00011.flac	ut i did u a couple years ago i re watched the boy in the strigke pajamas which was the first time i'd seen it in a
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00001.flac	acturally as you can imagine u but tot tim  even though
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00002.flac	in this incredible director whe's had such an iconic kinda history he's incredibly down to earthand he's incredibly humble and he's um
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00003.flac	process i'd read it just after the script and then i read the next ones as soon as they came out u great books great books i
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00004.flac	it is o the audience in this story he's thehe he's the normal one u hes
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00005.flac	was kinda a story is actually real and so he feels out of place he feels totally uncomfortable and that's
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00006.flac	relate to one way o anothr vryone's been in that position maybe not this
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00007.flac	ut uh there was there's great parts of everything having the props here and the sets which are so rich and
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00008.flac	is incredibly helpful for an actor because you're just kinda in there and you're in the moment and there's no kind of distractions and you feel like you're in this fairy tale environment literally
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00009.flac	you imagine this monster is chasing you up the stairs and for me i actually really enjoy that
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00010.flac	playing and hletting your imagination go wild it's like you know whenyou're a kid and you you're running up the stairs and yoyou trick yourself that there's something chasing you and you scare yourself that's literally what you're doing and
id10071_pfbGbGisZD0_00011.flac	you have a lot of fun with that when elsedod you get to do that everyone's so sof sensible and serious in real life
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00001.flac	making it as sort of songwriters of one off hits they were um they were writing songs for disney shows in at phincelo and until finally they were just brought underas the first contract songwriters and one of them uh

id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00005.flac	and we got the idea to make our own tour and uwe borrowed one of the tapes from the
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00006.flac	mischivous and we went uh back to my my house and we transscribed every
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00007.flac	erething was and then we wrote our own tor and we got a kid in our school with a very deep voice a kid from
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00008.flac	and you know made new labels and we actually made a batch of fifteen of these
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00009.flac	we got a bunch of friends to walk through the museum taking the tour and as they took it they sorto
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00010.flac	i told them thinking they'd love it they said you can't do this to the museum i did it anyway and the next day uh at the kitchen table there was a coppy of the boston globe which had an article called wild ride through
id10077_1-fy8YgOTw4_00011.flac	thin about a a prank to um to like the pecoso exibit or something cause i wanted to like hide that i knew what was up aand they're like ohno no it was the chinese art exhibit wild ride through dragons that's what
id10077_Awi1Q0yib1s_00001.flac	uh thing that could ever happen to astand up comic i got heckled with constructive
id10077_Awi1Q0yib1s_00002.flac	uh when you see a celebrity outo biography on the shelfes and it says with william kno back at the bottom that's

id10077_Awi1Q0yib1s_00008.flac	i thought well this has to be a michael jackson inpersonater because this isn't what michael jackson wouldever wear on his date

id10083_f6jUTQOPnNw_00003.flac	bang i would imagine we did drew ut our quarterback i played i played primarily defense uh and then we went to rival high schools i went to astin high and we went to westlakehgh and they proceeded to uh beat the pants off of us
id10083_f6jUTQOPnNw_00004.flac	he was although when he went to westtlake if i remember corectly i think he had to to work his way back up cause they of course they did not
id10083_f6jUTQOPnNw_00005.flac	texs football you know that if you're in a certain district th the really good competitive schools will groom the players from elementary school middl school whenever they start playing in the same offensive formation same offensive system all the way through so that by the time they're playing in high school even
id10083_f6jUTQOPnNw_00006.flac	modest and it's uh aspirations i kess you might say um i we go

id10083_fmUU_q0LYY4_00014.flac	you're not afraid tof you know pick here and there when when when we're maye we're not doing things exactly
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00001.flac	coming to work uh with with uh with bob i feel comfortable calling him bob finally after
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00002.flac	you know basically the idea of the father in law son in law
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00003.flac	you know how how you deal with that that guy who's sort of you know giving over his daughter to you
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00004.flac	at you know in  you know around the world the people can identify with you wanna impress that person you wanna
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00005.flac	so that that i think that combined with just the chemistry between everybody it's just been it feels like it's uh you know had a a very legitimate
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00006.flac	i just always uh h creatively i always just get get excited working
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00007.flac	the you know kind of uh self pittying sort of thing these little ways that kevin has of manipulating people that greg seems to be the only one to catch on to uh and the way that he's just such a a rock star in jack's eyes and can not do any wrong
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00008.flac	inar it's barbera stri sand you know she's just basically someone who's so hewhat she's
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00009.flac	you know who she is in our culture o you know her talent as a singer actress
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00010.flac	you know it's kind of hard to get past that when you're with her and she just i think she is very comfortable with who she is and she brings that ara about her when she comes on the set so uh
id10084_2eaxqJbzfUc_00011.flac	ih i've always am excited to to work with her to be able to call her
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00001.flac	think uh they have their own tone and uh i guess so i don't know i mean i think it's a uniqke thing um and i never know why a movie is successful or not tell you the truth
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00002.flac	ayes of course i mean every tie you make a movie you wantad to connect with people but somehow these have connected with people i you know i i remember readng th
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00003.flac	heuh the making of it did it it created this um sort of uh yeah combination of thing
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00004.flac	yeah i mean i  they're probably a little old fashioned that way but um you know i think it's that balance whe're also now the third movie in it's been about eight or nine years since the first movie and these characters have grown and the audience has gotten to know them so there's a you know there's a real history with
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00005.flac	you know i've never felt that people try to out gag each other on a movie i mean i think people try
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00006.flac	you know you wanna just do your best you wanna you know sort of be you know cause it's someone that you are a fan of you wanna just kind of you know i mean you know like with with robin williamsik anytime i was ever working with robin i you know i'm such a fan that like i would wanna try to be good
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00007.flac	um and it's the same thing with anyone you know uh with uh you know with ricky he's just very very funny and and he's a great improviser and and so you know it's fun to go back and forth but it's uh i think it just keeps you sort of
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00008.flac	well he's he made so many great movies and and so many incredible performances and lie performances and you know what he did on comic relief and just you know there he just left an incredible amount of work uh behind and um so
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00009.flac	and it actually iis really cool and  you know we make these movies on the on a set and we shoot them you know for for months during the day and but you know when you actually get to go on location and be in a museum at night you go oh okay i get it this is actually
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00010.flac	and and very cool so it was funa y actually actually got to go there um last night because we had the premier and had he party there and it was the same thing it was like oyou wanna just go around the corner and just see
id10084_Wmwlyb2ob9Q_00011.flac	iused toi was given the tablet by shan so now i've got it at home and wi'll see what it brings to
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00001.flac	as i i i was saying it was um we actually wrote the script about five years ago the first draft of it and justin was always in it but he was just sort of a you know sort of this teen pop star and now he has this whole other cultural significance and
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00002.flac	he was just a head of the curve somehow um you know it it's just yeah it's ait's really interesting to look at it that way when we started thinking about doing the movie thinking about the first one and how much has changed in terms of um social media which just didn't really exist back then and how it's changed our attitudes about ourselves and youknow i see it kids and my kids and just you know it's part of their life so you know it's uh definitely right up derek's
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00003.flac	uh it's been fun to sort of you know have him explore that world
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00004.flac	and then the line we cut out was and you don't know how youh saying that about me makes me feel about
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00005.flac	yeah i mean yeah i it's you know itit's the it's all it's a part of being human for sure and how much we indulge it and how much you wanna flipp your camera phone to you know to selfi
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00006.flac	later doing another one it it' just for me that's i think maybe that's part of what has changed in in how people experienced movies is that it was discovered ither you know at first throughdvdand
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00007.flac	don't know i honestly don't know i mean i think part of it might be that you know what we were talking about earlier that you know derek does sort of
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00008.flac	exists in this selfe culture and and you know the narcicism and also the innocence of the character he's a sweet guy has a sweet innocent guy who really is incredibly self absorbed but
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00009.flac	referencing blu steele and and you know cause it's a look also that everybody does when somebody takes a picture
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00010.flac	have i think when you're doing comedy and any type you just have to go
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00011.flac	i  now i just wi'd like to make a mvie a movie that's that's just sort of you knw maye me like a historical thing or something that's like kind of not necessarily uh haveing to be
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00012.flac	um but uh you know he's i now for me he seems more like sort of like like
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00013.flac	some people are taking him seriously which is the crazy thing um and i think you know he is um you knowi think he's
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00014.flac	going with it as long as people keep taking it but i don't see it going uh
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00015.flac	how gracious he was uh first of all he had no business being in our movie cause we we i didn't know him right we just reached out  we said hey you know be so cool if david boie would be the uh walk off judge and and
id10084_aVq8Pw_D-88_00016.flac	he helped us by you know he legitimized us by being in the film
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00001.flac	it's uh it's allarming and i'm always trying to talk directors into letting me at least wear a jacket i went on stage in new york not only not wearing a jacket but also
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00002.flac	took my socks away i mean the length of the we talked more about my whether i should wear socks or not then about
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00003.flac	largely when i'm on stage i like you know if you really want the best out of me put me in a lounge sut what we used to calle i love the
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00004.flac	chit means thatyou know uh do you have lounges in i in you know it means like a front room i think well i dn't
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00005.flac	iwell you wanna hear about it i's a two piece sut it has a a single vent in the jacket it has a single pleat on the trouser it has a turnup of standar uh depth on each trouser leg it has two backpockets it has ajusters on the waist nothing has
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00006.flac	e because i do i just get sad am and there's a i think it's because you're chedl to feel
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00007.flac	and that t was the pressure is too much you know and it's a bu not ony to be happy but  at a very
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00008.flac	and people whe always seemed i my my memories of new years is always people saying cheer it may never happen you know stuff like that which is enough to make you homisidele but i can't really remember any good ones really i've had some nice lovely ones with my family where you where it's nice and easy and you just say
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00009.flac	english uh filmmaking um what else would i like to say i'd love to see misissippy burning again for the first time it's one of my favorite films and i it's one of those films where you if you're flipping on tv you just stay there it's like it's like the godfather you just wa
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00010.flac	u no mean it's like punch drunk love i know it by heart you just stay there cause there's there's nothing gonna be on that's gonna be better than that and miss
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00011.flac	i don't think they were ever gonna be the agents of social change i didn't ever think rock and rolle was gonna change the world i just thought it you could dance
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00012.flac	uh and i liked it for itself cause i just dig the sound um but uh yeah i mean you know i mean
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00013.flac	if they knock on the door and ask to take your daughter anywhere then i think you you have every right to worry but apart from that i think youd have
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00014.flac	when the sex pistels came out and i was old enough then you know to view it with a weather eye and you saw the the whole of english society went mental because these four kids you know malcoma
id10089_8rzQXxPi2-g_00015.flac	and got up and said thank god the oh god bless the queen she's a faciest regieme uh the great thing about england is that or inor in america you can say that it's
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00001.flac	dn't i try and avoid them i used to read reviews but uh it's dangerous reading reviews and i i'm a
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00002.flac	your side and you read them you become too wonderful for your own good i
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00003.flac	it's quite it's lately it's been complicated we've been pretty lucky but yeah it's a funny old job and it's a strang
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00004.flac	family and things it's difficult to organize sometimes you know but it we we rub along you know it we do pretty well and she's quite remarkable in ha way that she
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00005.flac	so i was pleased in that respect it's a very wonderful part for me and uh i play with stella gonna who your viewers might be familiar with from the house of eliet she play beatris in the house of elit she's a wonderful actress and the bulk of the of the evening is she and i together and it's um and i'm extremely grateful that i've got somebody like stella to work with because uhit helps an enormous aunt
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00006.flac	a sexsimble before the men's room i used to have no trouble at all going up the shops or walking down th
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00007.flac	i got to work with some terrific people everyone on it ut it was it wasn't just about the fact that i got to drop
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00008.flac	i mean i suppose in your i suppose you everybody dreams of being famous in fact i know a few uh properly famous people and it's not much fun unless you're
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00009.flac	way i'm just nicely recognizable in the town in which i live which is
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00010.flac	those circumstances i think it's you you should be grateful it's a veary tough business and you should be grateful tod be remembered for anything as long as it's something favorable you know and the men's room was a was a very rerespectable stab at trying to examin people's lives and how they carry on and men and women and with the emphasis on how relations between men and women and it was an honest
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00011.flac	to look at those things and people responded to it and it hit a particular spot um and also i think that the way in which we did all the bedroom stuff it wasn't simply uh it wasn't that stuffwhere there's a marvelous soundtrack everybody does the right thing it
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00012.flac	the do in every area and it was um and that we all get led up the garden path by it and that we
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00013.flac	absolutely yeah it's called now it's called fairytale a true story it stars harvy k harvy kytel and peter otul and uh
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00014.flac	nicked hef dad's camera took it down the bottom of the garden and apparently took
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00015.flac	he had them published in a big magazine at the time called the strand magazine and they became a huge sensation uh and it all blew up in the girl's faces
id10089_o5z9IeCtDzo_00016.flac	they were taken very seriously these pictures and as as you say they didn't come clean about them and they didn't want to disappoint my character edward gardiner they didn't
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00001.flac	i knew nothing about the story and i've never met anyone else who knew anything about the story
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00002.flac	uh and it's amazing given that it's such a great story that
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00003.flac	incredible my reaction to the script was uh i thought it was one of the best scripts i'd ever read
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00004.flac	really that someone has been able to and has taken the time to make something
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00005.flac	and is about something important a couple of things important things
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00006.flac	the the great developments in my lifetime that make you obscurely proud to have been around ar the amancipation of gay men and women ind the civil rights movement in america those are the things that
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00007.flac	if you were asked at gunpoint you know what do you think about your generation and other gener what do you think the great achievement was well those uh two things you would probably reach for first and then the miner strike which was
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00008.flac	not really giving up hope but you kow wo i mean there ware so few things that give you that feeling
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00009.flac	gratitude really that someone has been able to and has taken the time to make something
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00010.flac	i in an acurate manner at least you know a part of it and to have those two stories
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00011.flac	uh so you know everything about it was attractive and i just badly wanted
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00012.flac	i thi it's i think it's really really important and i think it's sort of good
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00013.flac	you know the the story travels information travels well and fast in joke form and
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00014.flac	the only reason people don't do it is cause they can't because there are't many people like steven berisford there are very few people that can write proper
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00015.flac	neejork reactions to certain words or bodily funtions real jokes real proper wit there is so few because like in everything else you know like there is
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00016.flac	good painting it's you know and tand uand people who can write really funny things are extremely rer
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00017.flac	and steven can so he does and it's a but it's a great way of delivering the
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00018.flac	they have a great time hearing about it and and they
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00019.flac	i thoghth well i love working with amelda l working with amelda is heavenly it's sort of actually dreamy i've worked with
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00020.flac	and she is a great woman she's a great woman and she's a and i say it quite seriously she's a and she's a wonderful
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00021.flac	you'll find some that can maybe match her but there's there's no need for any more talent
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00022.flac	butalmost with talent and she's also just incredibly
id10089_sdf5l_qGIK8_00023.flac	um easy and dreamy to be around she's just you you you never  she's one of those few people that you
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00001.flac	it when i finished reading it i thought um i was kind of uh
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00002.flac	i didn't think i was gonna do a play at this point of where i was at and i told my agent in you know kind of cliff notes what the play was about you know and this speech is about having a baby and this is uh i have an you know describe an erection
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00003.flac	that i really connected to that experience that icelates and in
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00004.flac	can't describe it so uh that kind of experience i've felt that i have had and i've felt passionately about certain things that no one else
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00005.flac	into a passion of something that you know you are not gonna be dislodged from you know that no one can
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00006.flac	i i enough that would disade you from it and that that's probably closer to what i
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00007.flac	at times sometimes they think it's creepy sometimes they think it's hilarious and like a big fada farce and other times they think it's like  a
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00008.flac	and it's it's just huge and sometimes at the same moment different pocckets of the
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00009.flac	people in sitting in front of the you know they have their own sense of being within this uh congress of people you know and then they have their own recognition that they're reacting differently than somebody else around them and we had the we kinda put this to edward a lot in previews when it was pretty much like a rock and role thing too it
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00010.flac	you try to tell them you try to be honest with them and what dor they do they
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00011.flac	you know it it changes every fifteen minutes that's the thing about the play he's kinda
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00012.flac	broadway experience i did off broadway when i started out you know in new york it was eighteen years ago so for me i'm kind of
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00013.flac	yeah that much i really do ilike it so much iyou know y wife who's seen the play about nine times  just last time the the only tthe first thing she said i's it's a different kinda animal that likes to
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00014.flac	there's a certain cegment that really wants to be vocal about how they feel about the male female
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00015.flac	and they participate with it and tha that always fules me i mean as being the outsider who has most of the dislikable things to
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00016.flac	you know almost like it's happening in my dream i don't really i can't say it feels like it's you know directly link to how i'm saying the words
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00017.flac	usness of their hostility which kinda makes me get
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00018.flac	i didn't think i was gonna do a play at this point of where i was at and i told my agent in you know kind of cliff notes what the play was about you know and this speech is about having a baby
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00019.flac	ou can't describe it so uh that kind of experience i've felt that i have had and i've felt passionately about certain things that no one else
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00020.flac	into a passion of something that you know you are not gonna be dislodged from you know that no one can
id10090_GtAHVLPqHLc_00021.flac	i  enough that would diswade you from it and that that's probably closer to what i had
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00001.flac	well you know fortunately these are people who uh part of their interestin wine is is telling people about wine and telling peoplebout making wines and they
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00002.flac	you think it'd be enough just to grow up the grapes and make a good wine but
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00003.flac	um it's all about telling people what you're doing why you're doing it so that would they were
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00004.flac	to get a lot of information from ie and i wasn't like they were trying to with hold it or any kind of granma's recipe
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00005.flac	h but i have  has had this little thing about labels
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00006.flac	it the curiosity of fashioning something that you've made putting a label on
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00007.flac	operation so every chris many many christmases we've made
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00008.flac	well we've done everything cause we have a ranch n ntanna so uh and thethere's
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00009.flac	and done that but i mean was also have in california we have a lot of i love to uh the  climate in california intoxicated me when i
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00010.flac	and the experience of walking down  street with another actor and he said do you wanna
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00011.flac	oh  love a oran she and walked into someone's yeard full of
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00012.flac	hend just pulled off an orange and gave it to me i said what are you doing this is somebody's house and these are
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00013.flac	no they don't even bother to pick the frut here it's i they wan na drive in their car to rocry stor and buy the fruit and that feels better to them so we get to have
id10090_MWlgNU65ytc_00014.flac	and uh and i though wow this frout is growi an orenge i can eat an orngees
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00001.flac	we uh realized that uh the now ex president tomus what more
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00002.flac	is is true with others who had some kind of telepathic engagement with the aliens there was uh there remained some psychic disturbance ind
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00003.flac	witmore still a hero to the world but he's been somewhat sequestored off by his close
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00004.flac	to uh because he's he's convinced that uh with his visions and
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00005.flac	intuitions that they're coming back and no one
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00006.flac	i think the the when you begin to sense what the sg is and all of the uh components that go into what uh scale uh can be done on a film these days you see how
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00007.flac	certain scenes i'm in but he's come from scenes with other actors and he seems to be able to go
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00008.flac	for a long day of you know eighteen twenty hours of ay
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00009.flac	i remember in january uh uh after we'd made it in january of the year that it got released
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00010.flac	uh seeing some list in a newspaper about the twenty top movies that are gonna be coming this summer you know and they used to have more of the tent pule movies were all packed in
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00011.flac	and then um april came around and so i saw another list and i went heyway  ma this is of these ten we're in the ten now well that's good uh we're coming up and then they started to run
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00012.flac	trailers of uh you know for the movie which was you know july second they came july third they attacked joly fourth the day we fought back white house boom you know
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00013.flac	it then sclated like a rocket and you i realized how this thing has got some
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00014.flac	i really like the fact that it always rested
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00015.flac	roland's conviction and not the way that we do it and how we do it and everything his rolland and dean together you know wanting to um feel like they got the story right
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00016.flac	to a sequel uh just because everybody told him it was a good idea and it had money behind it or something you know it really was for them we did we had such a ride on the first one we we could
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00017.flac	you know rub some dirt into it if we failed with a sequel so i it was really exciting to get cooked up for this year because it meant that rolland and and and
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00018.flac	different times where uh you know i'll walk into a bathroom like a public bathroom ind catl or something and i'll see the speech written ao some quote from it on there and or you know thoms whitmore for president or you know just little grefit here and there o
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00019.flac	roland's energy and his real sense of how the story the dirness of the situation never is far from his mind
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00020.flac	i think you know at deane always talks about the great love that that you incounter in with different characters and their engagement with other
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00021.flac	um other people and it's a really humanistic embrace of uh who we are and our foibles of who we are and the kind of ridiculousness of what we can how we can act in this face of incredible adversity and yet somehow uh the
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00022.flac	is involved uh  you know now the the stakes are higher
id10090_T9j5rVourqA_00023.flac	and um the vision of what's possible what has to be done is
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00001.flac	almost every season of the voice we tryd to uh change it up a little bit as
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00002.flac	eayou know i'm i'm a little bit intimidated i'm afraid i'm just gonna tell you
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00003.flac	it's not like we just randumly have two girls on the show i mean this is aleca kes and mily
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00004.flac	you know it maybe the only prayer that adam and i have uh at a victory this seasonin
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00005.flac	show and we're going up against two rookies basically as coaches you know i mean i that as proven in the in the past to
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00006.flac	outside of season one when the show their first season and so uh we definitely have that little that little
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00007.flac	hope that we can pull out another victory this season but i i do have a feeling that the blinds are gonna be
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00008.flac	standing up there on that blind audition stage and i can see adam levine or blik
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00009.flac	it's gonna be tough i think to get some of these artists away from them because not only are they knew in shiny
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00010.flac	also so incredibly talented and they've kinda blased their own path and that's what you
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00011.flac	country music credibility no question about it not only because of her dad but
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00012.flac	uh but i hope she's i hope she's not over confident
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00013.flac	the thing i think's gonna surprise people out there about maly
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00014.flac	it's one thing for her just to be a good singer and is great performer but she's also has this ear for music and and great ideas and great visions not only for herself for other artists we saw
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00015.flac	what they were doing as their performance she had a million ideas and and
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00016.flac	not only articulate it to him but could sing it to him and that's what blew me away i'm still not good at that
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00017.flac	creative personality uh for the show where i think that the other three coaches me mily and adam were were kinda in your
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00018.flac	it's a little more laid back and she's really focused on her music you know and so uh i think that's gonna be very appealing to a lot of these artists whenever they you know have a chance to to get the opportunity to work with her if she hits her
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00019.flac	those great songs that she's written and that all those great performances that nobody forgets on a ward shows and things i mean she is
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00020.flac	and i thought about this i i gotta say that if i was an artist and got four chairs to turn it would be hard for me not to pick alecia kis as my
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00021.flac	a song by soan so and i ran into this same problem and here's what i did or
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00022.flac	the way i would perform this song would be like this because one time years ago i did whatever he
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00023.flac	you're able to put your own experiences into play to help another artist
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00024.flac	it's new to me every season because it's new people that's that's the thing that i can't
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00025.flac	emphacize enough is this show it does have a format but every
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00026.flac	it's new artists that come and and try out and this shows about the artists that audition
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00027.flac	and so we have a new storyline every season and it's it's so excit
id10095_LawD2f_daPM_00028.flac	perform but about how they sound when they sing and that's that's where it should start in music bottom line that's where it should start if you wanna be
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00001.flac	music uh definitely has a lot of those elements in it like we had with uh the barn and grill album and and my my first two or three albums god i don't even know the names of those albums anymore but
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00002.flac	to this thing and then like two days before it's time they're like oh yeah we need iat allum titl n you're like album title
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00003.flac	no an neon light at the end of the tie i mean if you've had a bad experience which you probably never have
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00004.flac	have had some bad experiences and its always brings me
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00005.flac	when i get to a bar and start drinking i mean you gotta have
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00006.flac	learned to be i've learned that being patient truely pays off it's not being patient isn't just
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00007.flac	n let her you know let her be upset for a minute and don't freak out i mean it's like ulthe ultimate like the long run just being
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00008.flac	thank you and yes they are blind in fact i'll go on record right now and say that uh that you know people magazine lost every ounce of credibility they ever had by knowing they had the opportunity to either choose me with both of these
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00009.flac	you're like oh man were jus gonna rol over these people they don't have they doncause it really is a you figure out how to play this game as far as getting artists to come over to your team
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00010.flac	they did unbelievable in in the blind auditions i mean we've already filmed all that and and there was a time or two where adem we're looking at each other like  this is this is our show
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00011.flac	just i mean he's been a coach his whole life anyway basically you know finding stars and producing records and writing songs so he's gonna do great and and people fall in love with gen
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00012.flac	the second they see her or hear her talk you know and it's gonna be a tough it's gonna be a tough year i i'm i'm really looking forward to adam lozing i don't care s so much as if i win as long as he
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00013.flac	on the on the set that day and uh and she said she goes mon i made the record i listened
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00014.flac	gdand why cant i just call it what it is you know and i i i love that i mean it
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00015.flac	it's taken as it's takeng a stand of for where she feels like she is right now
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00016.flac	uh she's great at whatever she does i i never have understood you know the concept of
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00017.flac	or cornered into a situation and and nobody can take you seriously if you step out of that zone i mean if anybody can do it it's taylor and why the hell wouldn't she do it it sounds pop we all know it sounds pop and she knows it and and it's asome i mean it's incredible so care what
id10095_sh6J3wEmceA_00018.flac	uh you'll need a pillow put in your put in your shirt let's just be honest have that thing hanging out
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00001.flac	we never planed on writing a song together  e i tell you how that song came about it was  last fall
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00002.flac	s because you know she rite you know wins a a writer and that's
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00003.flac	i bet if she could sit down and pick out her number one favorite thing to do it wouldn't be singing or fashion it would be writing music you kno and so ithiin man i need to show
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00004.flac	i can do that too you know and so i'v i started this song and and im
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00005.flac	yeah and it was like woh we wrote a song together you know buh when i say sent it to her i mean like on voice memoand f waa that's
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00006.flac	sat down in a room and and wrote that song it was just back and forth over our phones and uh and so
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00007.flac	sit down and made a little work tape of it at some point you know we were hanging out and and i played it for my sister and my mom and i think she played it for some people in her family and everybody was going on my god that's a cool song you all should record that and it's like man why screw it why the hell not we should you know it's it's a part of this story really and and so we did and i never would have imagined i hoped it would blow up you know uh you always hoped that about every song but i i never would h've
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00008.flac	thing this like living thing on its own you know after that voice
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00009.flac	was going on you know which was you know at the time  she and i were both
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00010.flac	uh you know a little bit of trust issues because we of of what we had been through n you know basical
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00011.flac	and to go im i really gonna do this again i weuh i i realy about to jump right back in to you know another relationship and
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00012.flac	i know you're going to you're gong break my heart i know you're going to so wanct you just go ahead and get it
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00013.flac	yeah because we were so excited about it we we couldn't wait to watch that thing
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00014.flac	yeah i mean we immediately after we recorded you know and and performed the song on the show uh we went back and
id10095_y3zf_LF20cU_00015.flac	you know it was one of those things where jias a little bit embarrassing and a little bit exciting you know we were having a tough time not smiling at each other while we were singings this sad song you know it's heartbreak song and uh then we had a hard time keeping he smirks off of our
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00001.flac	well first and for most al id just donena play with al and he called me up and he asked me if he i wanted you know if i 'd have any interest in playing hi
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00002.flac	thyou know what do you say of course you say yes and then i read the script and i just tought the script was just beautiful whenu just
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00003.flac	and uh and i liked crazy stupid loved very much and and he just had a really clear vision about the movie and i liked how hard he worked on it
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00004.flac	it was very cool and very  and you know and it was all's idea you know al wanted to play levene and he wanted me to play ricky roma and so he really started the whole thing
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00005.flac	it really it's it's a matter of timing really and and it' sometimes timing just works in this business and you know because we did the play together we got very close doing the play we got very close and became very good friends and and the movie came happened right afterwards and
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00006.flac	um i didn't know jenipher um uh but jenifer's a fantastic actress and she's she's a mom and i'm a dad and so you know you find things when you don't know somebody and you'reall of a sudden thrown into the fire with them you find things that you have in commen and you know we both enjoy really love being parents and and
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00007.flac	and and we just developed a really good chemistory together also because al al had
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00008.flac	so we got to know each other that way and and really the the the the atmospheere around the movie was was just cultivated really nicely by alan by dan folgleman dinners here and there and and and you know going to al's house and uh jennifer and i went with our little girl i
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00009.flac	and we just spent time together you know an the little time that we did have and um and she's just such an open and honest actress that you know i'm not surprised
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00010.flac	was a moment we wwwe did play with the ending in
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00011.flac	in terms of what we were gonna see um i i think really the big question we knew that we knew that all's character was gonna say that thing about if he calls you tom or if he calls you mdonnely what we didn't know was if we were gonna ever see the doctor again ndhow we were gonna like what what the last thing we were gonna see
id10097_FkDDTYaAq44_00012.flac	and there was a lot of discussion about that and i i really like i really like that you don't see the

id10097_VBVZKMrcmx8_00021.flac	first born uh my my first son uh my twenty yer old when he was first born um yeah and i was just auditioning and i needed  you know i had to work and
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00001.flac	wa really easy decision but really mostly it it was it was  it was an easy decision to make because of paul
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00002.flac	and it was funny cause i had i had just seen gogardians of the galexy with my son and i i was so impressed with it and i was so impressed with how funny it was
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00003.flac	you know the great characters in the marvel universe but it had this sort of weird little edge to it that i really enjoyed and and i just thought well with paull playing the
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00004.flac	i was really siked to be in um an a movie that wasn't in a superhero movie that wasn't just about flying and lifting
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00005.flac	um i i hi i think the idea of what they can do with the um with the special effects with this character is really just kind of really exciting thing um and um and of course michal dugglas playing the original dotr pym is um
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00006.flac	as and you know i mean i think you know anany time you know you gad offered a movie you know you look at all those
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00007.flac	what the story is of course and and who's involved and you know when you see people like michael douggliss and paull rud get involved i angelan
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00008.flac	um uf cory stall who i'mn a big fan of um back in new york um it was pretty easy to just throw my head in the wring and say yea i wantna be
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00009.flac	yeah so i played jim paxston and um he's a he's a police officer with thesanfrancsis co police department

id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00011.flac	um and so um my character's about to get married and he sort of formed this great little home
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00012.flac	and he's devoted to both cassy and maggy and um is pretty intent on keeping that that home uh safe and
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00013.flac	and u really a safe place for the girls and um and when we when we pick up the story here scots just gotten out of jail where he's sort of been in an out of jal
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00014.flac	that he sort of keep whatever nonsense he's involved with away from this family that he's trying to
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00015.flac	can take something that seems sort of sort of very um
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00016.flac	just qurky and uh and unlike uh unlike anything else that you would 've expected to
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00017.flac	expected to have sceen when you rwhen you read the scene um she's really really really
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00018.flac	uh really talented and really um just a creative actress and so that's always fun to  be able to get to
id10097_uPser_g8oeA_00019.flac	paton really is a is a great captain of the ship you know he's a lot of fun and you know he has some great ideas and and he's really um he's really just open to um open to us really having fun with it and really playing
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00001.flac	and the offer came in  understanding was immediately and he he went out the same day i think to
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00002.flac	and he immediately said yes so you know john had said lke we just said yes in the same week well like once you come to the end you say uh yeah please was  just briliantly
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00003.flac	it's kind of it's a it is actually a sower spot and of course that's why boy keeps twist in that
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00004.flac	i think the thing with jerry boyl is that he went in i've been trying to kind of come with to a backstory with him or i did ae
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00005.flac	hhe basically i think went into the cops with a feeling i think he grew up without a man that's my tain in the house that the mother and brought him up the father was away for whatever reason are gon tot
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00006.flac	and that he had a notion of male heroism that was kinda gleaned from movies and he kind of in some way felt that he'd be up to a guary cooper type scene in high none walking down the street against the baddies in some od idealistic way this was kind of weway he went into the guards and he saw guys in there that were kind of you know desk jockes and were just looking out the window and were you know avoiding things and turning a blind eye and maybe putting a few bob in the back
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00007.flac	an integrity u just threw it out in people's faces um so political correctness was the other thing and something like racism h he's not remotely races in my taking out but just he'l just throw it at
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00008.flac	you know not to want to hear or that inah in a way he just throws it out to see what people wil do and i think all the time he's yearning to find somebody who's gonna actually
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00009.flac	an really hard on ourselves in terms of what the standerds are like in bruse has brilliantly written script that's why it worked it wasn't because it was irish and in fact in
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00010.flac	two english guys ind actually two cockneys and martain reluctantly changed them you know when eventually that's where the casting was going to go uh cause he was hoping kind of so in fact everyodythought it wa really doubl in humor or it was really irish humor it was actually written for two cocknes now kind of martin's relationship with ireland anyway it's kind of pretty intermingled so it's all it's
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00011.flac	to continue to be that is really important we keep doing it
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00012.flac	uh i don't know we just have to work really hard though at at kindof making sure that the
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00013.flac	for stuff that actually when when stuff needs to be holled in if it's writing or if it's whatever the stuff that we make
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00014.flac	it' been puspon soso often but obviously i'm braking about it to you know it's a big chance and i have to you know after making all these statements you know i have to make sure that everything i
id10104_PW63XHWhPZM_00015.flac	the i don't leave stones unturned and then just hope hope that the magic remains in the can when we get into the edin room and finishing it so wel just hoe for te
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00001.flac	so it is the osetting i do't think he's bothered by the lack of respect um but everybody can see
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00002.flac	the number of aligations that came up with priests being rather acused for
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00003.flac	think of how horrific that must be well i again i think it's to do with more an even that one of the scenes i love in the film is where
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00004.flac	cuses him hwhat was he talking about he seemed to deep in conversation and even now as a as a middle age to
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00005.flac	that's lost and bring it to it's mother  you have to be careful about how you interact with children that you don't know there's something weird happening where that's where that
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00006.flac	a lot of situations where people are trying to break somebody but actually they're they're hoping against hope that the man won't break because really what they want to happen
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00007.flac	mean all these people a lot of these people go to mas for example why are they g ing to mas or why are they talking to him why is he so important
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00008.flac	that they want to show and to share as much u vitorol out of
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00009.flac	yeah i mean there's uh there's always a constant  shifting of the gard with all of this
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00010.flac	the usual bankers we had the politicians we had the priests we had everybody who was in a position of authority
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00011.flac	kind of certainty to people proven to be more than flawed and treturous in somein in some
id10104_T25ZT6AqU0M_00012.flac	you know a mark of i guess a an example of hope in the world so
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00001.flac	r talking we did a film together called the guard and when wewe rapped that film in the last day of shooting after the last day
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00002.flac	the notion of how difficult it must be for a good man to be a priest at a time when the cathlic church is under so much fire and uh people's attitudes towards priest so they are changing and there was a lot of pedaphilia and abuse being reported and cover up so that must be difficult to be ithis serious a man who is serious about his faith and he said well
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00003.flac	do it so he said yeah so that's what attracted me to it he wrote it
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00004.flac	ai thought little bits and pieces and that's where we went so it was fantastic to get
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00005.flac	a very profound script and um it dealt with questions in a very fearless kind of a way um which was more important
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00006.flac	asyou know he he he can write funny dialog but he write he also rites very tender dialog
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00007.flac	um needed to be at the very center of the film that it's that' they were incredibly moving um so yeah it was uh it was fantastic through you know he he he sent
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00008.flac	as i say it was fantastic that i got made in the end and i feel we've we've made the film we wanted to
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00009.flac	um i think it did yeah i mean i think i felt i knew him from the
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00010.flac	between about seven and ten or eleven uh who was an extraordinarily good man and very inspirational to a number of
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00011.flac	ah and i think i think when i lookd back at it now possibly he was a big inspiration
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00012.flac	good people you know uh over the years so i i suppose i dealte in two things i believed in as a child
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00013.flac	um to find you know there's a clarity there's a very clear faith in
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00014.flac	i mean i think that's the core of the film and you know it's a the the film is not really about aa village in ireland it's about
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00015.flac	amd the kind of disellusionment that is quite wide spread now all over the world and where people find it difficult to
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00016.flac	you know divinity or um people find it difficult to be inspired by by others anymore
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00017.flac	and i think it is a brave thing for a man to commit to something as his life's work other people then within the place and it is an interesting situation
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00018.flac	um so i mean it was a big decision that john made uh to go on location over there it's not easy to shoot there was a lot of um very bad weather and i think i'm trying to remember i think it was
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00019.flac	was at october maybe it was quite late in the year theo there a lot of storms and uh but it's magnificent and it becomes a character in the film i think in a way um so it was fantastic i mean it was
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00020.flac	uh i also think that you don't necessarily have to photograph everything that you see in order to remember it people now with iphones uh photograph
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00021.flac	ase sometimes you can't go on but you will go on i think excaves me i think that was um partly it and he's
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00022.flac	i'm starting a film now in london called suferageet which is about the sufferaget movement
id10104_skt7RVs2Exo_00023.flac	engaged with that and carry mulligan and meril streep and um hain a bundem carter an a wolle of and e whole lot of fantastic women are in

id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00013.flac	ap editorieal board and when the elevaterd doors opened and i could
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00014.flac	can understand the value of which is to appreciate
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00015.flac	word the written word the thought behind the word and the
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00016.flac	it's more true now and ah at the age of seventy three than it ever was before but it's all about
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00017.flac	named chris sweene whos still allive and uh in those days in nineteen fifty two or fifty three if you were a catholic high school lay teacher in
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00018.flac	and he decided that i should play the king nock bat i was
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00019.flac	drmatic moment that they could possibly imagine was jacke robinson turning a double
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00020.flac	in any case uh my friends in the business always say when i tell this story my god what guts what guts to do shakespeare to do mick beth
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00021.flac	in front of a group of uh catholic high school boys in brooklind in nineteen fifty three you were a brave brave man boy
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00022.flac	years later talking to chris sweeney the guy who ran that club um and i started us all off the kid's name was marius panzerella beautiful italian boy he was thirteen or fourteen e had a wonderful husky voice and he was a hell of a lady
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00023.flac	it just a just a real tough guy you know despite that beginnings
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00024.flac	ths and uh when i shut up to audition wearing my football ziper
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00025.flac	cor for u almost four years and need luss to say there wasn't much dramatic
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00026.flac	off off broadway and at the age of twenty eight
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00027.flac	long story short i mean i was working i was driving a cab i was driving truck i can't remember i maybe th i always had a
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00028.flac	and wrote this review and in those t in those days everybody read the times everybody read the times and especially the
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00029.flac	i'm except of course i didn't read the times oh i read the daily news
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00030.flac	maybe the post but anyway i came in we we'd do the shows on the weekends thursday
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00031.flac	and it was a big cast everybody was distinctly cold to me i hwhich was unusual i mean none of us were making any money i mean any money no
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00032.flac	eventually it became obvious to me that a review had been written in new york times in which i was
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00033.flac	nobody else in the play was and uh well that's a it sounds great but believe me when you gotta do another month or six weeks with a bunch of actors who re
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00034.flac	wel what you know i wasn't even and i  i was never even  much of a believer in myself in fact
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00035.flac	so i called somebody who had been from time to time my agent
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00036.flac	i that the producers or one of their representatives has to interview every equity member who wants to
id10108_gCLMDAsEsUM_00037.flac	and looking at somebody handed me a bunch of the pages and tthere were four or five different excerps one of which
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00001.flac	ut uh be part of reshooting like three episodes but um i have some very good friends here at at the holmark channel and um they
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00002.flac	been around now it's li starting our third season so i'm enjoying it i love going up to vancouver
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00003.flac	uh this fictional town of seter cove out of the invirans of vancouver british
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00004.flac	cause this are the best months up there it's so gorgious i highly recommended if you've never been come oun
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00005.flac	interesting material very different i mean there were no video games and stuff like that they were arcade game
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00006.flac	um but i think it uh it was very uh ground breaking and it was a pioneering effort and it was
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00007.flac	well we don't know if this is really gonna work but they're giving it a try and um i think what's wonderful about
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00008.flac	it has resonated all the way to this time now and here we are in the twenty first
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00009.flac	living you know the age of information uh computers um certainly the video game world which is so suppisticated now compared to the arcade games that we
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00010.flac	ai wanna think that uh maybe tron the tron films kind of uh influence that i mean that's first i've heard of that but um i don't hang out in to many bars and play
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00011.flac	games but i think there's a kindof maybe a little bit in instellget to
id10113_QgTkjSoqh7A_00012.flac	uh but maybe to go out and do it and share the
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00001.flac	uh and that episode so um  reay interesting but's well put that off for a couple season
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00002.flac	so  no what's it like iit's just uh you know that's that's the comon question hear for me
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00003.flac	it's a nice makes the two of us ecause that's mainly who i work with now in this initial part uh
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00004.flac	and and and everybody it's so great to like a new cast i'm kinda still there but this whole new cast his come in and it's kinda great to to  have these new energies and these new people
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00005.flac	it's certainly different uh  doing the animated series because
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00006.flac	created the character you gotta bring him to a voice and uh i've been saying this all day um trying to find
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00007.flac	tron's voice that was the journey that i with charlie veen our director had to do and
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00008.flac	um as unrelenting as um you will see that tron is with beck charlie was with me so i was
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00009.flac	hed was dron as a director i mean he was a harsh task master and uh
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00010.flac	an e it would keep pushing me get me angryi and angry to get that really ravaged uh
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00011.flac	of he caught a laa even the tember of his voice he caught him so wonderfully and he's a voice actor but no i think um
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00012.flac	adams a scripts and we were trying them out for
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00013.flac	much that i was hired to do the screen test with all the young prorspective hopefuls
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00014.flac	and uh this was well before we shot we actually shot  movie thre was like november before the aprel that
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00015.flac	uh i remember at that time thinking you know this is uh they hired me to do this i got the role of alen
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00016.flac	for the final film and it was actually a different scene by that anyway but so here we are now tron uprising
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00017.flac	um they're going ah liza wood we're not sure he's got a very certain timber to his voice we want to see how that sounds i'm haring
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00018.flac	hhere i am auditioning for um the voice of tron now
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00019.flac	uso it was kind of interesting and i think it worked out great um but yeah he was down i think doing the hobit fr a lot of this i mean we did shot all this we did all this all this last year and he would come back and do stuff over again we'd rea
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00020.flac	tweek this they'd do some rewriting when they ere doing the animation i never really got to see much of the animation so maybe a scene here and there
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00021.flac	and i love how they've kept true to the uh legacy world and then added some more aspects argon
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00022.flac	pin uh i do like it i  it's it i first looked at it wit wile
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00023.flac	think u there's a little animat influence there i think theuh what's hour name's character who  plays the sort of bad
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00024.flac	time ut there was always rumers uh i know steven could probably anwer that
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00025.flac	initially but we weren't into that sequel stuff yet you know it was dirard most things that kindo kick started that certainly  star wars but that was always meant to be a trillegy whe always knew that
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00026.flac	so yeah that the surprise that uh there was gonna be anything but then i did some of the vido games i i latched on to this character of tron and i wasn't gonna let go and i wasn't gonna let anybody
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00027.flac	twe all did but i embodied him at first so you know i said no
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00028.flac	um after the uh footage had been shown at commacon that went virl just went
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00029.flac	and i got tho call from shon baily and jo cazinske personally to ask me would i would i want to be
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00030.flac	i know of course i  i but i was very touched that they would calle personally instead of like a an agent
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00031.flac	so uh it was good but i think uh uh in this one
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00032.flac	i know lance hedric i lane i've always said lance
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00033.flac	a that's and lancis terific and you know whe're the two older guys in this ik yuwell
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00034.flac	litle early whell he was doing his just to make sure i wasn't
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00035.flac	o o where that i love all the way of the shot um when he reveals himself
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00036.flac	just ii in saying it uh you know i didn't see it sand only to
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00037.flac	and uh i just i had no idea wut to an vision and what did he look like that he was disfigured but
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00038.flac	th it's that it's uh pleasantly um you know you could sit there an oh my god i hope this turns out alright you know yh i have so little i had the least to do with it those poor guys that charlie and aran and like all these guys that are in the booth that i would just show up once every few weeks or whatever it was uhe
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00039.flac	we all grew up with cartoones this i to me i's not a cartoone it's an animated feature it's like for lack
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00040.flac	uh it's an animated series and it's a very logical i think extention or aspect of this whole tron mathology
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00041.flac	after all based on the whole thing about tron was in the beginning this sg
id10113_WXTLEWvPsqU_00042.flac	dturn out and i always ad this little story that in nineteen eighty two we were exempted from the oscars of the animation
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00001.flac	project uh first ofall we had nothing to relate to i mean so far as uh something like this project before that i mean animation mat paintings all those great things and we had all those people we were at the great studio that you know really was the the the epicenter of animation so um but while doing the project we did have a slight sense of uh sort of stepping out into the unknown um i think harrison ellenshow our effect
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00002.flac	uh would tell you richard taleor these guys and uh steven lisberger the creator of it all we were starting something we had that that very well um
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00003.flac	could have failed very well could have just uh not had any impact at all and that it was kind of exciting in itself you don't get to do that very often otherwise
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00004.flac	itself was pretty much you know film acting the way we do it only thatyou had to wait tremendous amounts of time in between set ups because of the lighting had to be so specific
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00005.flac	um you know theall the the it was a slower process than normally shooting and i had really come off of television more and i was used to av much
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00006.flac	so um but i enjoyed it i mean we played video games arkad games excused me they were
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00007.flac	um and ran around an our our tights and stuff like that
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00008.flac	uh uh you know jeff was listening to talking heads on his htape recorder on his belt and um uh i was roping
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00009.flac	to um doing what we do like you would do an a normal job just waiting in between and then then doing the intense scenes and then leaving or i was throwing frisbes with my coach uh sam shot that's a fun name for a guy throwing
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00010.flac	meaning years there was always uh people would come up to me and go you know um especially when i started after babwhen i started bablon five and i was going to doing scifi conventions that's when i really saw the fans and so many people came up and like i gotta tell you something that uh you know i was very much influenced by this movie you did tron and i'd start hearing tron tron tron and i realized there was
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00011.flac	a groundswell of people that uh that were very influenced by the film uh they grew up at it it was something that you know
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00012.flac	something with the suphistication an the cynnamatic quality that you have today i think dronr
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00013.flac	you noticed right now uh scifi television is very different um i'm a bit critical of it um uh it's kind of all over the place we were specifically in outer space for the most part in the nineties was outer space
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00014.flac	uh firefly or it was uh uh farscape babelon five but the the the behemoth as you say was star treck and that was the one that set the bar for all others and i'm very proud to say that we were the little space station that could and we kinda wooped its ass um i' take take avery books in ds nine i was constantly saying come on brother bring it cause
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00015.flac	andand uh so it was quite a phenomena but that show because i had done tron i actually was very well aware of the uh the green screen process or blue screen black screen whatever yo
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00016.flac	the green screen process or blue screen black screen whatever you want nto use and uh i already knew how to deal with something uh to imagine that that little piece of cross tape over there as a um a narn battleship or a uh you know a uh uh
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00017.flac	i was just known as conrad but i had been this general i pard of me it wasn't cournl ik goht brought myself down in rank uh it was this general and uh
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00018.flac	dum uh pockelipse now he kinda that's ho it was kind of was the josap conrad story of kurts ha kind of um uh he's gone off he's really wiged out and uh i actually did that for about a year off an on they
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00019.flac	finally saw it i mean the the the voice work i got to do all kinds of just
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00020.flac	and um finally saw at eveybody said  whow this is incredible you know i've got my my sons all have the game and everything and uh so um i really i've been doing mostly that i've been doing ttron uprising the animated series and
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00021.flac	well let's face it i mean nowadays it's uh come and see the the motion picture based on the hit video game
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00022.flac	wow i mean what a concept that was i mean that was a change around
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00023.flac	um so it kind of tells you that this has been a game changer all uh uh the industry recognizes now um i mean what we have r
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00024.flac	uh ofh a home video where you're going na have oh multitudinal endings and you'll be able to pick your ending or ah change in plot or something like that we'll be shooting all kinds of versions
id10113_qg0s52gex0g_00025.flac	and um uh a couple of the video game tron twoo point oh and uh what else have i done i've got two more games um
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00001.flac	you start to wonder well what am i gonna teach them what what do i want them to know and and
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00002.flac	i wanna pass on to my child and that really got me thinking about my my faith because it
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00003.flac	took the gospel message from me and it applied it personally to me so i could finally see mysel
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00004.flac	i really am a sinner that i am not this great wonderful perfect person that i always thought that i was
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00005.flac	early twenties i realized that i had a very unhealthy relationship with
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00006.flac	when i became a woman of faith and decided that this was the most important thing in my life i finally
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00007.flac	what i was eating or how i was treating my body or the amount of exercise i did or didn't do and therefore i never thought about asking god to help me
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00008.flac	maybe that's just a silly problem to be asking god about but when i realized that i was abusing my own body um with
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00009.flac	if i'm calling myself a christian and a woman that's walking in god's ways then i'm not treating
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00010.flac	exercising what my ruten was and as i was talking
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00011.flac	to so many women the conversations got very deep because i had to explain to them that yyou know really
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00012.flac	wasn't only about food choices and only about exercising but much
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00013.flac	or or bolemia but even the overeating of food um
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00014.flac	it was really god that did a change in me and a change in my mindset that tat i had to continually renew my mind
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00015.flac	need to know the word of god and we need to know the characteristics of god and we need to know how god es
id10123_QeRAaXF37a8_00016.flac	god's love would never ever change dependent apon what number is on the scale it's not how his love works but we are to honor our bodies because our bodies are
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00001.flac	toally i never dreamed of being back on the show and doing it it's even
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00002.flac	because it was  it was such a special eight years of my life and people that have been my friends since i was ten years old and
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00003.flac	it was the first time i 'd been back on the warner brother's lot in a in many many years and
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00004.flac	you all the memories come back and when i pulled up it just felt so emotional
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00005.flac	my entire childhood was brought back to me just by smelling the soundstage and then i got to go
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00006.flac	in my life i remember actually watching deb matnopolis the very
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00007.flac	to myself wow that's so intimidating she's so brave to be on there with barbera walters and i couldn't imagine talking about the things that she's talking about and politics
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00008.flac	and of course i grew up on a set and i'm in entertainment and i don't think i ever had politics on the brand i didn't really grew up in a political family either
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00009.flac	so there's two things i guest cohosted a handful of times and again wasn't on the radar that they were even looking for to have me as a permanent cohost so it was much easier going in as a guest cohost i was like
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00010.flac	no we'd like you to be permanent then i felt like oh i you know this is like a real thing now and so it put a little bit more pressure on okay you know what if i say something what if i don't say something
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00011.flac	it's a great question um i think there's so many facets to me and depending on what you're a fan of of what i've done i think people have very different view points of me cause if you're like oh i grew up watching full house or fuller house like this is one kind of fan some people appreciate me for being on the view and um
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00012.flac	mis goody two shoes and miss perfect and i'm thinking to myself i'm not trying to be and i'm certainly not but um but maybe because ii
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00013.flac	well i know it's everything because i've reached in adreams and accomplished things that weren't even on my bucket list so i i' like that's
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00014.flac	to this path because there are so many things that have happened in my life that i couldn't
id10123_ZAwqKT7EHBg_00015.flac	so important to me and you know i give all credit to god for everything because i'm he's given me all my talents all my abilities and i can utilize them to um to the best of my ability and what i choose to do is to glorify him in that way and i don't wanna ever stop doing that because i then that becomes
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00001.flac	what is this all about and yet there was something i
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00002.flac	said if anyone wants to recive crist to say the sinner's prayer with me so at that time i thought i wanted jesus christ to be the lord of my life and my savior so i prayed that sinner's prayer
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00003.flac	working on the show and traveling on the weekends to do appearances and talk shows and radio shows for publicity my church life certainly went on the back
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00004.flac	thin so highly of myself in the sense that i was a good person that i thought if the worst thing i'm doing is being intimate with my boyfriend before i
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00005.flac	that's just not that bad compared to what so many other people
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00006.flac	character that stood out to me pastor brouce barnes because in the at the beginning of the book the rapture has accured and christ has taken all of his people the left the rest have been left
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00007.flac	and in the book bruce barns knew exactly why h'd been left behind and that's because
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00008.flac	living my life the way i wanted to and just using his forgiveness as a license to do
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00009.flac	and it really woke me up and i it was that moment where i thought i need to know what the bible actually says i need to start knowing how do i know that i'm gonna go to heaven how do i know that i'm not gonna be left
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00010.flac	cause i can't simply i can't just believe in jesus but then do whatever i want living my life however i think is right
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00011.flac	understand why jesus died i understand truly that i'm a
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00012.flac	and i realized my offense before a wholy holy god
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00013.flac	and i just i would got down on my nees and i just prayd and i said lord i don't ever wanna forget this moment i don't wanna ever forget this understanding and i just pray that lord you will grow this within me so that i can become the woman you want me to become and i just wanna live my life
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00014.flac	voice on the show i've got to share on some subjects biblically which has been asome and even
id10123_wQE4ssF-vhQ_00015.flac	of being in the entertainment industry and still standing on
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00001.flac	onth the party i also it it's really fun when there's um like the heleween episode the the set was just decorated so amazing everything was just so over the top you know it was like party city just
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00002.flac	let' see yeah just  went to a halowieen house party and dressed up as a
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00003.flac	and this is something unbeknone to caroline that that um that her mother
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00004.flac	that um that her mother keeps from her and and i think attempts to protect her but it's really just driving them farther apart
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00005.flac	c where caroline and damon's relationship is going to go um i think that she' starting to realize that something's different about him she you know she doesn't know that he's a vampire
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00006.flac	guy and girl not getting along in the relationship there's something different in which you know considering that he's manipulating her mind evey chance he gets you know she's not crazy so she's just trying to figure out you know and remind herself that she's not crazy that there is
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00007.flac	and n summerholder's just a blast to work with so whenever we have those scenes we we usually get a couple good laughts out of them um before we start focassing in
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00008.flac	um but yeah you know any excuse to staire deeply into his eyes as a
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00009.flac	friend um actually took a vampire class as an uh extracuricular class at her school and um and what i found most interesting is that there are groups of people out there that feel
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00010.flac	are vampires and so and one of the things they offered like if you would like to donate blod you know after you've been tested
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00011.flac	originated way back or the thought of the vampire originated in romania way back in the day it's when it it gets so cold outside and when your body when the dead gets so cold there's sometimes happens where something happens where your body jerks up and so they'd see the
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00012.flac	the dead move so then it kind of as if they were still alive and then they were vampires i guess
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00013.flac	ot of friends now that are taking it and they and i've answered like questions for them about the show and stuff but but yeah it's really and and she legitimately got to go and interview a vampire you
id10124_5W5ODrDdRns_00014.flac	like a group of people that that practice vampireism and so
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00001.flac	to say that we will see both gentlemen try to une up
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00002.flac	but caroline is very stuck on who she wants to be with caroline wants
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00003.flac	see it as a love triangle and it's definitely painted out to be a love triangle but from caroline's perspective perspective it is very much
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00004.flac	in the first season you know sitting there across from bonnie saying why don't the boys ever choose me like i try so hard
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00005.flac	it just happens to be the mask murdering you know evil boy who is making an army of murderers um o
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00006.flac	may be not the ideal u boy to have chasing after her but um so i i think it's pretty funny but  but i can see why the viewers ae excited
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00007.flac	cause it just shows the softer side of clouse and um and i mean the boy's got an accent let's be honest
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00008.flac	caroline and stuffan had such a great friendship between season two so i think that she really has
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00009.flac	the reasons in which you know elana has fallen for him and she sees that he can protect her and bring a good side of her out and damon hasn't always been the nice guy and he hasn't always done the right thing
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00010.flac	andcaroline has become very protective of her friends and and um so yeah i think that she just
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00011.flac	ens true love so i think ultimately it would be kind of terrifying for
id10124_9STEQ4g-9R4_00012.flac	um a character even though she's become very strong but a character still as vulnerable as caroline to to open her heart to a character like steffen in which he's already so emotionally attatched to alena
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00001.flac	um i we
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00002.flac	knew um what to expect for the finaly of season six so we knew that um certain characters were departing the series and
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00003.flac	so we were i think a lot more emotionally prepared than uh the fans and viewers of the show um but you know six years in we've all worked together um so many hours and and done so many incredible things together that uh it's it's exciting to see people move on to new ventures and um and i think it's u really beautiful time for the
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00004.flac	play caroline i i don't obviously i find certain days very challenging it was a long year um the season with caroline's mother passing away in a very very sad way in a very very human way um from cancer and so that was definitely hard to come to work every day and knowing um what you know what was going on in the storylines and i just thought it was so beautifully and tragically
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00005.flac	have i learned me lessons from caroline um that it's okay
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00006.flac	to be selfish um as long as you recognize the person that you wanna be and work every day to be a better person and and so i think caroline was a very you know faulted
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00007.flac	and um but she grew into herself and that you know you have to forgive yourself and you know and and so that's i really love that about the character
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00008.flac	you know not even just as a cast but is you know our crew we've had a lot of crew members with us since season one so um you know it's a family at the end of the day i call it the traveling circus that doesn't travel anywhere and um so it's very sentimental um again like no one actually died so you know we'reall gonna see each other plenty and we're all engrained in each other's lives you know at this point whether we like it or not and and um luckily we do
id10124_INZGJqY8TBk_00009.flac	and so and it was very very sentimental but i'm excited um to see what happens

id10130_GGEFDMP36o8_00010.flac	no give us a beach somewhere a lake uh it's where we're
id10130_GGEFDMP36o8_00011.flac	i love that um um you know obviously coleisnt dik sporting goods dic sporing goods hats a

id10130_GGEFDMP36o8_00014.flac	i can see the wheels turning and you guys thinking of all the things that you know you need you know um different equipments and
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00001.flac	definitely was you know a lot better than i thought it would be just because i mean it's
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00002.flac	it was just the the song from the show you know i mean i was just kind of like a mamento for for people to have something to have out there while i was touring with the american
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00003.flac	just en listening to i was one that everybody agreed on and everybody liked so it was really
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00004.flac	things that kindaf were different on the album so if i had a lot of this type of song i definitely wanted to look for something that was more
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00005.flac	uing the show and uh so it was just kinda like alright well we'll just put this one on there and you know but um i mean it was it's a great song you know i think martina
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00006.flac	you know she's first and foremost and i just
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00007.flac	group that went in to try out so had to wait in the stadiom for i'd say
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00008.flac	theyre not gonnalet me through jes you know but um i mean everything
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00009.flac	be like you know w i sing rock musik i can go try out for american idel you know so i i think we all kind of
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00010.flac	two to three thousand i think in front of us so i've never sang in front of like ten thousand people before
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00011.flac	oh yeah and singing but that's about the only thing i don't think i really done
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00012.flac	i i knew i had to go to school and go to college and and get a degree in something and
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00013.flac	she' gonna hold a tune she's gotta a pretty nice voice but she lacked the desire to
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00014.flac	think about everybody's voice or style or music that
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00015.flac	you know this kind of music or this person or whatever so uh i'm deffinitely
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00016.flac	would say roy orbison definitely i love him and his voice and his wife and everything i
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00017.flac	pretty cool meeting me sometimes a lot of people like when a touch and hug and sometimes the'll get a little ruh
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00018.flac	m i mean just kindo random things that people like to throw things uhon when i'm on stage not bad they'll throw carbars and and stuf
id10130_Z-bPrDRGq2w_00019.flac	album and um faith hil and course raskcal flats and lone star
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00001.flac	o ie got lunch with these people like i'm gonna run by these people and say high so he's been super busy like just making the rounds saying oerd everybody
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00002.flac	know the ara that we have um our like
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00003.flac	because once i clock the in laws like it's over i suddenly become really self conscious and i'm like oh my gosh like they're looking at
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00004.flac	book or you know anything to follow like you just kinda have to figure things out as you go but um we've been really lucky just to be blessed with a baby that can kinda go with the flow
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00005.flac	he's uh he's kinda used to it i don't know if you ever really get used to it but uh he does he does as well as bette than better
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00006.flac	people enjoy seeing izr running around to because it's kinda like a they miss their kids and um you know we we definitely have lots of family that comes to different different shows as we go through cause everybody's got family
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00007.flac	there we we started working with a different like tour designer and um he uh he just had some incredible ideas i'm like oh my gosh that all sounds great you know and then once we started getting into like order of things i'd kinda start getting
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00008.flac	yean i don't know anything about like tour lighting or any stuff ananything like that that was definitely more let the
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00009.flac	um but it's it's a collaborative efort and it's a lot of fun to put together something like this so we definitely wanted to make sure that everybody just had a great could have a
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00010.flac	i'm lucky in that department um i have friends that you know are like i gotna go do my warm ups like they spend an hour warming up and i've i've never really had to do that i'm just like i don't know it's just this is what i love to do i'm just gonna go have fun with it
id10130_bWizNnWykOY_00011.flac	i'm unless i'm sick um which which does happen but i feel like i'm also like lowud so i can kinda like power through it
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00001.flac	tin lik t tha but there were no guaranties and so i came on uh at the end of season three as a rer
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00002.flac	um ii kind of did it an episode at a time uh the the casts and the crew are so supportive
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00003.flac	s i've worked with and i think it's probably the most generous warm set i've
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00004.flac	onosee how you react to it and they might ask for your imput a little bit but ultimately shonda kind of has the final word and luckily shonda has the final word because she's done a fantastic job for five seasons yeah we're ate the read through and sometimes there are gasps
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00005.flac	no you get to develop your empathy for another human being and and kind of fill them out in the most uh
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00006.flac	compassionate way you can you try and look at this person that's ttotally different from you and
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00007.flac	and you try and look at this person that's totally different from you and imagine how they could have ended up this way and  and if you had been born into their life and had lived their situation uh how how you
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00008.flac	for this role that i'm doing now because some of it is really technical and it's very sensitive i wanted to be very uh authentic and true to it and not affend anyone and and be sensitive about aboutwhat i
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00009.flac	and so i was working really closely with both the medical staff on the show and also um some former adicts who who are now recovered and um and who are
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00010.flac	addiction awearness and counseling and and so i was working really closely with with some people who had ah direct
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00011.flac	that i helped deliver was actually my my little sister uh was a u she was actually a
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00012.flac	and she had opted for a home birth with a midwife and so i was the person who was kind of there with her and experiencing this whole
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00013.flac	and me and the midwife and my mother and
id10135_Jamhv-uq4JI_00014.flac	it was this young woman and through the experience of watching her give birth
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00001.flac	thirty four or fourteen to i don't know which demographic o y
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00002.flac	yes to date this is i think yeah the highest profile definitely the the the biggest um publicity machine i've ever been a part of a lot of the work that i'd done before was in uh was out of canada and it was just not the same kind of
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00003.flac	jugger not that that you get in the states and so it's it's been kind of a whole learning curve uh but it's been fun
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00004.flac	all of those preseppositions uh it's it's not exactly it's not based on lowis
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00005.flac	it's a hundred and fifty years later um a lot of the same kind of themes and
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00006.flac	characters are in this version but they've all kind of been uh aujusted and messed with and and uh reinterpreted and so yes my character shares the name alice but
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00007.flac	uh kidnaps humans from our world and brings them into wonderland and brings them to a massive casino where they're all hooked up to these tables where everyone wins all the time and and so these kind of positive emotions like you know passion and lust and excitement and are kind of drained out of humans and they call humans oysters uh and and and these tinctures that they get from humans are used to kind of pacify the masses
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00008.flac	sheet and you see her name next to yours and you realize that you really have many many people
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00009.flac	um i shot i shot uh the movie with male first and that was directed by martin
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00010.flac	who's also great he did cacino ryal and he does a lot of fantastic action movies and so we did that in boston in november and then we shot alic
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00011.flac	her uh laboer coach and it was a really fantastic experience and so ih'd gotten really interested in mid wiffery she had done it at home with a midwife
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00012.flac	uh and so i read this book by a woman named inna ma gaskon who uh is kind of a pineer of mid wiffery and
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00013.flac	place called the farm in tence where she trained people to be midwives and had been practicing midwifery for years and so in between doing missing and moving to ela i kindo went into
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00014.flac	and and then ended up coming out to le and starting to get an agent and also assisting a midwife for a while until
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00015.flac	ofyears to be able to give birth very well our whole bodies are structured to do this thing very well
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00016.flac	occasionally there are complications but that's different from something you would normally do in a hospital which has to do with disease and pathology right and so so i think as women are learning more about their bodies uh and learning more about what they want they're starting to go oh i'm being pregnant and and having a baby doesn't mean i'm ill
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00017.flac	it means that i'm doing something that is totally natural so why would i be in a in a medical facility to do that that said thank god we have medical facilities because sometimes there are emergencies and and you need to have medical staff to deal with them
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00018.flac	natural birth is a really fantastic option that's really empowering for women and i i mean with actresses i suppose lots of actors and actresses spend a lot of time sitting arund
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00019.flac	so maybe maybe that's i don't know why but i think women in general arestarting to become a lot more interested in
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00020.flac	idea that pregnancy and birth is something beautiful and impowering and natural as opposed to something that they need
id10135_LhTB2hidBqk_00021.flac	irth especially natural birth is kind of unprodictable so if you're doing doing like a two day labor or a twenty six hour labor you'r agent can't get youo
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00001.flac	from the very i mean he's such a sentral part of amelias life he's such a cor
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00002.flac	a in every season in every episode for the rest of the show he's gonn
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00003.flac	uh at some point u no one will ever fill that voite that is always gonna be ma dreamy but um but the show is incredible it has such a life i think sho
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00004.flac	a genius story teller and she creates  these incredible multy dementional characters that you
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00005.flac	really start to develop relationships with and um and so there's this whole cluch of friends

id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00008.flac	first of all she's a genius uh and she channels something from above um but i
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00009.flac	to the industry in general and to the world in general that there are stories that we wanna hear that weren't being
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00010.flac	you know stories about uh that represent you know the world as it actually
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00011.flac	all different types of won of life and i and i think we were kind of in a situation where a lot of television was this kind of
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00012.flac	mirroring us back to ourselves and it makes us feel very passionate we're suddenly like yes those are my friends tho that's my family i wanna be a part of this conversation and so i think she's i think she just showed us what we were
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00013.flac	you know love actually they'e in the airport and it's all these like big huge moments but hospitals too i mean people are  born people are dying people
id10135_sm9vWll4smg_00014.flac	thone thing though that we often laugh about is that i think if we had been on call for the number of hours that we were often on calle
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00001.flac	there's a mystery built into it that we find out through the film that somebody in the village is a werewolf and has this double identity and everybody starts suspecting each other and we don't know who it is as the stakes keep getting higher and higher and more and more secrets and lives are unraveled you know we're just hopefully on the edge of our seats like trying to figure out what's the answer to this mystery and can we solve it before someone
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00002.flac	there's a mystery built into it that we find out through the film that somebody in the
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00003.flac	is a wearewolf and has this double identity and everybody starts suspecting
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00004.flac	the day our movie starts we'v we're with um our lead character which is valery and
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00005.flac	true love have just found out that her parents want her to marry somebody else so they are plotting like maybe they're gonna run away and leave right at the moment when they could be leaving this town they find out ththetere
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00006.flac	for the first time in twenty years the wolf has killed a human that sets off a whole chaine of events where we start to discover what's really going on in this town what is at
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00007.flac	in many countries all around the world people hear this story and a lot of times we've heard it in a sanitized version because a lot of people now take fairy tales okay let's make it like clean it all up and take out the messy bits and just make it a tale like don't talk to strangers like do what mommy says that's not the point of fairy tales they do go into the darker elements and that's why theyve stuck with us and made us
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00008.flac	and and helpe us through different parts of our life actually
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00009.flac	um learning about something maybe when you're five red wriding hood means one thing to you when you're seven you start understanding on a different level and even when you're a teenager you respond to it on a
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00010.flac	in the world people hear this story and a lot of times we've heard it in a sanitize
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00011.flac	when i thought about red wriding hid i mean first of all the way o mandal
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00012.flac	is straight out f a fairy tale she's got the most amazing eyes that just
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00013.flac	so like she is other worldly almost and i think that just i felt like her emotion
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00014.flac	brand new i guess it's almost his first movie um and he's also just got a lot of heart even though he is the choice of the parents
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00015.flac	yo keep thinking i thought when i read the script oh my god he's he's pretty cool may maybe he's the right person to be with i was getting
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00016.flac	and you know how has this person been hiding for twenty years how can we not figure it out what are the clues
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00017.flac	including valare or trying to figure this out and then the outsider comes in garry olman's character with his team of people and they're trying to really get to the bottom of this find out who's
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00018.flac	of the wolf was was one of the k elements in this movie and one thing that we really labored over a bit because this is a creature that is absolutely mysterious we don't know if it's a male or female we have this beast come in we don't know the powers of the beast it's a legend it
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00019.flac	have any kind of powers so we didn't want to like give it all away at the beginning
id10136_5V5-S_yF8kI_00020.flac	of this creature you wanted to see it do part of the attack and then can it can it kill more is it more powerful than that so it's like a slow reveal of what
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00001.flac	she was a co pilot you know helping us but i did have a little apprehension about taking on the project which deals with such a heavy subject that you wanna be respectful of it but we also
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00002.flac	fun in a way to show that even if your best friend is having a tough day you can  come in and lift him back up with a joke
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00003.flac	well uh my dad had cancer and every day he would grack these wicked jokes and i thought
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00004.flac	i thought that's the kind of thing we need to do where the people that are involved are still able to be funny and have a great sense of humor and so i think that's that's the
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00005.flac	well i was lucky that she'd actually read the script before i even knew about it so she already
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00006.flac	ferless actress i mean she will dive into anything a hundred
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00007.flac	sick and i knew that tony would do that cause i mean look at her body of work it's incredible and then when she came on akay could we get dr
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00008.flac	you know i i love dominite coopers work for a long time i've sehis
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00009.flac	duble and all kinds of things and i just thought he would be so interesting in this movie and like this rock and roller that's turned into a pretty cool dad and you know again we kind of had to rewrite a little bit to lur him in and then
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00010.flac	you know everything and i just loved him and he's very soulful
id10136_Tw8MDjbmh2M_00011.flac	ventional girl thats doesn't wanna fit in really but everybody else wants
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00001.flac	u decaprio's company they had the idea of like taking h putting the weare wolf back in it which was in the old version of it and that added this whole layer of murder
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00002.flac	to the story which i thought was intriging that someone you know has a darkside someone has a secrept you know is a murderer and you know in the middle
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00003.flac	iters killed and so her world his turned upside down and that just kind of drew me in
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00004.flac	dis yeah i mean a novel like um twilight of course had readers all over the world that knew every single detail but this
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00005.flac	you know is a very short little story and there's all kinds of versions of it so there was not like one
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00006.flac	o this so there was more room i think for the writer's imagination for my imagination the actor's imagination to really take
id10136_nev-br2cThg_00007.flac	um you know i i love shiloh i met him you know in the twilight audition process and he was one of like the top four choices like bachelor number one two three and four and of course rob

id10139_uRMqxpuLlVg_00021.flac	you know i i after a  few beers li yeah i kinda come to a a little bit you know i i grew up in okl homa and then and then uh going out to new york for seven years you know andand and back
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00001.flac	o what he said i mean i don't know but what what he said is is that you know i was the most corageous i actually didn't know that i heard him saying that uh
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00002.flac	ininterview and i was like oh that's what that's what it was you know i thought i was i was the most hansome
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00003.flac	but at the same time it was it was fun i mean like i didn' i didn't think about it from that point of view like yeahi i i try to find a way of uh
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00004.flac	and i felt pressure mostly from the family you know not
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00005.flac	or they they were really like you know overbaring at all but i just
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00006.flac	do well by them uh when i first when i met rachel robinson the first time i just i i she's a regal woman
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00007.flac	she was like a grandmother   in that first meeting
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00008.flac	it certain moments along the way you felt i felt that from e and i just wanted
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00009.flac	um you know they didn't get this right about about jacket i mean they could they could say it but i felt like it
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00010.flac	we don't we don't necessarily know that that moment in the tunnele happened but it had to happen she andthe fact that she didn't you know so you gotta take that ot ofthe script he never broke down like that he never had a moment where he was
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00011.flac	it's important to have that moment in ta movie
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00012.flac	the whole story like that he gets to that point and then he goes
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00013.flac	you know you have to have your space that's what you do i mean you you have space before the scne you have your space after after the
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00014.flac	you know cause it'sit could be dangerous for you it could be dangrous for me um so
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00015.flac	you're given given that protection and i think they provided that so that you could get the most real experience
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00016.flac	you know i'm sure i'm sure he did but i felt like the film gave you the right amount of it so that you can enjoy the other parts because one of the things that that rachel robinson said to me is that
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00017.flac	remember the the darker moments of that time but the the joy that we found with
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00018.flac	and and sometimes that's the irony of life that during the most difficult moments you look back on it and you realize how much you enjoyed it you know how much you can celebrate it
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00019.flac	you're um you sircle those scenes on on the scedul and the say
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00020.flac	you know that's what it is so i i just looked at it as as you know this is why you play to g
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00021.flac	well you learn from his experience i mean there's certain things that you can ask him that are that that you don't
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00022.flac	it would be a it would be a foolish thing to not ask him you know certain things about how to do that so i asked him small things at moments and then  other moments i just watched him on set i watched how he uh
id10140_1fpTDuFfoB0_00023.flac	i watched um you know the way that he understood how things moved around him
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00001.flac	and when you go through like ther verious writers um and you
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00002.flac	um and at the same time he's the superhero but he's not quite a superhero um
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00003.flac	that he has this this quality of of being very
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00004.flac	you never know quite what he's going to do next so he's always a step ahead of every one
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00005.flac	agenda his own world that he has to protect he has his own linage that he has to live up to
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00006.flac	take orders from iranman he can't just take orders from cap um
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00007.flac	the the value in both sides but he's not gonna tell them that you know what his what his what his belief is or what his interest is so he's the car that you have to figure out
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00008.flac	curent situations to ad to the story um so it makes it topical
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00009.flac	for me first off i wanted to be true to to the comic book
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00010.flac	that i try to bring to the table that are pulling from
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00011.flac	u trybl history or um tribeism
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00012.flac	you know african civilization they're things that i'm always doing
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00013.flac	the the decorations here and they theyit's all it's almost like their weapons here as well um around
id10140_UY78OKD1Ps4_00014.flac	and you see aspects of the ninga as well so i i love that you can look at it in one moment and see one
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00001.flac	i don't know if the word is win it was uh it was some weird sign sort of that that it was gonna happen i mean maybe like a year before um
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00002.flac	it accurd i you know i've been thinking about the character cause that's what
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00003.flac	i got in a conversation with you know the security on set for uh this movie called gods of egipt in australia and we didn't even really talk about black panther at all but he had
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00004.flac	then put um the first issue of black panther his original issue from when he was a kid in my trailer and wrote a note and said um you're gonna get this
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00005.flac	um a black panthern movie or even brinng the character to the universe and he i was like okay you know
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00006.flac	sorta put it out my head and then it just sorta became this thing that built in my head that you know maybe this could happen started researching the character more and i was on a set i was on the uh red carpet actually
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00007.flac	agent called me and the weird thing about the call is that i didn't even have an international plan on my phone until
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00008.flac	and somehone said guess gods sa uh you need
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00009.flac	anhe was like yeah  i said i'm onna red carpet  he was like well they're they you get off the red
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00010.flac	so i did the red carpet i got off and got in the car and drove around cause it was a secret conversation and um we they basically were like hey we heard
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00011.flac	and they were like you know if it's the character we think you're interested in would you be interested in
id10140_bLQavRhiCzo_00012.flac	there's there's a casting director buy anane of sara fan i think she had a sense of it somehow um but yeah it was definitely one of those eri um
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00001.flac	that i i i saw how i could play a character who is scared to fight
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00002.flac	really jumped off the page and then the setting of doing a high school movie i mean i i love gh
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00003.flac	perhaps the most intimidating confrotation of his life and he has to become a little bit uh
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00004.flac	great thing about us working together on this is that we we sort of i think we share a very similar vision for what the movie should be so we're
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00005.flac	maybe the scene should accomplish this or accomplish that and we're never too far apart in an what our visions are of
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00006.flac	uh both in the scenes sometimes but but uh behind the camera because uh he's so cool and collective usually that uh it's tough to break through that exterior so it was nice when i got the cance
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00007.flac	well first and formost we'll start with tracy morgan who uh we're all very grateful is happy and healthy and working again
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00008.flac	and uh this was his first uh acting job uh back and uh
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00009.flac	he was both very uh grateful to be on set but also very uh excited and almost nervous at first
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00010.flac	and and getting to be uh caught up in the middle of that storm
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00011.flac	is a lot of fun because there's a million funny things that happen both on set and off i often would say i just wish we had a camera rolling on him at all times and we could just cut some of these comments into the movie here and there because uhhe's not
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00012.flac	and i was thrilled to be in the movie and both riche and i beged her uh to be in this um yhi i think is uh a rising star and um and anything she
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00013.flac	turn to comedy gold o on the set uh a million different sort of uh ways
id10144_3GwaTALapW4_00014.flac	to do the scenes and uh for me it was very fun to have the dinamic with her
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00001.flac	i really just enjoy working with with jason uh bateman and jason sadacus and and i knew that we'd have a lot of laughs on set and if we could come up with a story
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00002.flac	nine years of television so the idea of like coming back with the same characters to me is not u shocking you knowi'm surprise we don't
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00003.flac	think that i liked in the first movie and i'm i'm hoping it's the same uh in the second movie just uh littleat
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00004.flac	when these three idiotes try and do any kind of crime uh breaking into a house or even breaking out of a house uh uh you know the next morning uh
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00005.flac	um hscenes with these guys in the car uh trying to figure out how to pull off things that they have no capacity uh to pull
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00006.flac	and they're two of the funnest guys i've ever met in my life so uh it's it's fun to be around funny
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00007.flac	i think you just have to continue the story you know we didn't wanna just do the same story again we didn't wanna do the same story again witha
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00008.flac	it's uh to me it's always like alright what's next what what could they get into next so um so i i didn't find it daunting to come back to this i think uh i was just happy to check back in with the characters and see what's going on with their lives and then see you now what kind what fun thing can we get them into
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00009.flac	ostart their own company based on this product uh that they came up with um
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00010.flac	so he really uh he really is h sort of taking a big uh risk at the top of the movie and and you're you're seeing him in a situation where clearly he needs that to work out because he has a family now
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00011.flac	we're joined by christpine and christof walts in this movie uh they play a father and son uh who have invested in our company and they're they're real one percenter types you know um and this is our character's opportunity to
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00012.flac	sort of achieved the american dream and and uh so they get into bed with these
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00013.flac	his negotiating tactics have have not improved and what's scary is that he wants to buy  and run a business as well you know he's sympathetic to our situation and this is not a man who should run a business i mean
id10144_SrpBcop7aFU_00014.flac	occasionally suggesting what kind of crime to do uh so
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00001.flac	ak hank himself is iyah dea noras the incomportable dean noras
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00002.flac	well anny campbel is a he's a people pleaser he's he's mr nice guy he just wants everyone to be happy he's he's a a a little too soft on his his uh students he's probably been voted most popular teacher occasionally uh and probably gets offt on that you know i think he likes he likes everyone to like him and he hates conflict um and of course uh
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00003.flac	the students walk all over him and uh he just takes it and um
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00004.flac	yeah yeah no it was it was really fun for me to to be reacting to jillian bill or reacting to tracy margon or comal and johny and uh you know i
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00005.flac	in being sort of the eyes of the audience which is that like i were you seeing what this persons saying this is not
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00006.flac	uh so that that's a fun and a different sort of gear for me to opperate in and then oof course he gets to just go fulllunatic
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00007.flac	ii i love how i collective the cast s i love how diverse the cast it is um
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00008.flac	and you know i think that was important to riche and i uh when wewere working on putting the movie together we wanted to get
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00009.flac	thn you know um when we got jillian bell that character wasn't even written as a woman at first and we said what if we write it for jillian bell because she's
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00010.flac	you know a super talent and then uh the chance to get tracy morgan back in his first movie uh since the accident and that he was healthy enough to work again and uh to give him that opportunity but then for us to get the opportunity to have him i mean he was very thankful for being there but not as thankful as we were to
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00011.flac	i mean just those two guys alone and comail who i think is just one of the funniest people on the planet i know a lot of people know him from scilicon valle but uh i mean he's just everything that comes out of the guy's mouth is histerrical and then even to get like de noras from breaking bad or like dennes haysbern just to pop in and say a few things i mean the cast really came together in uh one of the best ways
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00012.flac	such a big fan of ice cube i always have been a i i started as a fan of him uh in music and of course uh then like boys in the hood which i'
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00013.flac	blew my mind when i saw it and then um you know everything from like three kings to friday i mean i'm just a big fan of ice cube but like i can also i know like all the lerics to a lot of his songs yho woulna think it but i do um and so uh i it was just i like a surreal moment for me you know i was telling him stories about things that i had done as a kid where i was like listening to his music at the time which i'm sure it's od for him to
id10144_lRVeUceR3Z4_00014.flac	great to get to work with him and then really strange for my son who at the time was only three to say uh dady are you are you working with your friend ice cube isa something i never thought i would hear my child
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00001.flac	get the scene so i was in this position of trying to find the you know the place where nobody would say
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00002.flac	i didn't want to be able myself to be able to compare the words with what he had
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00003.flac	and uh i read stuff and maybe i could have
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00004.flac	not my father's presence but you know it was like everybody knew what i had in my head
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00005.flac	because i wasn't composing any music and i was trying to write
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00006.flac	able to be there whilst they were creating something and instrument after instrument it was
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00007.flac	such a magical time for me and with nigal behind the
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00008.flac	just talking to nicola and jon binwa for such a long time because i was so scared to start something that i wanted to talk about what it was going to be like and what kind of music and the words were so important for me so
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00009.flac	weren't happy we could go on and that was a a great
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00010.flac	th a scd with all the tracks and then just go in the studio and record it i wanted to be there
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00011.flac	judgement he had on on the lirics mainly for me he was a great
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00012.flac	intimidated at first especially once the music was
id10145_qZQZ_6Vv23s_00013.flac	not finished but there were times when i had to try and put my voice on i was so embarrassed
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00001.flac	put my hopes you know i didn't want to hope too much that he was just going to
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00002.flac	going to read so it was all the surprise and yes of course quite
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00003.flac	there would be two of us playing jo so i didn't know when i came in
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00004.flac	again not understanding as as it was the same the same with antycrist i i wasn't sure i was getting all the digressions and all the metiphors and
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00005.flac	aa lot of the work for me was to understand what what both characters were saying even though joe doesn't really understand what's
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00006.flac	is going on about all the time but still it was interesting for me
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00007.flac	so hat can i say it's just very scary and
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00008.flac	umseeing the film as a whole i have absolutely no
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00009.flac	the fim it's that it's a film about flesh and the
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00010.flac	just to know what my limites were in terms of moral
id10145_sgDSwkc5ygk_00011.flac	tes character but i feel that he's putting himself into
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00001.flac	well i mean but you have to build the show nobody just gets up there and does it you know people don't realize when you see chris rock and you see all these guys on tv uh that's material that's been tried and true and and worked and reworked and uh you know before chris goes out and does a to ou uh uh special for tbo and all these guys they're on the on the road for six months putting all this together and then what you see is the best of
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00002.flac	ye exact that's the beauty in it but it's extremely hard anybody who thinks he cauld be as everybody thinks so oh you're funny you should be a stand u
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00003.flac	oh my god you're so funny really go on a stage with twelve strangers ith late at night they're a little drunk they're in a bead mood go make them laugh go head now tell me how good you are
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00004.flac	commedian today obviously is chris my favorite stand up comic all time i thought t was richard prir
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00005.flac	but he was the first to bring actual stories and make them
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00006.flac	you know to me richard prirs you know i mean i have some  robin williams i think it
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00007.flac	he was so fast i i was just fascinated by him i i mean you know eddy merphy and all those guys i mean they ow a lot to richard i think because richard was just i mean i saw that that special and i remember people people
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00008.flac	standing up having to stand up and walk to the ile cause they were laughing so how they could not sit down i remember
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00009.flac	yes but i think he was you know he just he just broke ne ground and he was he was my favorite favorite
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00010.flac	well how could you not be i mean you know like you know there are certain people that come along in lifetimes who change ethey change the game you know
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00011.flac	uh you know he did richard did you know uh marlam brando did in the fifties and and then it wasn't changed again till robert denero did raging bull in the
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00012.flac	you change a style of acting you change where actors gaine the weight and did all that it's it's those people that you have to
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00013.flac	o i saw all a lot of his shows in fact that i thought they were just terrific all of them
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00014.flac	a linea story see most stand up su most one man shows they do a character then they talk to the audience they break the fourth wall where this was where bronx tale on stage was a liner movie all the characters straight through without stopping that's why that that was a a
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00015.flac	not on not on tape ye no no i will i am gonna film it i was gonna do it i  recently i'm
id10146_3GpKr8kPlsc_00016.flac	it was on broadway and than i just did it in las vegas at the uh
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00001.flac	yes and i was a band i was in a band clo razmajas and we worked
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00002.flac	on of the places uh i used to work at the concod hotel many years ago up in the cat skills and
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00003.flac	ow did you bring it back after all these years and the reason why i brought bronxtaile back was because when i first did it it was such a phenomenon and everybody loved it so muchha
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00004.flac	get a chance to really perform it for a long time i did it um in ilay for a few months then i
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00005.flac	in new york for like four months to esold out audiences and for all these years for the past almost nineteen twenty years people have been saying i love the movie i love this movie but i saw the play oh the play was great so i thought about it and i said you know what there's a whole new generation of people who never got a chance to see it i'm gonna bring it back and i decided to bring it back and i got back on broadway and it was a bigger hit than it was when i first did it
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00006.flac	great movies right out of the box and and you know kind of three classics that are people still remember so i you you asked me what my favorite was other than bronx tale which is obviously my favorite i would have to say bullets bullets and usual subspects though and you know what i did a a film called guy to recognizing your sants that i really love with shi lebo and channing tatam and robert downny junor that came out
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00007.flac	it didn't really get a lot of uh attention it got great reviews but it didn't do great at the box office but it'still a great movie and i really like it i ely
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00008.flac	haven't had a chance to work with marney and i know him i met him and i got to know him through bob die nero but i never got a chance to work with him yet for whatever reason but and i hope
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00009.flac	there's this movie called safe which was written by richard viteria that i'm producing that i'm gonna play uh the lead character edde uh that's one uh i'm trying to think and there's another one
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00010.flac	a movie called the oge loves ogeit's about for kids and i love doing animation but this wis more than animation this is actually i'm
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00011.flac	i'm gonna be doing a movie right after this uh called exit one o two in jursey
id10146_jkpEEFySgIY_00012.flac	you know i enjoy it i have a great time you know uh get a chance for my wife and my children uh to come
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00001.flac	i started out as a singer actually in a duop group so uh i really connected with te
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00002.flac	he usual suspect so i'm known for those movies but this is a departure
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00003.flac	now all of a sudden it's too oh eight and we broke we have no money so we decided to pull off a job so i think the relationship we had was
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00004.flac	shel i yes i am a rigter i am a director and yes i have strong opinions on all movies that i
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00005.flac	director and the writer let me do it and sometimes they just wanna leave it the way it is but im i'm confident enough that if i can give a suggestion they take it but always i always remember that in the movies the director is the captain of the ship and he's the one who makes the final
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00006.flac	say so but i i have uh helped rite some of the movies that i've been an not this one
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00007.flac	i wanted to write something about the working man all these mophia movies that glamorizse the wise guys
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00008.flac	they  it was bothering me so i wanted to talk about the working man you know the etalian american community is really just made up of the working people the bakers the fireman the
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00009.flac	little aberation in the etalian american community so i want to talk about learenzo palmantery who said the working man is the tough guy i'm the tough guy it doesn't take much strength to pull a triger but get up in the morning and i wanted to create that theme and talk about a bronx tale so to me a bronx tale is a movie
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00010.flac	you're instinctual you train and you do the best you can and the way i kept them separate was i had to make each person sound
id10146_zRXyp-yH3Uo_00011.flac	ters the father spoke a at a low register sonny spoke at a very high a higher register wbuth more of a stronger bronx accent so that's how you really do that so if you have three or four of them speaking at once the audience can know who's talking
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00001.flac	ta keeps the book from being tabloied and honest it's not like when i peet in my pants wheni
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00002.flac	kids in like chinese costumes and dragons and candy and and we went in this room and and the big curtain went up and then there were all these animated characters dumbo and his
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00003.flac	wel kno they but they're all good things but t i don't wanna tell it because i want you to read
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00004.flac	help him with his car and we would talk and he was really nice and then when his friends would come over to visit him he would just tell me to run along so this one time he invited me to go well let me let me set this up he would come to my house and we'd watch tv and we'd kiss but he was always trying to get me to do more things and i just didn't want to i wasn't ready so um
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00005.flac	he invited me to go to dinner and my mom said it was alright cause my mom didn't like me going out in cars with guys that were older my mom sad it was allright and i was so excited and just as we were getting ready to go his friends came up and he said oh sheare thanks for helping me you can run
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00006.flac	the stout this makes me se like a terrible person but you know i was only fourteen and hal
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00007.flac	ad we used to go to this he liked to play hooky from work and so we used o go to this
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00008.flac	we'de known each other for a long time well  not a long time but i mean a while he decided that he liked me at this time and well one day we're at this park and this guy's playing really bad saxiphone next to us and like just blowing himself up you know he's like just loving himself to death
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00009.flac	yeah i guess so  is you know so i mean that's just it's nothing it's nothing story you
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00010.flac	and the guy was blowing the bad saxs the people were in the park playing frisby dog frisby and
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00011.flac	and he was he was married he was getting a divorce and i wasn't eighteen
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00012.flac	we had a wedding ceremony i performed this wedding ceremoney in our bathroom
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00013.flac	bbefore the sony and sher show and after i got you babe we were litterally in the toilet we owed the government two hundred and seventy thousand dollars and i had just had cha
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00014.flac	and there was no more record sales there was no you know huge arenas with
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00015.flac	and but meanwhile we had to go play these horrible places
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00016.flac	and it was awful and soddn i had made the mistake of telling sonny once that i knew a song from madam butterfly
id10148_IXrZP_6JUdA_00017.flac	t's it jut woul just not working so that night a woman comes up to me after this year and she said you know i came all the way from i don't know where
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00001.flac	no it was like one of those times where you know my grandmother was very you you're very young and you've got this fabulous future ahead of you and you're not
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00002.flac	and the only job my mom could get was uyou know working in an all night diner for tips and she
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00003.flac	i kind of did from the from my first film you know the first time my my mom took me to the movies and i just thought i'm gonna do that when i
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00004.flac	he was hansome and funny and very intelligent and a torific actor and
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00005.flac	and i know what he had on i know the watch the shoes every single thing and
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00006.flac	also i get really shy and he'd say sher it's just me for god's sake just do it
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00007.flac	and something really to look forward to because by that time our career had tanked and and we were just about to have togo
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00008.flac	and that was playing all these really horrible nightclubs
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00009.flac	and the people disliked us so much in the beginning that we would have two shows at night and no one would come to the second show so we would just start entertaining the band and that's where we started just
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00010.flac	ththe strange thing is was that as partners we got along so well
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00011.flac	the male personality and even discovered a few new ones you are physically repulsive

id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00014.flac	people are kind of afraid of strong women which is so wrong because
id10148_UUcLJLMw8u4_00015.flac	you just can't because you are that person you can put layers you can put ne cloths you can do all kinds of stuff but you are the person that that you are the inside is what you are you can polish the outside but the inside
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00001.flac	i wanna i like like i just wrote a script with a friend of mine for

id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00003.flac	this but it does this album does have a lot of a lot of effects on it and it's just
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00004.flac	i got up first you get great songs and i think i manage to do that this time i think i managed to get
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00005.flac	you know i mean because i i do what i do and it's all well ind
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00006.flac	it's not rocket sience it's just something you know but i i believe that i believe that it's a
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00007.flac	and it's kind of diffmy process is difficult i wish it wasn't but that's it just i am who i am so
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00008.flac	make it probably more difficult than i need to but i do there's a certain part that i enjoy
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00009.flac	some of it but i i like i like whan it's done i like having
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00010.flac	and i actually enjoy certain things i really enjoy while i'm doing them and many things i enjo
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00011.flac	three or four i would probably pick um li o me my love
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00012.flac	i don't know i hope you find it it's hard though because all of them they're they're really different and i like them for different reasons you know dresed to kill is just stupid and funny and
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00013.flac	camp and you know kind of playful and not trying to be anything serious the only song that really i'm like sirons is serious um i hope you find it is serious light of me is serious
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00014.flac	songs anyway i like you know i have a big voice i like to use it and and i just put it out there i'm not putting it out as
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00015.flac	relationship with it you know it's like because music doesn't it by passes your brain and goes right to that inside place
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00016.flac	well the tour is next um wellm it's not next but it
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00017.flac	like when i was writing the script when i was runnin andi wer running the script i was like
id10148_nqDj3Sa7IOA_00018.flac	all i could think about that's all i could do i'm kind of the person i'm just i
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00001.flac	uh i think his outobiography is a real testment to him and his soul and his ability to withstand this extraordinary experience and that lion exactly that lion when he's hanging from the tree and he and he has this moment when he is lake well h many years later where he's writing about that moment and it just goes to show i think the depth of his soul
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00002.flac	think it i it was in that moment in the book that i realized that he was kind of he had a
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00003.flac	and actually doing that scene and doing the stuff around the he with the tree and the and the
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00005.flac	think it's h just uh i i think what steve has is uh i ii don't think it's a a racial issue exactly i think that steve is um an exceptionally talented
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00006.flac	and i think that that really came into play in this i mean i'm sure that he is connected to the material in a very strong way being from you know his heritage is from the west indies and of course there was a massive trade in the west indies in slavery but uh and that's probably one of the reasons he was drawn to the material but i think that his strength um with this is is the same as his strength in hunger and in shame i think he's just a
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00007.flac	the the levels and the layers in the society you know the the industry of it all which is why in this you know we have um you know solemon starts off
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00008.flac	inthe timber and well you know going and and cutting trees and trying to and rafting trees down the down the swamps and the marshes in uh in louisiana and then he goes into
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00009.flac	and this thes sort of society of that as well and there are surprising characters alfre woodad ind the film playing mistress show is a very interesting and surprising part of the whole infrastructure and um and i think that that's what the book and the that's what the film gives us it gives us a whole section of that society and uh and the industry and the machanics and the
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00010.flac	tha lot of the information is out there you know um i don't know if we were specifically taught about slavery when i was in
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00011.flac	uh i don't know if uh but it's something that obviously growing up is something that i have um taken on and looked at in many different ways in many different parts of um times in my life and and um and in different places you know um not only the west indies and obviously britain's relationship to that but
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00012.flac	uin africa inigeria is where my heritage is and and where a lot of slaves came from um so it's always been something that has been of great relevance to me um um
id10151_Ru9iWYwJSa4_00013.flac	looked at uh not just in the american slave issue but the kind of global ramifications of that i think it was ai mean slavery was such an international event uh that affected the entire diasporant and still
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00001.flac	um to the biography because i thought that if i if tey hadn't i would have heard of this story i thought it was uh it was such an extraordinary story um such an amazing story so kind of uniqke in its
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00002.flac	and uh and so powerful and and rich and you know this first hand account of these events is um from so deep within the slave experience was just uh
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00003.flac	know it and so i was very surprised to then read the book and realize that they hadn't made this sismic change and and it was very
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00004.flac	to the way that it's written which is actually very instructive about him somehow and you sort of really get a sense of who he is um and that kind of quietness
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00005.flac	well there was the sort of in a way there was um obviously the the just the detail in the book was very significant but there was also something just about the wider
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00006.flac	uh and itand it was something that just sort of tied into the book in a way and um you know just
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00007.flac	of sugercane the industry of of cotton um was just to understand where in the world he was
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00008.flac	sort of deopolitical finnancial reality and and circumstance of of slavery of the slave trade and the relationships there
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00009.flac	and and circumstance of of slavery of the slave trade and the relationships thereby between africa and and europ and america north america and south america it was just a very fascinating kind of way of
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00010.flac	a more inventive and kind of dispicable maze of of getting slaves down to the south so there was something there and then it was just a question of sort of narrowing in the book was incredibly helpful and nd um and then just really even just learning the violin was just a way of you know of really kind of uh
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00011.flac	you know um i just thought ts unlike anything i'd seen before uh and and and shame i thought t was brilliant and so i was very excited i spoke to him after hunger not
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00012.flac	and and it was uh we talked bout life and films and and wanted to work together on
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00013.flac	so this was an amazing sort of coming together of that journey you know after um after a few years and um and the experience of working with him was uh absolutely remarkable it had it was an intense experience you know uh but athat's exactly what it kinda needed to be um in a way there was only in a way thathat was the only way to tell solemon's story is
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00014.flac	ou kno extraordinary ever since we kinda opened in to tari and tronto
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00015.flac	it's beenan an incredible kind of journey with it and and and to be able to to talk to people in depth about it and to and and also people teach you about the film by the way that they respond to it and the conversations that they want to have about it and that's been incredible as well and so it's the whole process has been this really gratifying journey and and and and or any of the
id10151_ZvvN51PkKGk_00016.flac	it jus it's kind a part of the same thing i mean it's already been this kind of amazing amazingly
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00001.flac	when i finished reading i was really kind of almost uh surprised at how much michael had stayed with me through it
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00002.flac	uh and i realized that actually he was just a very just a very special character a very um determined guy but is you know just very um compromised all the way along compromised um by his situation compromised by the um the work that he's doing uh for the for the russian mob essentially compromised because of his family
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00003.flac	michel is somebody who has a deep desire to to be
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00004.flac	uto teach you son certain things but has a life that is which means that he's has totally absolutely no control over
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00005.flac	no uno a way of really of really being a proper father to his
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00006.flac	um and therefore kind of carries that section of the story in a certain way and uh and we go on the journey with him we understand when he's when he's compromised and we feel the walls coming down around
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00007.flac	uh he's also himself an ex cop but him being russel's brother means that there's a certain offinity therefore between michel and gabe which the others don't have and um um but he's also he can be a bit of
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00008.flac	it's always great when you have a director like that who is uh talented and also incredibly personable and carismatic because you know it sort of aeffects
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00009.flac	nengaged by somebody in you know a rehearsal just sitting around
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00010.flac	in the hotel reading bits of the the script and feeling you know just so incredibly well prepared nd extraordinarily well preped and
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00011.flac	and just uh just generous with it you know ready to kind of give it all and to um and to and to really get in
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00012.flac	and and john hillcot obviously it just uh just sort of capturing moments you know uh uh and it sort of just started to feel very organic and very sort of very
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00013.flac	every single person is not only ring to be talented as an as actors and have
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00014.flac	journes as actors like totally different journes just as people you know um but uh but a completely
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00015.flac	carismatic en determined you know and exciting actors to watch and be
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00016.flac	aam po i mean i mean he's great and uh and he's i mean constantly been putting out these great
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00017.flac	and so now with this again the kind of opportunity to play this sort of
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00018.flac	the guy that's kind of a little bit off the wall hard to pin down and he really embraces all of that and really really
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00019.flac	you know and ah and a and a jovial um sense of the world you know which uh which is just above this kind of very steely very serious kindo energy this very kind of uh very determined working
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00020.flac	o and he can have that sort of juality which i find exciting and almost mecurieal
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00021.flac	and so him playing frankco is just you know just perfect you know this kind of you know this totally morally compromised cop
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00022.flac	deeply kind of complex guy that you feel as huge amount of emotion for that you're kind of um that you're you're right with him every step of the
id10151_vzpS-gWG2D0_00023.flac	you know that the uh that you don't that you're supporting one character for a moment and then it twists around and you're in somebody else's pocket and you're feeling different things about different people all the way through the
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00001.flac	geek booth babe she gets payd to do this i best she doesn't even know what
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00002.flac	make her costume i know the girl who made it what is she doing cosplaying is this
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00003.flac	meif i told you that a lot of this comes from other cosplayers on
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00004.flac	uh i will be on a show called heroes of cosplay that will be airing on the scyfy channel it is essentially a reality show about cosplay the reception so far in the cosplay community has been
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00005.flac	is done doing that because they're kind of realizing that weare actually taking over the world video games are making more
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00006.flac	but people are so protective they're so protective of
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00007.flac	afraid to post things on line because of how cruol people can be and i'm not talking about the trols i'm talking
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00008.flac	my apologies why are you apologizing for something you haven't posted yet because you know hit's a dic thing to say everyone has the intuition if you are thinking there is no reason i should post this it's going to hurt their feelings then don't post it not just on behalf of myself but on behalf of cosplayers out there
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00009.flac	at you want that you may not have been able to otherwise if you didn't have a soing
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00010.flac	a community instead of a fucking battlefield also there's no such thing as a fate cosplayer or a real cosplayer because there is no grand high arbiter of
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00011.flac	let people wear sexy costumes if they want to wear sexy costumes you can
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00013.flac	and were real people before you start tearing my friends down or me just stop and think what good am i putting out in the world by writing this nasty comment maybe this comment that i am writing is discouraging someone from getting into cosplay just think before you post please
id10153_VJ3EMTDuu-M_00014.flac	before the show aired if you have any experiences that you'd like to share or would like to ad something to the conversation please post in the comments below and i will be joining in i hope you guys enjoy heroes of cosplay uh and if you don't uh there's always
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00001.flac	since i was thirteen years old and i always played games since i was five and i somehow realized at some point when i went to a convention in new york i realized that you can actually make a living out of loving video games and so
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00002.flac	reviewing games is that i pretty much get paied to sit on my ass and play games and eat bad food well i don't get paid to
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00003.flac	think that i grew up in this sort of weird scifiy star wars world because my dad did the visual effects on starwars on on the original one but in truth i mean i just sort of found my
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00004.flac	i know that i'm a geek is it i i fly to conventions when they're not
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00005.flac	gaming when i was five years old um just because it was a whole other world and it was so beautiful like to go play video games or to play dungeons and dragons i mean i didn't play when i was five but as i got older i started playing
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00006.flac	dwarf and he got killed in battle which happens pretty rarely but it happens so
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00007.flac	down to the third uh chance to bring him back and essentially if somebody roles a a bad rolle
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00008.flac	over like a nineteen in order and i was i'm a roe
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00009.flac	twenty i rolled a natural twenty and saved my friend's life the chances of that were so miniscule and everybody cheered and got up and it was one of the most
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00010.flac	uh a roleplayer actually helps with acting as opposed to acting helping with role playing uh because you are so much more inclined you want to be this character it's a character you created from hand so it's a good way
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00011.flac	i hope to uh create my own tv show uh with all sorts of nerd culture with games who and all sorts of things for everyone
id10153_nxA7v53vvMQ_00012.flac	ideally i would love to collaborate with all these people in this cool nerd circle there's toug
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00001.flac	theu tub channel um i probably have picked up a couple new people uh since all these crazy videos came out deegos ar
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00002.flac	statement if you will i'd like to talk first about the major nalsn video
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00003.flac	out of my way trying to get this interview and when i first went up to the pr people at the michrasoff
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00004.flac	they were having none of it they're like readit oh don't wanna touch that and i beged them like oh we'll do an appointment next week
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00005.flac	mn they'll never do an appointment and finally uh i got an appointment i said only aske the soft ball questions nothing crazy which
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00006.flac	back the next day for my appointment and they said well we have major anouncement for you and i just was like what you what we do what so i was
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00007.flac	very very lucky and i was very grateful to get that interview with him uh now the pr person went over the list of questions that i had for him and she's like do you think we could skip this one and this one i said i'm sorry i gotto ask it i just have to ask it
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00008.flac	and so i did i did the interview uh i was sitting there major nelson was so wonderful so personable and friendly and uh there was a per person off to the side making sure i asked the right questions which it didn't really matter i asked all the questions that i had and she made sure that the interview didn't go south and you know what michresoft is covering their ass which
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00009.flac	pretty smart right now and it was nice enough that they granted me the interview but this is why
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00010.flac	didn't want to represent red it unfairly if my opinion was one thing and somebody elses
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00011.flac	maybe have some coffe or something i just really like to talk about the exbox one just all the
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00012.flac	parts and the bad parts the benefits the negatives why we can't get rid of dorm completely i mean obviously people arn't very happy and there's been very very
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00013.flac	things could be rectified you know things could be rectified well at least you know my
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00014.flac	centaring isn't real i was i didn't really want to make a meme and it ended up on the front page of our cringe which i had been following religiously and now i'm just sort of starting to realize it's just a place to try to bully people and the people who are doing the bulling are
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00015.flac	not so smart ones because they don't seem to understand that a lot of the stuff on our greng is actually ironic or
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00016.flac	funny to watch all the people not get the joke because it was just so full of hatred and vitrial and i was just like well i'm not taking it personally it's just weird to see all this anger and hatred bubbling up in people so much so that they have to comment you're fuking
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00017.flac	and super wonderful and lovely and it was obviously the people from arkrand that came in and tried to trol the shit out of me and i i wanna thank you guys for being so supportive um i plan to have a lot more cool stuff happening on this channel i promised i am upgrating from this stupid laptop camera within the next month or so and i'll actually have some kind of cool content for you well i'm working on it i'm working on it
id10153_z0e83AMnCiA_00018.flac	but i am obsessed i'm completely obsessed i can't play it alone cause i just scream and it's terrifying and i pause every twelve seconds so i'm getting through it slowly but i'm getting through it it's
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00001.flac	um i um now i think i always dreamed of being respected but um i i never i never had any um uh aspiration of of being famous or just being known
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00002.flac	of which exscapes me but um and i remember the credits came on and i remember asking my mom why it was over and i just
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00003.flac	first thing you think like as soon as the pilot airs the first time andsuddenly it's gonna be this huge thing and you won't be able to walk outside but it doesn't quite work that way it it's more of a gradual process but
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00004.flac	i was recognized or maybe it was um i mean it was the first time that i i drove up to paramount studios and and had a place for my car to go
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00005.flac	told no by the people andtheir environments by bullies at school that they can't be who they are or have
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00006.flac	i thik i maybe somewhere in my in my mind i i knew that when i made tha speech that that kurt was affecting more than just gay kids he was affecting a lot of kids that are jut being bulled in general so um i think maybe that's why i don't remember that moment at all i i was in such an adrilin high that i i i can't recall anything
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00007.flac	who's music i liked like everyone before her i really i didn't care for to much like um like growing
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00008.flac	well heres a thing what if something else comes along and they think no that gay kid from glee didn't give me a picture i'm
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00009.flac	positivity towards the situation and not negativity but um i i certainly hope so and i i i certainly have have witnessed first hand uh
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00010.flac	whenever i call my my dad is always over the  excited and just so proud and
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00011.flac	the security risks and and the um the security issues that u
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00012.flac	are very frightening that that people don't know that because i don't want them to know that um but uh
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00013.flac	want them to stop you want you want it to stop ut then the other hand you know that if you since you are in thepublic ey that if you f you are araging
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00014.flac	drk and and say get off  med leave me alone then you know it n e writen about the next day and uh and
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00015.flac	cause i think there's always the the question if like what people's real intentions are but um i don't know i think i think you just
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00016.flac	if i'm sobbing maybe like a minute to get things running down a minute or um if it's just like a if you need like one or two then itlike like a coule
id10154_T26GRTpBjUg_00017.flac	things that i'm up to um i'm doing a um i'mddeveloping a uh television show for disney right now um um

id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00004.flac	i cannot believe it took us this long season three to do we got the bet by the go gos i cannot believe cause it just
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00005.flac	it's really weird um seeing myself in an interviews
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00006.flac	whenever i'm uh you know playing curt from you know from six o'clock in the morning to nine 'clock at night every day i i noticed that like my own personal mannurisms tend to change a bit like escpcally when i'm an interviews like i'm much more high pitched in interviews i'm much more excited in in interviews and and then like over the summer when i shot the movie i was playing a different character who is very subdud and very rud and and and um and uh sarcastic and i noticed that that i was much more subdued in interviews and and my voise tite
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00007.flac	or in interviews an i a litle more serious so um i don't know i think maybe um i'mre
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00008.flac	if we change if we change the words a little bit like in stad of s and m it could be vocal a drennelin maybe
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00009.flac	bu i had to join fo col turnelin to do that no i would have todo it could be in your
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00010.flac	ssinn by reana or um sexy back from
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00011.flac	not tell you how many times i get stop in the street people think that i'm justing timbere like i cannot tell you
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00012.flac	that and justan bever can you believe that people always assume that i'm justin bever but
id10154_Ulf7-76t-D8_00013.flac	reasoning why i think that's why why it happens yes all the time but this is the reason why i think cause people see me on the street and they know they know me from
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00001.flac	accurs i mean this this is me talking normally of course i wanted to you know uh try to uh
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00002.flac	because i mean i think i think i did change i think i just went from up here to
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00003.flac	and um and wed ak it's my voice gonna change and they be like well you're um eighteen
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00004.flac	and i would you know i'd cry um but uh but no i mean i mean it's it's gotten me where i am now
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00005.flac	oh yeah oh yeah all all those things and i was like okay who who do i like bribe to get this but um but it was just i wa just such an
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00006.flac	it's amazing to be in a room where like you know that every single person was a leader of a country or or like i sat next to the man who um started the uh egiption
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00007.flac	on his computer and then i'm thinking of all the crazy stupid things like like myc
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00008.flac	i think so yes and i had a friend a we wre on set we were we were very bored so we um kindaf came up with like the concept for
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00009.flac	ng t and then suddenly i i hoped she said something about being  having a ful circle moment nd i'm like that's
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00010.flac	it was um i wont for the um corse one sinner um yeah and that was that was great again fore food
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00011.flac	um and uh and it it's actually it's funny because i was there a a year ago um uh like a a few eeks back and um i was there for the easter age role last year and uh we had quite the weekend that that that week for glee cause we were at opra first and then we went to the white house and opra has better security
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00012.flac	id at the white house because they never ance scamned me or put methough metal detector or
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00013.flac	shot the final in new york and it was insane cause the er they were they re cause the fans knew we were there and they're around us constantly um but um it was a very expensive episode
id10154_ddYbdJRPeQs_00014.flac	i knew i wouldn't remember any plans um that i would make anyway the next morning um but it's it's rally sad bcause i see bar right there and i
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00001.flac	morning is generally the kind of witching hour and uh everybody's a sleep and so i just go down and sit for maybe like three or four hours and
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00002.flac	aged an fleshed out and doesn't have a guita riff and we don't think anything's i don't think anything's finished right until everybody's put
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00003.flac	tthat if you i think the only thing an audience responds to is if they think you don't care so if you start out big or you start out tall or you start out whatever and that's your thing then that's great you know so but it's teit's if it's if you let it look like you don't give a shit anymore and you just spent the whole time partying
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00004.flac	it's because it's it's making something public that really wasn't designe to be you know it just it happens that those are our individual
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00005.flac	bel i just saying it's just what makes you feel comfortable and we and we don't really feel comfortable in that
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00006.flac	well it's just uh i think with any of our songs that have gone on to do okay i don't really know how they came through they just sort of it's the old clieca that everyone says poul sam all of the people all of the song writers say it's thike the good ones just kind of
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00007.flac	now that's a more of a consern because no body really buyes abums anymore but
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00008.flac	still ifstill we are in the business of making albums so we we need the sort of scope of that but you know thi song will never be like a hugely popular song but it just fits in the whole
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00009.flac	musicians and artists were were just working for patrans and maybe we're just going
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00010.flac	uh so well okay so if i think if people started to com into our shows and if if everybody wasn't paid at all it would be a
id10157_Ef6mujHmoyc_00011.flac	my da just came out came through i tellyoui exactly how it happened we were in wales and um
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00001.flac	and uh we always can't wait to do it again but whenever we finished au
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00002.flac	we love playing it i don't know i think it's the same as seeing your baby pictures or something it's very embarrassing when people
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00003.flac	you need that so we so we really listen intently to anything else that comes out and then we also listen to sargent peper and
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00004.flac	and now it's what we do it's like winning the presidency or something in my
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00005.flac	er we can be totally inspired and try and do the i no
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00006.flac	it can always be better some of this we were walking down on brontay beach
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00007.flac	and and uh one of them is like ah man i love yho music and then enother an was like
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00008.flac	it's funny because when someone insults you like to your face about you
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00009.flac	i had this woman the other day who was for some reason parked outside
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00010.flac	and i'm not proud of it but it's it's weird how you're if you sort of feel like you're being
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00011.flac	it's best to just let all that stuff go over your head but sometimes i'm not you kowyou
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00012.flac	says o that vilo you know i was doing this and we often get like sad boyfriend stories which is sad but you know
id10157_K7CQWJ1oK0g_00013.flac	point in the your point is i don't think it's any different playing to a hundred people to playing to twenty thousand in fact i find it easier to play to twenty thousand and to make it more intimate because i'm less intimidated by the one guy
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00001.flac	my dad always used to tell me that as a young child and as an older child an i fact  case a man as
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00002.flac	never give up and so uh yeah i i thought w'ld be a nice um thing to and the am and then after that very suddenly it also says believe in love it was quite a hippi sentiment to go out on but
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00003.flac	ye well one of them is um god thank for ask me about this man this su super col one of them is this poem called the guest house which was written by a old turkish poet who
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00004.flac	this guy from atthens georgea called coleman bark started translating these poems for a western audience and this poem is about how every feeling that we have as humans is ultimately a blessing even though it really doesn't seem it at the time sometimes and when i when i gosshown this poem about three or four years ago it really changed my life and way of looking at the world and so we put it in the middle f this album as a sort of thank you to that
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00005.flac	and then after that  we have a tiny clip of um the president singing
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00006.flac	tha that because of the historical significance of what he did i think and also tthat
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00007.flac	being about i was lost but now i'm found y that's how i fee
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00008.flac	started to make a record called goststories which we put out last year which e very kindaly interviwed me abut
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00009.flac	um the same time that the title of that came to mind the title a head for the dreams came to mind but i asked the rest of the band you know doyou think we could make this one first the smaller one i was in a sort of more intimate small place musically
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00010.flac	could we go right back in the studio and see how we're feeling and they said yeah so the title has been around for about three or four years but but we didn't start work on it until eighteen months ago
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00011.flac	listening to that pom that i'm telling you about and by just slowly seeing
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00012.flac	yeah if you wantna talk about that sure uh yeah we have w tried really hard because just because a romantic relationship ends doesn't mean that the other facets of your relationship have to end or indeed
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00013.flac	really i' i' i've done lots of work on it to just to realize how
id10157_dATog1S1tIw_00014.flac	that's how i that's really o i feel even on the days when i wak up and feel bit depressed or bit worried or whatever like well ike
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00001.flac	you know i was a huge fan of little miss sunshine so um and i was watching to see what their next film would be i've been waiting and waiting and waiting because they are so um
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00002.flac	uh and that quality is exciting to me to be they could 've directed so many things but to so to see what they wanted to work on next was right there very intriging and then when i read the
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00003.flac	um i was blown away i i know paull and zo from new york i met them on their first play um they did i was we have a mutual friend and i went to the show i i was blown away by their acting
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00004.flac	uh went out o dinner that night andwe started to develop a a
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00005.flac	so the opportunity to get to act with both of them was uh something that i was super excited about there comes o time though i guess when when as an actor when you go like oh i can be a part of this you know it's going to be special you read the script and you see who is involved and you go you you it's not i want to it's ike i  i i have to you know
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00006.flac	i've done that before um and it was also a good experience
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00007.flac	um the other one they were just good friends and and and that worked out i i've heard stories with two directors where there uh horor stories uh
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00008.flac	people kind of contradicting each other and you have one voice and then you have another voice and with john andval um they have a system i don't know what it is but it works
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00009.flac	it always felt like one voice um they are very specific and they know the film so well
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00010.flac	uh and they dig around in the script and with the characters so much that um ultimately you end up just trusting everything
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00011.flac	we ate together we listen to music and by the end of that process um
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00012.flac	your brothers you know you you have you have a love for each other you learn about paul you learne about his process and you learn about calvin
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00013.flac	you know i uh you know when i auditioned for this there was a lot of talk about we like him but he doesn't look like paull dano which i
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00014.flac	i went and i we somebody's idea was to to dye my hair lighter and my eybrows lighter and i did that and i still didn't look anything like balldanno but that thing their philosophy that way of rehearsal that theater company that they put
id10158_9w4Pg050urw_00015.flac	so rare to have it most of the time you're rehearsing to um so when you get on the set you're
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00001.flac	so excited that uh somebody was gonna take a a risk uh or chance on me an in doing it and then when it's been aflec doing it um
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00002.flac	you know you feel like you uh struck gold um they don't make films like this and um and uh
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00003.flac	i really love and uh and a big part of the reason i became an actor is because of the genra seeing godfather one and to uand watching those actors work is um a big part of why i wanted to be an actor so it was a no brainer for me that uh this
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00004.flac	and we uh we have a similar taste in films and uh ben's a cinphile so i can sit there forever and um uh kind of uh just chip away at his brain trying to figure out what movies he likes and why he likes that director and that scene or that actor and um so that's a lot of fun to do and and we became friends in that kind of we could bring that
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00005.flac	into this film and it kind of insue the characters with that so it was easy and fun those days where we were on set together uh
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00006.flac	i mean i've i honestly have never seen a car chase like that with these old cars in a movie before uh the they take days to do and it was very new for me but um uh he was great at guiding me along and um cause a lot of the times you're actually in the car and it's driving really fast and there's a a a a car in front of you with a crane that's following the car and it's very close or it's sometimes behind or sometimes it goes to the side and then sometimes you're on a process trail
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00007.flac	and it and it feels ridiculous feels like you're kind of um on some kind of roller coaster wriei
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00008.flac	and he would kind of insure me what how much how little what we needed for those pieces
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00009.flac	you know like when you play you know i don't know when i was a kid i you ko play like ji joke or iou know um
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00010.flac	i playe star wars and stuff and it felt it felt like that you just you looked at yourself in the mirror and you're like how  hell did i
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00011.flac	o like for him you know i would do craft service in the next movie whatever he needs i would i would be there in a second i'm uh indeted to him for his confidence in me
id10158_GFODBoFl3hE_00012.flac	um you know he's gottatons of options uh as an actor as a
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00001.flac	um i i was given the script and when i was given the script um
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00002.flac	i i got more excited an and alix the character of alix
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00003.flac	and i'vd been talking for so long about directing a movie um
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00004.flac	different ways of there are many different ways to make a movie or television show
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00005.flac	ting they wanna move the audience or make the audience laugh bring an audience on a on a ride but there's a lot of different ways of
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00006.flac	i think i had found rly on that i had a particular way that i liked to
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00007.flac	directors and actors and writers and producers out um and
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00008.flac	and and i always i tryd to be as honest as possible to the cast and the crew and saying i i wanna do
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00009.flac	you know you may not like it and that's okay you don't have to like it but if you do this film i want you to try to embrace it you know
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00010.flac	the camera for about twenty seven minutes which is what the card could hold
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00011.flac	but um but great for finding truth in
id10158_dv2VMH0YM10_00012.flac	see themselves and love ons in it um we we wanted to be as honest as we could so
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00001.flac	it's so funny cause it kinda throws you because it's the librarians it's basically indianna jones with a lot of magic my dear friend no wil started this ten years ago as amatter of fact tit airs u
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00002.flac	enough to be an actor to get to play some of the roles that you grew up as a kid just loving it's been it's been i'm
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00003.flac	the art and it's uh and it's something that i've always been been fond of so hjohn rogers who uh created the show and and and wrote this uh character with me in mine he he made this guy from oklahom and an art history major so that was
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00004.flac	thing that i can think of that are different is the  fact that we've got more technology now to make the monsters even betterth
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00005.flac	finally did such a good job if you've seen the films then you know that noa started off sort of a geek sort of nerd and he's now become this force to be recond with as indiana jones well we're starting out like that you know we've got to find our
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00006.flac	if it's something that's new i mean we had star treck we had all this sother stuff let me explain i mean  like i i love those shows ior my good ar good fried toney
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00007.flac	it's great to be to watch a crime drama to watch a who did it well let's put them on trial let's put them away we have so many of those men and some people i think that's why leverage that i was on for so long was such a big big hit because people wanna sit back on the couch they wanna let go o their day they wanna crack a bear they wanna disappear that's one of the reasons i'm an actor as i saw
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00008.flac	it's not being the thinking about work this is one of those shows it gets you out of the real world
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00009.flac	frst thing i just saw was so cool i wanteto go back into that world because i used to live there i
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00010.flac	buti was always getting beat up my friends were the movies i went to i went to the movies on the weeknd
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00011.flac	you know and  not to just go off tom cruise but then he did a cocktaile so i'mgonna be a bartender and then i saw another one itwas like ohi'm gonna be a fire fighter i'm i'm gonna be this i'm onna be that and then one day i just hit me i was around fourteen years old i said im i can just be an
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00012.flac	it's a it's a job but it's i haven't worked a day in my life in this business to be os we y it's a job you go to work and it's fun and it's what i wanna do and it's my job
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00013.flac	if you're in a colisee hm you know what i mean so it's like that's something that you know i can go out on the street and do alittl bit of acting and maybe get locked up but if i go out there and play a little music i might even
id10160_NFY4gpMivxw_00014.flac	uh dean develin was u i was fortunate enough dean develin is off doing geo storm right now with gerard butler big big movie in louisiana and he had the cameras left over from the librarians and i asked i said cad i borrow him for a couple days and he's such a nice guy and he's been a friend of mined for years he said take them so i whn about a week in a half we set up shop in portland oragon and shot the
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00001.flac	ea part of it um john rogers wrote it created and he kinda wrote this role for me actually
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00002.flac	bind e couch and my agent called an said man did you read the script lik go ats ot for me is o
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00003.flac	a lot of fun it was uh i i actually play play kind of a james bon type guy and uh and
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00004.flac	always great always great to have someone who is an ac
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00005.flac	he's the man behind leverage and ou snap to it you know when he's around very relaxed very relaxed uh atmosphere he's
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00006.flac	wasn't even written though we had the best i honestly feelik we have the best writers in town
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00007.flac	chary told me the story he said most of the crab that happened between will smith and
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00008.flac	not script i wile den it came up with that so dean as an actor that's so
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00009.flac	and that's where you grab something great i honestly believe that because everybody's
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00010.flac	the the amazing thethe actual the real cowboy and the amerian movie star tom say like is i can't say enough about
id10160_Um7wXsexmjM_00011.flac	uh which  very proud o i was i o  i got to play m cherricke so i gotto play

id10164_6eMViDDEk5c_00014.flac	definitely and through the show we've gotten opportunities to meet with a lot of
id10164_6eMViDDEk5c_00015.flac	slike like girls united so that's been really fun and and to hear their stories and to see if they relate or resonate with a certain storyline or character it's been really cool cause it's it's
id10164_6eMViDDEk5c_00016.flac	the writers have done a really good job of of bringing a lot of very
id10164_6eMViDDEk5c_00017.flac	and real stories to life um and and some of them you know we have not very like straied very far
id10164_6eMViDDEk5c_00018.flac	a lot of betrayl a lot of secrets a lot of lies a lot of

id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00002.flac	you know rehearsing everything which helped me become ansea pretty much and just working off and like feeling off of her with my lines and everything it was just a great experience all
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00003.flac	i think that anyone can relate to this because of the fact that you know they're both trying to still find themselves and u
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00004.flac	she just needs that love from her mother i just think any everyone needs that that bon
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00005.flac	she's so fun to work with and so fun to hang out with we were always like
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00006.flac	now she she helped me so much through like the entire process becoming uncad she she showed me so many things that like i
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00007.flac	i i never would have learned after this so i've learned so
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00008.flac	i could see it like after the rehearsals that i'd become a different person
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00009.flac	it that sometimes growing up means acting your age and i think that's so important because you know just because grace is has a daughter doesn't make her a mother exactly so
id10164_9RVdODLjcSw_00010.flac	being loved and being loved back you know loving someone and loving oegetting loved

id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00004.flac	met back up with my cast mates at the teem choice wards but only for a couple hours everyone has their own sceduls and are so busy but i'm really excited to be coming back in the fall just
id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00005.flac	oh she's very adventurous i'm i'm kind of a homebody i'm i'm not very dramatcwell i actually am dramatic but not as dramatic or sassy ii do applad

id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00007.flac	so i'm really excited for that uh music originally how i got into acting so
id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00008.flac	no um i'm korently kying trying to kind a find my sounds um i would
id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00009.flac	influenced as a young child with by edda james patsy
id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00010.flac	people like that so i i really love that soule aspect of music but i love everything you hear on the radio so i'm trying to fingd a nice
id10164_IAdaIBG_jVE_00011.flac	so pretty sulful i love amy winehouse love a del
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00001.flac	penny did physical comedy and they wrote toward her strength which was natural because that character was so
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00002.flac	and uh i kept saying to garry i do physical comedy too i go back to the ice cream social at receda methodist church uh
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00003.flac	so i i kept saying that to him and saying that and finally one day he said
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00004.flac	i'm gonna give you a chance and i'll see you know i'm gonna write you something and see how you do
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00005.flac	so i think the bit was she gets a vacume cleaner when we're cleaning
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00006.flac	get it off of her mouth and i think i put my foot on her chest and
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00007.flac	that and so then after that he said you're right you can do physical comedy and and then we started then it started becoming a show i guess this was the second season and we'd have the block scene where it would be at the end of the show something big would happen and it would be very physical we had
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00008.flac	physically fit i'll put it that way did penny and i wanna exercise look at me no neither one of us wanted to we just wanted to eat you know
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00009.flac	and some patato chips an a pepcy to wash it down and go to bed
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00010.flac	no we didn't no in fact the stuntmen's association made us honerary stuntmen and gave us buckles  where is that buckle  i gotta find it but uh no we didn't see why you know it's funnier if you put a stunt double
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00011.flac	the physicality is different the rithem is different so we didn't even think about that i mean we were grateful and the and the women that came on the show were wonderful but they just came background action and stood around and you know
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00012.flac	i'm not you know it goes along with my deslexia i can't i can tap dance a little she's a dancer i can move um
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00013.flac	roller skate and twirla baton penny can do it and i i i was just i would say yeah yeah yeah i'll do that i'll have that down by you know by the time we shoot uh yeah yeah
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00014.flac	i wouldn't and i'd crash into things or i'd fall or i'd you know i just there were certain things i couldn't do and and it dealt with like usually on roller skates i can't do a cartwheel either and we had to do cartwheels and one leg is crunched up her cartwheels great mine is just like a scrunched up cartwheel and then we once had to do like russhan dancing where you do squats and get on your feet oh
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00015.flac	that was tough i kinda did that the things i couldn't do i kind
id10167_0x6UxKMetG8_00016.flac	wasn't afraid to be humiliated because i knew it toud make people laugh and so therefore it's not a
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00001.flac	and ron and i ron howard and i went to meet him after we when we were set to do the film we had this quick meeting with him and he described the film as a musical to us he said because the music will never stop during the whole film except when the source of
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00002.flac	the the car has been stolen or there's a crash cause it's all takes place in one night with the radios going and you know and crusing and we thought wow what genius that is so but we felt we were making kind of this hot rod movie this low budget hot rod movie and uh and george was just one of us you know we were all um peers
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00003.flac	he we'd shoot at night from six at night to six in the morning cause it all takes place in one night but george would have to because it was so low budget he would have to go and edit during the day right behind us so he'd edit and then he'd come back to shoot so he this went on for about you know a week and soon you'd be shooting a scene and no one would yell
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00004.flac	and i remember one time ron and i had finished a scene and we just held and heled and waited and finally ron said george george and and he popped up he was on the truck you know the camera truck following us he popped up and he said what and he said cut
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00005.flac	and we said how was i and he goes terrific and if you ask anyone on that film that you know how did george direct and what did he you know what were his words to you it was one word
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00006.flac	and um so it was it was like going to a riscate church camp doing that movie it was there was a lot of mischieff because you had paull mat and and uh harrison richard drifuss and they were just you
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00007.flac	um six years younger than me and i was so afraid that that was gonna show on camera cause you know and so i
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00008.flac	i well there was no hair and makeup there were wigs and there was no wardrobe uh person we had a winnabago with everything in it there were no dressing rooms or anything he was just wonderful and you know of course i had watched him on maybery arfde and i knew him as opie and he
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00009.flac	he was just wonderful but we'd be sitting in the car during te set up while haskel wexler and you know george were setting things up
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00010.flac	he'd get out of the car and go and talk to haskel and ask him a question and you know and talk to george and then come back and sit in the car with me while we were waiting for the set up and i ask him what are you doing and he said i'm asking
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00011.flac	what he's doing and george you know and  i'm asking about the set up in the lighting because i'm going to direct one
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00012.flac	so um thhe was totally interested in the whole process of of the film
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00013.flac	and um and we would rehearse together he was one of the few actors that rehearsed with me you know i mean ever in my career well penny but you know on a film cause they don't usually have a rehearsal before
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00014.flac	in his acting and also in his observation of uthe whole process and i guess it
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00015.flac	took off and took everybody with it myself included so other than that i can't i can't answer that i mean i just all of a sudden there was this quasy fame this almost
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00016.flac	but it didn't take me into lavernad shrley it
id10167_7aoyaaDcsCw_00017.flac	and i was also nominated which people don't know but i was nominated for the british accademy award for
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00001.flac	it's very tough you know she's very she has a mind like a steel trap she doesn't forget
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00002.flac	i was just talking to her and she said didn't you read the emale i sent you and i said no you know i don't read emails i'm computer iliterate she gos don't you do anything i go text me text me
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00003.flac	um she she's a taskmystress she will have things uh she'll read the script and you know be smoking a cigarete and have it down in a day and i i'll hold the script right up to dress rehearsal and uh
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00004.flac	and she can be impatient but along with
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00005.flac	to be better and and try to be johnny on the spot and and it would be crisper because of her and uh
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00006.flac	yuit's just so difficult but the so then the attitude of the characters were real you know when she get upset with me it would be real and it just i just you know let it roll off my back after a while and didn't get upset by it but um
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00007.flac	as far as rhithem went as far as the door flying open and both of us being absolutely in
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00008.flac	i used to say to her if there were an olympic an olympic event for comedy i think we'd take the gold i used to say that to her cause wed just physically we just do thing
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00009.flac	the laugh some of the best laughs of my life were with that woman i mean and if we made each i go back to if we made each other laugh we knew we were would make the audience laugh also if it made us
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00010.flac	close like that i mean very you couldn't slip a playing card in between us like that but we had our differences but not when it came to hittin that stage and and doing you know what we love doing and it was like instinct with her like telepathy
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00011.flac	see our personalities are so alike in so many ways and so
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00012.flac	in so many ways and were both italian and loud and so some things
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00013.flac	we would play it out you know we could we could get loud
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00014.flac	i was upset about it you know and i maybe took the other side of it there would be squables but
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00015.flac	the entire thing was such a blessing and so much
id10167_rwhZnmjY6JY_00016.flac	and i have to say we are great friends she's one of my great great
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00001.flac	really great time working with garry the director um it's his first feature and uh there's always a risk involved when you work
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00002.flac	irectr 's never directed a feature before i'd seen his short film and really loved it and id liked him a lot when i met him and spoke to him about the movie and uh and about his vision for it but you never know until you start shooting quite how the thing will will
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00003.flac	is incredibly prepared always has a good perspective of you know
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00004.flac	the script just in terms of the way you're coming at the characters and the wy ou're coming at the story and his
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00005.flac	he's really impecable with his choice of shots of where to put a camera and he comes in very clear he's not one of those directors who comes in and tries to find his way through the scene he comes in with a very clear idea about how he wants to tell this bit of the
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00006.flac	uh and i've just goten uh you know i i find him you know a great collaborateor of
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00007.flac	hired as an assassin um his best friend and mentor has been captured and been told he will be
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00008.flac	exss guys who did an opperation that somebody wants them killed because of what tey
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00009.flac	i i might play a character who is exs es who begins to realize that are people are being targeted
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00010.flac	and i put together a group to try acounter what they're doing and do it so it's it's a spy movie that has lots of very good action in it but it is based in a very real
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00011.flac	real eightes world it's is kind of period film and it feels like a a spy movie
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00012.flac	a group called the fethermen which are a group of exss people with that weeld a lot of
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00013.flac	that are there really to protect the interests of ss people or exss people in their families and it's a very secret clandestan group that meet
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00014.flac	i basically play ther sort of guy on the street
id10171_IIf3S0DURE0_00015.flac	people who have had who have got strong attachments to the military i know im very much their guy on the street who's ar hearing the things and sort
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00001.flac	about um um jason plays a character who's basically hired as an assasson um his best friend and mentor has been captured and been told he will be killed
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00002.flac	pull a group together and and targe these exss guys who did an opperation that somebody wants them killed because of what they
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00003.flac	and i play a character who is exses who begins to realize that are people are being targeted and i put together a group to try acounter what they're doing and do it so it's it's a spy movie that has lots of very good action in it but it is based in a very real world
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00004.flac	a real eighties world it's his kind of period film and it feels like a a spi
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00005.flac	um certain people thave been around asking questions about certain opperations that the ss were involved in
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00006.flac	and he begins to sort of set up a counter intelligence amongxt s exss guys who u who are now trying to find out what's going on and try and prevent their guys being
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00007.flac	th i actually know if you csessaesguy so um i could pick their brains a bit and then um
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00008.flac	uh uh um a couple of meetings with uh uh ss consultand a guy has been in the sas for twenty five years and the interesting thing is he's
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00009.flac	playng and it was it was fascinating really just to pick his brains about
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00010.flac	the whole selection process for thess i had no idea what that was like and to hear how rigorous that is and how very few people pass that sort of test procedor and it's pretty much tha sort of people u uhare showing themselves to be incredibly adept and incredibly skilled and then sort of selected and put through this process where
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00011.flac	getget through so he he he taultd me all about that whole process and also
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00012.flac	he was a great sort of um explainer of what it's like to be exss in a way to be someone who there's something about this film
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00013.flac	covers i think that's the most interesting aspect for me playing this part and why i wanted to explore it is when a guy's been that sort of highly trained and highly skilled and been insie extraordinary intense
id10171_N0oCUbArfCk_00014.flac	it certainly helps if the team around you the stunteam a you know very experience nd very
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00001.flac	and one thing you realize about directors is if they're very smart everything else falls into place
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00002.flac	and everything falls into place everybody slots in everybody
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00003.flac	that's where it's allsort of eminating from and it's just about being smart as a human being
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00004.flac	et that the audience can empathie and sympathize with your allegieance is constantly switching
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00005.flac	t piece because it's all meet and every single scene is a very intense situation with fantastic dialoge so every time you come to a
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00006.flac	oh my god this is such an intense meeaty powerful scene
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00007.flac	that's why the piece is so exciting because if it works if it's pitched right and everything works  everything comes together well the cumulative effect of having nothing
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00008.flac	the meet of relationships one after the other
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00009.flac	and ther aren't that many you know we're in a we're in an ero where most movies are for teen agers or for kids and this is a genuine adot movie about what adduts go
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00010.flac	four weeks rehearsal for this and unusually and this is a very particular thing to my
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00011.flac	rehearse the scenes we didn't just talk about the scenes and rehearse them we spent a lot of time
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00012.flac	about the themes of the piece and talking about the characters collectively not not in a scene not saying wellhow does this work how does that work what's this beat about much more about the bigger themes of the piece
id10171_OuNwvNCJZxc_00013.flac	and the character traites how people how people behave under pressure how people behave when they're in love how people behave when they've been wronged how  and that was a collective thing that everybody sits around and talks which is obviously you know it's
id10174_HrlFSz_B2Ao_00001.flac	it was it was incredible because when it came down to it we all were
id10174_HrlFSz_B2Ao_00002.flac	down my cast members they all ended up uh doing likea little fun premiere while we were there and uh the weekend
id10174_HrlFSz_B2Ao_00003.flac	my you know my mom was an was just it was crazy id just got mobed and i had never experienced anything like that before so it really was a a a shock to all of us but i for me you know my my uh family has always been all about keeping normalcy so it was it was never rto

id10174_HrlFSz_B2Ao_00008.flac	the best part about it thre was there was nothing that we had to procure for ourselves it was all organic and real
id10174_HrlFSz_B2Ao_00009.flac	um well i i did go to a regular high shooli went to an arts high school um and where i was surrounded by normal students and and at the same time i was going off and shooting movies as well so like i said my family always sort af kept a a normalcty to our lives um if anything you know itdefinitely was

id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00002.flac	ms on this film also because you know we filmed up in in vancouver uh it was around the winter time
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00003.flac	the weather was very skits ofrenic and it would like por and then t would be hot and then it would would snow then itwould hal and you know especially when you're dealing with
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00004.flac	riding in the mud i mean they and they come off that track just a mess i mean a sometimes like it's
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00005.flac	actually yes um there was one inury uh that i i wasn't there to witness it but i i heard about it and it was actually
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00006.flac	rolling over the bike and you know the stuntowho did it
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00007.flac	and he did it and actually the shot that you see in the film that shot he broke his colar bone in that shot
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00008.flac	so i mean you know mean that's but these guys though the motercross guys that's what they do you know they they get up on that bike they take a fall they get
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00009.flac	to atan at the moment um if i if i'm not under
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00010.flac	i mean for for me i'm i'm hyou know as as far as being on set i always wannta give a good performance so i mean that's that's never anything that changes but
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00011.flac	i mean you know every once in while you have a have a a mom who's living vicariously through their child that is a a little bit
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00012.flac	love my i love my my mom fans absolutely no i'm i'm saying the ones who are you know if you're saying if they get a little cooke yeah sometimes
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00013.flac	fr you know free stye wild be out october ninth um there's also you know there's a few projects my production company was behind this film as well so there's a few projects that we uh through this through this company have have coming out through the
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00014.flac	take hold of of of the project in a lot f other ways you know i mean as far as even as far as casting a
id10174_UCWByECsQ0U_00015.flac	thu things you do differently next time and you know here and there so you know but over all i think we we we made a a reall good family film for this one you know we really just wanted to make something that was
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00001.flac	taking dance fasses when i was at very young age i started at to uh everything bale tapp uh
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00002.flac	to to go into whole bunch of other i mean other gonerers jas modern hiphop break dancing salso um
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00003.flac	uthat was the training when it when it was when i was on set uh we had a coach and i i
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00004.flac	had to work hard at it i mean ii i i'm not very good a basketpball so
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00005.flac	good enough to to play a character that's supposed to be incredible at it um
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00006.flac	it's interesting but stuff is always is oways always thrown at chad bringing him out of his element
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00007.flac	and during the first film that was it he he was a jock and he's comfortabl wi his basketball and then he kind of had to get used to the fact that troy
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00008.flac	was gonna be involved in theater so that was that was one thing he had to lett go uh the second movie was about him
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00009.flac	um him kind of letting go a little bit more he he he got into dancing and got into theater himself uh which very out of his element not his thing at all
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00010.flac	enjoy it but he does it because his friends do it and and he'll do it uh and this final movie is about uh
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00011.flac	wants to really consider singing as a career opption and and letting go of basketball um so for him he's losing his best friend and and and and letting go
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00012.flac	you mean the junkyard number so some so so cool i mean we've never zack and i haven't been able to do a duet together we've um of course been in production numbers as an ansmble together but we've never had the opportunity to do a number with just us to so
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00013.flac	mean we were in the the rehearsal studio together and just kind of really working on on the number and uh just really vibing off of each other and and we we we really grew together too as as friends which is really cool um
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00014.flac	yocou really you can really express yourself um you know that's why it's it's always so
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00015.flac	for for schools even to to host host uh art's programs and and and to be able to to let let kids explore themselves
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00016.flac	ma  no mno mater what it is i i i think the more you do the better i mean you youas as as
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00017.flac	it's never good to to just be stuck in one thing i mean i i for for me even though i'm not good at it when it comes to basketball and i'm not really not really um i don't really take to the sports as much um i'm happy that ie i've had to force myself to get into them from doing these films uh just
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00018.flac	to learn new things every single day and you gotta you gotta continue to round yourself and and in life i mean as as people ar our
id10174_lzlYfLeoWPI_00019.flac	make the most out of all you can throughout your entire life and and i mean there's so much out there to explore so much out tof  there
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00001.flac	um but it's it's extended over a period of time and
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00002.flac	uh there there ere there were    it was it was a time where we could we could
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00003.flac	um and not just not just think about her death but but really uh have time to let those memories of her
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00004.flac	about family and about the family in this movie that everybody can relate to is how you take on a role in your family
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00005.flac	no even if you are considered the most gragarious person in the world out in in the world if you have this incredibly gragarious
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00006.flac	uddenly you're the quiet one um and and that's a a a role that's often unique to
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00007.flac	everybody gets forced into these childhood role
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00008.flac	feels but it can also you know ie become very rageful
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00009.flac	support the family and um but of course i've held on to that that resentment and that's really
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00010.flac	um but i think i think my character get something from that too there's a certain you know self righteousness um and a sense of
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00011.flac	um you know  very you know very very family
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00012.flac	tone very early on that y he has this cast where there are people who 've done a million comedies and feel very confident
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00013.flac	communicability you know and when you go through the caster's more people like myself ha've never been in
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00014.flac	there was such a sense of safety and and generosity and and a sense that
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00015.flac	person for it and and i want to see your interpretation of it so that i i think we all felt
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00016.flac	i felt totally comfortable to take risks and if it wasn't funny it didn't have to be um
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00017.flac	we were that wasn't the intention hthe humor came from the reality of these family dynamics and and not uh not
id10175_1TRwtiGXedk_00018.flac	and and other people but there was such a sense of safety
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00001.flac	um but it's it's extended over a period of time and
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00002.flac	uh there there re there were  a t it was it was a time where we could we could
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00003.flac	um and not just not just think about her death but but really uh have time to let those memories of her
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00004.flac	about family and about the family in this movie that everybody can relate to is how
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00005.flac	you take on a role in your family you know even if you are considered the most gregarious person in the world out in in the world if you have
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00006.flac	suddenly you're the quiete one um and and that's a a a role that's often
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00007.flac	everybody gets forced into these childhood
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00008.flac	uh family i've stayed behind i've uh you know ran the the the family business and made incredible
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00009.flac	super ego of the entire uh family i've stayed behind i've uh
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00010.flac	help support the family and um but of course i've held on to that that resentment and that's really
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00011.flac	onto that that resentment and that's really sort of form this that's really become
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00012.flac	big house but not big enough for a crew of a hundred fifty people um so we were
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00013.flac	really set the tone very early on that he has this cast where there are
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00014.flac	andfeel very confident in their communicability you know and when you go through the caster's more people like myself ha've never been in
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00015.flac	of you know uh comedy before i mean i e an sort of but uh you know i i that's not my thing uh and and other people but
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00016.flac	there was such a sense of safety and and generosity
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00017.flac	and and the sense that you've been picked for this role because i think you're the best
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00018.flac	person for it and and i wanted to see your interpretation of it so that i i think we all felt i felt totally comfortable to take risks and if it wasn't funny it didn't have to be um it
id10175_U9Bm6qcL5mU_00019.flac	we were that wasn't the intention h the humor came from the reality of these family dynamics and and not
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00001.flac	uhpim found him a very young age the youngest ever graduateit
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00002.flac	and this incredible tecnology to be able to to shrink to uh half an inch tal
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00003.flac	and he was a he became nthralled with it and obsessed with it and wanted to persue it and hank had decided to leave all that behind and he realized what a pandora's box the technology was so he shut him out
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00004.flac	and and and hank is not the warmest father figure possible and um and really really broke
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00005.flac	he has this idea that he needs to be this salesman and this larger than life
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00006.flac	fgrum and so he goes at it but he just he keeps falling
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00007.flac	it's it's it's a really fun character to play because you have those that
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00008.flac	real and present um which is a really great thing for the cause my character is is very broad and and coming from a big place
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00009.flac	this is very broad and and coming from a big place and every time i have a scene with him
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00010.flac	at at pimteck and both have a similar
id10175_plVA1B7124E_00011.flac	very judgemental and difficult father and and they share that and they share that that resentment and that
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00001.flac	cause i've known it for like nine years and so it was it was it's just instantly friturnal you know when we get together we're gonna do this movie and we we had so much to draw on so it was
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00002.flac	thng and it's a super scripted and this was the opposite and he dustan called me and he said do you wanna do do you wanna play my brother in a film that carl besa is directing who is work i love and i was like yes i don't even thnk twice on the phone with him i'm like yes i'm doing this and it
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00003.flac	it's just it's it's freedom it's freedom man you know like you get to you get to explore i sat down with my acting coach andre andra machelroy and i said you know we we built all this backstory for these characters and all this like life you know we got to do all this cool stuff you don't get to do that a lot
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00004.flac	exciting for me was that i i i've never done anything like this you know and i'm always about the next thing the next job the next challenge you know tht it
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00005.flac	you know itwas incredibly gratifying to be able to you know reconnect with somebody that you
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00006.flac	i that i had no connection with you know for for so many years so it was it's one of thi i look at it as one of the best one of the best experiences that  that ave have come
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00007.flac	i mean it was amazing it was amazing that that that that was happening do you know it
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00008.flac	you know and and i don't wanna i don't i don't ever wanna look back in my life and and have a history of like shutting doors on people doyou know thim saying and and when someone comes to me you know you know rekindling a relationship it's it's
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00009.flac	you know i think when i figured out the evolution was figuring out that um parents are just people to you know parents are just people they make
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00010.flac	i've lived a leage of lives you know and um done so many things and  seene so many
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00011.flac	and i just i wanna do as much as i can i wanna push myself as far into as many characters as i can and do as many things as i can this is a challenge you know i mean that's what
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00012.flac	so huge and it' it just it requires so much of that focuss that i'm talking about that
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00013.flac	im i it never gets old it' there's always another challenge there's always another uthing to figure out
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00014.flac	i mean i'll i'll stay as long as they'll have me that's kindof my vision to it but i at the same time i don't write the scripts so i'm kindof curiousto
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00015.flac	people have always made a lot of assumptions you know you look you see this this uh young all american quarterback looking dude on the show and you just immediately make assumptions and i think people started really identifying me with those assumptions which is
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00016.flac	uhthe media and i understand that but at the same time i felt like i had to step in at some point and relate to people my experience and relate to
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00017.flac	if i can through my experience shed light on the way out of a difficult situation that i i know many kids are experiencing you know just like i did when i was a teenager i mean it's that's
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00018.flac	this whole fame thing is it just seems like so many opportunities i see it as so many opportunities and those there are many opportunities to do the next wrong thing
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00019.flac	finding a place you know it for me it wasn't so much about you know the substances persa it was more about about not fitting in it was not
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00020.flac	uh i i i hadn't found myself at all i had no idea who i was i had no idea where i was going i was trying to you know and all of a sudden i was like i'm gonna be i'm gonna be this bad kid and other kids are gonna be like oh he's the bad kid and so he's cool and so they'll wanna hang out with
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00021.flac	from watching people around me you know and it was just a lack of not really having a self image at the time as which is that's like typical
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00022.flac	like so what i'm trying to do now with this whole you know i had a hard time thing
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00023.flac	and my evolution out of that came a little later you know nineteen twenty yers o
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00024.flac	find something that inspires you find something that you can get excited about and that will become your newde
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00025.flac	and now i i see i i i'm actually super chritical i see all of my little mistakes
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00026.flac	being self aware you know or somewhat self aware of some degree you you really know when you did well and when you
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00027.flac	i took so much that from so much that was unsaid from from that experience that you know i i learned a lot it really made it a learning experience
id10176_02C9nSEG_gA_00028.flac	ied doin it since i was tiny and uh we we just came out of the studio we'r just recorded the drum parts and the guitar parts for three new songs so we're gonna be releaseng them like singles we're gonna we're gonna shoot music videos for each of them and release thm the

id10176_Bn-SNuseJiM_00011.flac	and who's gonna who's gonna be in the third season who's not nwho's gonna be around u it's gonna be interesting to see
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00001.flac	professionally i did nothing i mean i i i was gonna do a movie and it didn't work out unfortunately um but i then i was kindof like i got all this time off asome so i had three weeks off  iad i had four weeks off in total three weeks i went to vancouver and for a week i went to the carabean
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00002.flac	i was super excited to come back i didn't know what was gonna happen i didn't know if it was gonna be like crazy you know there was always rumors and all this drama and and then i came back to

id10176_IGiZia523_A_00004.flac	just like ih'd never left so it was it was lovely to get back and i i think all of us had enough time off cause we were working super hard before the break and we went away and and we all had enough time off to kind of recharge
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00005.flac	so that we could put them into our glee flashlight and shine it at the world o you like that
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00006.flac	you know there's that quality about fin thit's just it's really it's easy to miss it's youd miss you would miss that if if a relative was like that and then they they leght you would miss
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00007.flac	sofins like my my couson like my rellative that goes away for summer
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00008.flac	more kind of lineear way of writing it feels like it's all about cor characters rather than like you know in the second season we did a lot of you know uh ah tribute episodes things like that which were big and you know huge production numbers and stuff like that it feels like
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00009.flac	chelly corcer an storyline which th i think it's a really interesting storyline that didn't get
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00010.flac	so lots of new characters this season to but i think to expand the the centeral group it's it's not i don't think it's gonna be too devided it's
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00011.flac	venesalengies who's also from toronto uh a friend of mine for years is playing sugar mata and yeah we go way back i mean we had a bunch of friends it
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00012.flac	whenever you know somebody from canada and they come and they're on your show all of a sudden your friends is
id10176_IGiZia523_A_00013.flac	and uh he's coming on to our show as well to play uh masades new man
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00001.flac	crazy fifties fashions and half of it one block was attalian the other spanish
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00002.flac	cause the men of course looked dressiere than the women you know itwas like a punk book but i didn't realize it was punk then but i was very
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00003.flac	sailors and and and um and the guy that lived upstairs from me was um you know italian we were all italian families and um and the lady that took care
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00004.flac	husband was a sychic so i just the visual was pretty intense it was always like you know the wall of sants and everyone would come to him
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00005.flac	fok songs and and then when i left brookan
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00006.flac	different world and one foot in where everyone else was and so i thought uh
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00007.flac	is that alan gives a speech which is it written you know mack the nife uh gives a speech at the end about
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00008.flac	and so i wondered about that character and i realized that we
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00009.flac	on you know his wisdom didn't bring him too much fun you know her beauty didn't bring him too much fun and in the back of my head i'm thinking cause
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00010.flac	and and i am so proud to be part of um a play like that because
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00011.flac	this point in my life or at any point in my lie i didn't have a
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00012.flac	doing that on she said no and to actually be able to as an
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00013.flac	and then we were with we had many versions of blue angele and then but it was mostly john tory that i wanted to work with he had worked with a
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00014.flac	on girl who did very well her name was sandy and she was very well indowed and and she would stand you know proud and
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00015.flac	in the back of welioa say you know a we not signed no we
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00016.flac	s when we were first signed i had just died my hair i always remember from what hair color i had
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00017.flac	and it was so exciting and we were on our way
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00018.flac	and it was big and polidoas r and it was we were going we were going and the next year we were just gone we were not doing well we were at shit'svill
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00019.flac	and um i remember i just like spray painted my hair blue and i remember going on stage singing i'll have a ble christmas
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00020.flac	she's drunk and i'm thinking well not yet
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00021.flac	because they wanted me to be a copy of someone else and um and i didn't i remember they took me out to work with georgo maroda and he wanted me to do this song rodi and sound like debra harry
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00022.flac	an thinking and i hope that it becomes such a classic that you never forget and
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00023.flac	it was remarkable that it did become a hit song but it was
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00024.flac	i tell you it was a life lesson for me because that song constantly
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00025.flac	it was up for a gramy for best song it didn't win
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00026.flac	i do th people that i knew that i really liked i mean ii love sarmagoclon

id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00028.flac	once you have it separate then that's where you start controlling people and their minds and their braines and how they think because everything is controled
id10180_Vr3xG-5f9VI_00029.flac	i was so excited to be able to do that and i was able to mix the aranb from vivean green on the alternative of

id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00001.flac	the writing is so fantastic that there might be some some lines which you know get out there and like the line from the uh the pilot ou know what's the point of having fuck you money if you never say fock you and i think i think that when trended on twitter or wherever it was um so
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00002.flac	you know if they keep writing great lines like that there's every possibility that ther'll be these water coler moments but uh i think the way in which paul and myself will be sort of coming down the same track in opposing directions waiting for this this big colision
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00003.flac	just sort of trying to out manuver one another i hopefully te'llthrow up some interesting
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00004.flac	well i think i i i he i think he has a bit of survivor guilt and i think he it informs the way in which he wants to put back
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00005.flac	sets up this these scollarship funs which we see in the pilot um and i think he's sincere about that he takes all that very seriously i think the mystery is why boby was
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00006.flac	in the tower on the day um and i'm not sugjesting for a second that it's boby axr of the terrorist i don't think he was involved in that but i think he might have been involved
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00007.flac	the guys that i met only in that he is an elevated hightened character i think
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00008.flac	it's a little bit of a rock star i think as much as he says uh as shrewed as he is and as
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00009.flac	years which i found all of them to be i
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00010.flac	so i think he has to be careful about that and it might be that sense of ego in
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00011.flac	little bit of the show off that he'll have to watch e'l have to gard against
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00012.flac	people talk about the parenting scene quite a lot and it's interesting i cause no one has said whether they
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00013.flac	it's warm and affectionate and good parenting or whether
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00014.flac	a little overbaring competitive setting the two kids off against one another comyou know parenting in that
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00015.flac	i think the way i found the scene when i first saw it when i when we played it was that it was both but it was very
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00016.flac	parenting from a father who had grown up i think in symple
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00017.flac	was driving his kids driving his kids which i have seen a lot actually from growing up from parents that that kind of father who
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00018.flac	close to his sons and daughters but there's a sort of toughness there there's a you you you learn the facts i will grill you on them you will get them right because this will help you and it's all done with great affection great warmth a playfulness albeit that ends up in doing ten push ups if you get the answer wrong but it's uh there's a sort of it's their version
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00019.flac	of warmnth and playfulness but under underlying that a serious message that
id10182_Tj3-XSDsjzQ_00020.flac	which is a which is an innately competitive ambitious streake that just is in bobby
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00001.flac	i yeah i i think there are people who who do still think i'm american um and uh i he first american thing i did was um band of brothers and then um and i i still get peopleh
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00002.flac	foro five for this thing and then suddenly i was whisked off to l and i was stuck in front of tom hankson steven speealberg
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00003.flac	and they said steven would like to see you at nine o'clock so i had like four showers about sixteen cups of coffe and i went in slightly sort of shaking and u thought welt i've blown this but they they gave me the role and it was itthey're they're true true
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00004.flac	adi was in le at the time i invited him and he said i can't come he gave me a two dollar bill which is one of his
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00005.flac	advocacy you advocate for your character and you you believe in trust and uh love your character and can defend them whatever they are going to do even if it seems like they might be putting on a
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00006.flac	so the american marine who uh starts worshiping alla and turns to islam uh obviously is uh going to be in the context of a thriller a
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00007.flac	before i even accepted the job that i'd feel uneasy if there was any um a any lazy uh associations drawn between violence and islam and wouldn't it be more subversive if if actually islam
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00008.flac	i well yeas it iit it is a big hit and then it became an even biger hit when the uh president of the united states aid
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00009.flac	washexpecting to be sat next to the toilets and ended up being at his table
id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00010.flac	and uh found myself asking him and and mter cameran who was sitting next to him

id10182_Yp-fdQ7TgN0_00016.flac	i wi was in writing emales for the whole of the next week going i do hope he
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00001.flac	onsept where when you die you you don't know you're dead uh it's sorto like bruce willis in the six sente and your journey
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00002.flac	revelation that you have died and once you come to the revelation that you have died
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00003.flac	anit's this enormously challenging and frustrating and you guys  for those of you who watched lost we're on this journey with us as writers is what am i working towards
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00004.flac	you know lock was in a weelchair hurle was a lotterey winter um because these people chose not to
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00005.flac	in it up as as you went along how how much of the show as planed out um and they want the answer to to that question to be we weren't making it up as we went along we totally had a
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00006.flac	the plan was rock solid we had we had a a binder of
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00007.flac	except except it wasn't women it was a plan and uh
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00008.flac	and this was this was this was our intensive mithology and that's what we're
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00009.flac	from its inception you know very early on for the reasons that i talked about before that we knew we were gonna run out of
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00010.flac	it's a mystery based show and so if you have a mystery ba show and it's an episode of
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00011.flac	contained and you move on but for lost it was serialized so we we knew that these mysteries needed to have soulutions um so we actively started lobbying for an end date of the show thright at the same time that we got our end date within th within the space of about three weeks the
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00012.flac	soprono's ending we started hearing all this negativity surrounding the sopprano's ending from the fan base which is like
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00013.flac	what does it mean did tony get shot at cettera is like you asking those questions defeats the entire purpose of the way that david chase chose to end it
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00014.flac	henwe came to the secondary revelation which was there was no ending that we could possibly come up with that was not gonna be highly divisive and once we embraced that idea
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00015.flac	and in our fan community you were sort of either a star wars guy or a star trek guy or i'm saying guy and i mean guys and girls but you know you kinda had to pick one but what we what we started to find was that there were a lot of people who defin them
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00016.flac	an an anticipation of this happening and  even my rps didn't know
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00017.flac	let let that be this and sure enough uh the script that i read was by this guy john spats who i i shared a credit with on prometheus
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00018.flac	at the center of it which was where do i come from uh who made me
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00019.flac	explore these ideas of um of who made me and why and more importantly what would we say to them
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00020.flac	i was terrified and remain terrified of him to this day
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00021.flac	um it it can be very ambiguous uh but i choose to look at it as i just want to write up to my audience and i feel like i'm not interested in spelling things out for them i want to leave avenues of imagination that are available to them but i don't want to say
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00022.flac	things out for them i want to leave avenues of imagination that are available to them but i don't want to say that
id10183_SPJXLhtgrrg_00023.flac	there is um in the story telling that i do a defined um you know uh
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00001.flac	here from the viwers at home uh and then obviously we're ina field questions here alive uh at the mc
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00002.flac	uh via twitter he asks how does the greek mith of prometheus ti into the story uh beyond just giving the ship its
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00003.flac	the the mith of prometheus is uh prometheus was a titan in greek mithology uh and uh
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00004.flac	mankind mankind was sort of uh wandering around on the earth very cold and uable to
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00005.flac	food so prometheus stol fire from the gods gave it to man and as we all know man has done all sorts of wonderful things with fire but all sorts of nasty things as well the gods got angry at prometheus they tied him to a rock uh and and so every day his liver gets pecked out by an
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00006.flac	until it's uh bit completely gon then it regenerates and then an other egle comes repeates the process and we said hey who
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00007.flac	this this one's from uh jim mojelesky sorry if i miss pronounced your name jim also on facebook uh we saw guy pierce appearing as peter wayland in the ted piece do the ideas he presents in that piece
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00008.flac	last summer uh where you said that with prometheus you wanted to scare the s star star t out of
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00009.flac	i think we all know what she's talking about guys right uh is this the scariest movie you've ever made and uh and and what makes it so
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00010.flac	how did i transition from an alien prequel into what you've called an original mythology
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00011.flac	uh gentleman named john spates uh wrote a uh wrote a script that i thought was great and ridly uh said was great and sent sent to me
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00012.flac	and uh h but rily said i really want to uh make an original movie i feel like i already made
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00013.flac	um and uh and i'm very happy with the way that turned out there's no reason for me to just go back and do that again uh there's some great ideas in this script uh is there a way that we can take these ideas and move forwards
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00014.flac	uh at the same time giving a tip of the cap to the people who have seen alien we don't wanna deny it this is a part of that but it has to be a movie unto itself
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00015.flac	i just sort of looked at you with stars in my eyes and said whatever he ou want me to
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00016.flac	
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00017.flac	thim
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00018.flac	like uh you guys are the ones who waited in line ind the raine to come and talk to us so uh uh we love to hear some questions from
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00019.flac	so please feel free to um uh approach the mices and
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00020.flac	where the interview were i has a question presupposing that we will just answer s i you haden't taken a massive
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00021.flac	the life that you have seen in different movies perhaps that's additive uh perhaps it's going in it's own new way perhaps it's both but hopefully you will get the sort of uh
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00022.flac	that you are having and what's really interesting uh to us when we started talking about the future is say a hundred years from now ore in in this case in in twenty eighty five uh are people still gonna be having the same
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00023.flac	or will science have gone to a place where those the that conversation is radically changed and what are the religious and spiritual implications of that so what we're willing to say is
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00024.flac	your question is dealt with and talked about with great significance in the movie but we don't wanna tell you what the answer to it is um or whether or not the characters are still asking it at the
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00025.flac	any cientific discovery that could be made in my lifetime that would make me stop believing in
id10183_VTwVoIapW-Y_00026.flac	and you know if we did our jobs right hopefully you'll be asking yourself is there any cientific discovery that could be made in my lifetime that would make me stop believing in god uh it's a very provocative question and we certainly don't have the answer to it but the movie is certainly
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00001.flac	we had a miniturization uh bit a machine that um that basically shrunk things to infintestimal size uh they're
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00002.flac	you know uh ah tomorrowland um uh a a ride where the audience basically got
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00003.flac	and our idea always and and theree some there's a great book called before tamorrow land that jeff jenson who worked on the story with brad and i wrote that talks a little bit more
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00004.flac	actually a cover for the real place so yes walt was was most
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00005.flac	i i can't wit i'm uh because j j and i are close um everyone has the
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00006.flac	or know things about the movie that they don't and the and the god's honest truth is i don't wanna know anything um so when i saw that trailer i experienced it in the same way and at the same time as everyone else did and it
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00007.flac	who who is that cromne storm truoper and like i don't know anything and it's imensely
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00008.flac	ouh of course i uh right now i'm working on the second season of the uh of this tv show that i've beenworking on called the left overs i don't have any i don't have any movies in the pype line because
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00009.flac	um these two jobs has has been um immensely time consuming but um obviously the uhyou know star wars really made me wanna be a filmmaker so the the uh the the possibility that i could work on one of those films in the future would be ah
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00010.flac	i plane and i crie you know it got me i'm not gonna you know i'm i'm a softy when it comes to that kind o stuff i thought it
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00011.flac	unfortunately after after treck two uh i went to go work on tomorrow land and uh and the left overs and so and then j j went to go do star wars so um star
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00012.flac	its own propulsion and i actually kind of feel like um uh that those movies are best served by some level of of constant reinvention i was very excited to learn that simon um who is a a huge fan himself was gonna start uh working on the writing of the uh of the third film and i can't wait to see what he cooks up because i i feel
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00013.flac	ui i i honestly again i don't know i much about it other than that this this star trek film is really about the beginning of the of the five year mission so um it's it's establishing
id10183_cxyfeYEVMrY_00014.flac	you know i i do feel like um that perhaps uh alalthough i really love ina darkness and and working on it um the idea of bringing star drek back into that kind of opptimistic more fun adventure space um as opposed to needing to necessarily make it dark and broody um i i would like to see um a little bit more of that original um series kind of colorful energy uh back
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00001.flac	and one can only think about the star war system and the fact that there we had u sattlihe mounted canon well they'd be good for shooting down rock
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00002.flac	but uh you know biological way like we disect frogs um maybe
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00003.flac	benevolent species coming to this planet and taking a man and a woman and taking ova out of a woman and
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00004.flac	for to speak for mankind to these beings that were were coming
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00005.flac	thke caseas shermer ba benny and uh barney and betnty hill the pascagola incident um uh travis walton
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00006.flac	from the space i would have to say look you know what we see up there and what we find you know
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00007.flac	well i wouldn't wanna go back in time and change anything because uh that would be
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00008.flac	a tampering that i i i wouldn't serve mankind well although there ware many horrors of course wouldn't you have loved tohave
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00009.flac	os problem and then well war two may not have well look there were two guys there was auto dinkle you never heard of him well he was an rato
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00010.flac	it maybe auto dinkle would'ave been the guy that would have gone on with this rabit anty sematism and wiped out nine million people
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00011.flac	hins but you don't want to go back in time and play with
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00012.flac	today and the improvements we've made uh in in in uh in human rights and in regarding ourselves uh as sacred they've come because of the bad
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00013.flac	i'd love to sit with the you know the partiulike uh you know the quantam physics guys because there really is is the rouot of
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00014.flac	and the the the just the the the joy of these studies and
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00015.flac	what i said and what you said and what we we all did two minutes ago still exist
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00016.flac	uh that uh you know there there maybe beings out there who
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00017.flac	uh vessel or is there' some cost that that you pay
id10185_oVCd50LXPGY_00018.flac	imenwe know people have been taken we know there's experimentation going on we know people have been told about a genda's what we now have to do is use that

id10185_ybo-knxs1Sc_00010.flac	i i went to ah uh an annelist uh when i was a kid and uh i hade a little touch of that a litle touch of turets was
id10185_ybo-knxs1Sc_00011.flac	some of the uh uh just uh maybe just getting absorbed in kind of a a look a face a voice when i was a kid you know in the mirror like jim carry talks abut
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00001.flac	i grow up with in a public school with arts programs you know kindaf like that show gle
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00002.flac	so that uh arts is not the desert it's part of the main
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00003.flac	but we have a very inventive charmon of the nn rocko landa sin
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00004.flac	uh well it's it's it's set in the seventies it's directed by brooks branch and you know i grew up in the seventies and i love those movies like paullmazersky movies where it's got drama comediy it's just like life like unmarried woman so that's why i wanna do it's
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00005.flac	you take it very personally that's really kind of devastating but i'm at the point my career is like  what what's next i don't take anything for
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00006.flac	well okay several things i don't like to repeat
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00007.flac	so sometimes it's a role that i've already done so i don't wanna play that
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00008.flac	thing that i don't wanna do that but mostly yyou know you do the best you can at the time and hopefully it all works out in the end
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00009.flac	i ded an you go what did i do definitely i'm i'm human but like desperate housewies for instance i turne that down originally which everybody knows
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00010.flac	kept keeping it alive which they should not have done that they were
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00011.flac	i i turned it down because i had just done a show called pasadena that mike white wrote that i loved i thought it was great
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00012.flac	and then i was lucky that three years into the show he called me up and he said are you ready to come on now and that's really unusual in hollywood most times when you turn someone down here they say screw you i'm never working wih
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00013.flac	s that you need to really communicate why you're doing it i didn't know that early on and um i i really have had  directors come up to me and say
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00014.flac	tit's a bonus of not being the show originally the the four leads are so iconic now that i think mark te is very careful not to mess with that you know who they are as characters where as i'm the wild
id10188_4N4lCaudYhs_00015.flac	you know killing my husband the first season nd being a battered wife to then being  becoming a staker and and then i ended up
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00001.flac	invm that i was portraying and it was the first time that i saw
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00002.flac	ihave to move to new york and they don't pay very much money it's on agebo and i said
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00003.flac	other roles i've turned down that i've stoped talking about cause people constantly ask
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00004.flac	um so my dream was that she would come back from paris with a phoney french accent and being really
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00005.flac	unfortunately that's not how mark chery wanted to end the show and it's his show and he gets to do what he wants i just was
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00006.flac	me because when i was growing up she was the epitemy of the working woman um in fact when i was younger she had her own
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00007.flac	called loes lane and she had her own comic and that was one of my favorites and
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00008.flac	the longest running glowa lane voice other people have comein
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00009.flac	nathan and i have worked together three times um he was my priest slashe lover in a show i did called pasadena
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00010.flac	and then he was my husband on housewives and then i he asked me to come on castel as a favorite
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00011.flac	it's a game where you have to guess who's a town's person
id10188_aI3eCrBBIb8_00012.flac	mad is played by joanna casity who i adore as a person and joina and i have talked about
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00001.flac	six i was supposed to be marrying mike that's what i thought was gonna happen and then mark called me mark cherry who created the show called me a week before we started shooting and said i should
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00002.flac	i was had thi storyline with julie bens you know where she was my lesbey and girlfriend
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00003.flac	she needs to stop trying to find happiness outside herself that the happiness is inside
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00004.flac	idon't wanna get in the way of you having your own show that would be terrible so if it doesn't work out you can come back so in one day he wrote uh robin and cathrin go to
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00005.flac	and it happened so quickly that i didn't have time to digest it and i was crying in the makeup trailer and everybody was weeping because it was like
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00006.flac	and i said uh what i'm becoming a man and they said close and that was bit and i was so excited i actually was in the parking lot and i started jumping up and down screaming because
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00007.flac	we've there's been so many wild things to happen on wisteria lame but none of the housewifes got to be lesbian so i got to
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00008.flac	and i think that it made mark a little bit nervous that i was having my own storyline cause my job was to cause trouble for the other housewives so he didn't want it to go on too long it was more about how they would react to having one of their
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00009.flac	i and um we actually had worked together years before and
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00010.flac	of their actors becaus there's so many different outlets so i think when they see an actors working they wanna
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00011.flac	no it might yeah no if body f prof doesn't work out mark said that i when when that got picked up um he sent me a big bokay of flowers with a notes saying i'll be waiting
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00012.flac	it's more like house where you know my character's kind of smarter than everyone else and erganand
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00013.flac	and then each week i play a medical examiner and each week uh we'll sove the crime of how the body
id10188_v8M4yVx0m_0_00014.flac	really good cast uh we have two cops uh nick biship is an australia

id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00002.flac	and uh cragon gives us a couple days off and we all go our separate
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00003.flac	a difficult situation in that we all have those two days off and don't expect to hear from one another so to everybody in the squad it's just normal that we wouldn't hear even partners wouldn't even necessarily call each other
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00004.flac	most raw episodes i've read um hard to read i'm sure it'll be hard to watch
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00005.flac	um but it's also a story of survival it's a
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00006.flac	mostly for liv but for the team try and hunt hunt her down
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00007.flac	alivias situation is about as dir as any situation can be knowing what we know about leis and what he's capable of and what his mois
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00008.flac	you know the svu team we all know that lewis is responsible for multiple rapes uh for at least one murder uh for uh being responsible for the death of an older woman uh
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00009.flac	and his hostage that only you know makes that situation more difficult more
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00010.flac	i don't think i've ever read a script faster you know what is gonna happen you just fliping the pages to
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00011.flac	uh has been uh granted leave from the squad
id10199_GO1iSiqXgO8_00012.flac	she comes back in the middle of an investigation that deals with multiple
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00001.flac	uh and people take shots at munch and then of course munch takes his shots at everyone else uh
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00002.flac	uh waren light and julie martin the the writers uh were channeling richard belzer when they wrote it you know uh but everybody takes their shot uh but it's it's all it's a bitter sweet
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00003.flac	uh so he is not retiring as a police officer but he is retiring from
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00004.flac	uh and we'll get to work together again but you know i have a lot of fond memories of working with belzer obviously i
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00005.flac	shed light on what it would be like to be a anesviw
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00006.flac	iti'll be interesting without munch there to see whether amarro gets a little rud
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00007.flac	but you know personally ii'm i'm a big richard belzer fan he's a very funny man he's uh genuine he's heartfelt he's thoughtful uh you know he's a comedian he's
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00008.flac	in this episode you have uh the munch storyline which
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00009.flac	very personal to all of us uh and then you have the the crime and the crime centers around
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00010.flac	sometimes remote locations uh od locations uh and it's it's difficult to get an invite everything is cash based so it's hard to trace who was at the party uh and because of that it's it's difficult to find who our
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00011.flac	cause uh live gets a text from uh a
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00012.flac	uh who is who has moved on and now clames to have been uh assaulted again and so that's that's how the investigation begins and we start
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00013.flac	uh waren light and julie martin the the writers uh were channeling richard belzer when they wrote it you know uh but everybody takes their shot uh but it's it's all it's a
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00014.flac	munch is being he's he's uh retiring from esvu
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00015.flac	the uh d's office to the d's office to be a an investigator for the
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00016.flac	uh so he is not retiring as a police officer but he is retiring from svu
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00017.flac	so hopefully that has potential to bring him back within the circle uh and we'll get to work together again but you know i have a lot of fond memories of working with belzer obviously i'd i' only joine the show uh
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00018.flac	relative time that's a short amount of time when o you think about the show being on for fifteen seasons uh
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00019.flac	and yet i still have very good memories of of working withim uh
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00020.flac	shed light on what it would be like to be a anesviw
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00021.flac	iti'll be interesting without munch there to see whether amarro gets a little
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00022.flac	but you know personally i i'm i'm a big richard belzer fan he's a very funny man he's uh genuine he's heartfelt he's thoughtful uh
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00023.flac	in this episode you have uh the munch storyline
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00024.flac	very personal to all of us uh and then you have the the crime and the crime centers around
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00025.flac	sometimes remote locations uh od locations uh and it's it's difficult to get an invite everything is cash based so it's hard to trace who was at the party uh and because of that it's it's difficult to find who our
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00026.flac	but it does carry a weight to it because of of what is curently happening within the squad room with much is the
id10199_eErQo6iViGU_00027.flac	not necessarily study but toit it's an interesting presentation as to how cops can have different instincts can have different perception of of a victim or of a crime and how they investigate that crime
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00001.flac	it centers around an investigation uh of a serial rapist murder and uh it takes us down to mimi to extradie him back to new york and being from miami uh i was excited to read that in the script uh less excited to have uh shot in the bron
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00002.flac	so we we go down there and uh on our way down we meet uh the character played by marcia gay hardein who is uh an fb agent who beat us to the punch essentially and is there uh on the federal level to uh
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00003.flac	for this for this one person and then uh at that point we come back to new york and we realize that it's not as uh straight a shot as we thought the case would be it gets more complicated uh it gets more personal it gets more
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00004.flac	lewis uh played by marcia gay harden they have a personal
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00005.flac	there's a conflict there uh so amaro plays the cattle
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00006.flac	it's a twenty five year old uh essentially cold case uh there are uh four victims uh raped and murdered and a fif
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00007.flac	uh that is questionable to in new york which which uh brings it under our umbrella at svu and so we take ownership of the case because we have positive uh dn on one of the cases and we're trying to uh
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00008.flac	uha statis uh where she's the fed and we're the loly an wypt svu
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00009.flac	relationship with liv with benson amarro i think sometimes uh throughout the course of the episode feels like he doesn't want to disturb that and so he treads lightly
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00010.flac	this is my first time working with marsha i mean marsha and i have so much in commen she's uh we both went to in whieu grd graduate chool uh she has an academy
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00011.flac	she's a fantastic actor i mean that you can't really say enough about marca gay harden i mean she comes to
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00012.flac	you know that started in july and here we are you know approaching febuary
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00013.flac	uh helps us because you know we're we're in the trenches for for months on end uh telling story after story and so to keep it fresh to have that walk in
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00014.flac	i think opens things up a lot so i yeah i was excited that she was gonna be a part of it just because of her name but to get to know her and to
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00015.flac	jake carnes and i we i think we have the the natural tryfecta uh because we workd together he actually interrogated me on the shield right i wast on the other side of the table and then on cold case i interrogated
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00016.flac	cause i get to interrogate him again so that's three shows that we've uh worked on
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00017.flac	he's a fantastic guy from the first moment i met him on the shield
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00018.flac	you know that was that was his playground you know he had been on the the show for a season and i was coming in as a guest star uh with a
id10199_xz2mrPFJGiM_00019.flac	close relationship with liv with benson amarro i think sometimes uh throughout the course of the episode feels like he doesn't want to disturb
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00001.flac	things are absolutely exolent it's always a good time when you're in torono i don't know what it is it's like my fourth time in the city it's beautiful it's always nice people
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00002.flac	i think for anybody um that has kind of had their sights on uh whatever gol forever for for however long uh
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00003.flac	you know i think it's cool that that's even part of adialoge you know something that is so culturally relevent that can reach a guy like len beck i
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00004.flac	like let's piss off glens backi mean that's just gonna happen like you know whether yoc wants o or not so um i don't know
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00005.flac	is that they're trying to sort of normalize things and this isn't necessarily exclusive to
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00006.flac	uh equal rights this is about you know uh freedom
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00007.flac	um but uh uh we were saying oh w yeah so i think you know g kind of uh seeks to normalize things so it becomes less about a policy and more about a concept that just becomes um sort of matter of fact i think my favorite thing about the relationship that i get to have on the show uh is blained with with kurt is
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00008.flac	to have gravitated towards their relationship not so much because it is a young gay relationship so much as because it is a eay
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00009.flac	huge fan of criston i'e told her this almost every day on set um i mean it's hard not to be a fan of hers i mean it's tough to be a funny woman i mean comedy is a man's game you know and especially in the entertainment world it's it's tough
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00010.flac	ijust nocke it out of the park with everything she's funny she's she's pretty she's just fun and just uhmagnetic in every kind of way which is why the comedy works because you care about her so um yeah it's a real treat you get to iget to work with
id10200_1N4FDDkvgK8_00011.flac	o no how i got that a'm sorry to to  yeare this o uh pink was scedal to sing for this and she uh unfortunately
id10200_eamyOSArols_00001.flac	yeah and it's it's not a a necesarily broadway songs but just peoplethat have a lot of broadway ties cause there's a lot of um i'm sure a lot of people are singing you know pop songs
id10200_eamyOSArols_00002.flac	necessarily like all show tunes but yeah in that sense it is sort of like outdoor worp tor kind of vib i mean we're not gonna be mashpitting i mean
id10200_eamyOSArols_00003.flac	festivals and concerts and stuff and uh it just seemed like an interesting thing to try out because i you know i go to lot of festivals and i go to a lot of
id10200_eamyOSArols_00004.flac	it could crash and burn forll i know i mean idon't wanna i don't wanna like jinks it but you know i'm it's
id10200_eamyOSArols_00005.flac	uh like plays and stuff and i was a big music fan and i  like a lot of
id10200_eamyOSArols_00006.flac	back ond and i go wh was pretty cool for you know like i eight year old but i i just i bought a lot of records i bought a lot of tpes and i just i was  just an avid rampant music consumer so i never really put the two
id10200_eamyOSArols_00007.flac	theter as a child because like just like i played basketball as a child but i'm notm not the mb like it was it was
id10200_eamyOSArols_00008.flac	blike w very intimidating and uh that was not us we were the kids in the corner like reading chekovin smoking
id10200_eamyOSArols_00009.flac	and so uh yeah i think my scenir year of college we um for fun and if yo you know  i think this happens a lot in colleges and universities put on people put on these shows just for
id10200_eamyOSArols_00010.flac	the other one doesn't sound as good with poops but for poopes and giggles and um you know i had music in it that i would write and because i wrote the songs i would sing them to so that was this thing called a very potter
id10200_eamyOSArols_00011.flac	yeah i think for the for for people to associate me with musical theater cause it's uhit's the thing that i say is um like i i love food i've always loved food in restaurants but i never wanted to be like a chef so it's this kinda weird thing
id10200_eamyOSArols_00012.flac	listen if you're gonna like subject yourself to a life of being and i'm using quote fingers an artist uh in a badman voice an artist
id10200_eamyOSArols_00013.flac	a huge amount of uncertainty so for me i'm just a mercinary it was like if i could do music cool if i could be an actor cool if i'm like gonna you know talk on the there's so many things that if itinvolved being creative cool
id10200_eamyOSArols_00014.flac	i was years old and uh i remember realizing so i group in san francisco and robin williams was a big and has been for for obviously for many people many generations a big figure in the entertainment community and because his kids lived you know he raised his family in sant
id10200_eamyOSArols_00015.flac	you know when you're myears old you don't really have a
id10200_eamyOSArols_00016.flac	have any other ideas and then i remember seeing aladin and then loving the
id10200_eamyOSArols_00017.flac	that's cool like how ever and i just remember like the audience thinking like laughing and butwithout ever comprehending and i thought it was so cool that all these strangers could come together and like get
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00001.flac	and uh aside aside from the fact that it's it's such a great show and aand a hit show at that um i think the most exciting part about it is the the role itself you know i mean that's just a bonus that it's actually a
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00002.flac	an interesting role for an actor's dream you know so um and and uh
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00003.flac	my exact response i mean i was i was laughing basically because i'm i'm so busy with so many
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00004.flac	um when my manager and my agent called me to tell me about this i thought they are sortof just messing with me because we have that kind of relationship where they would say something like this to mess with my
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00005.flac	anything up because it's been a a dream com tree and it's um  i i i can't
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00006.flac	i won't even hit me i don't think it's ever really gonna hit me i hope it never does cause then i i'll
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00007.flac	this before in other roles and an other capacities but this is the first one whe're it was a part that
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00008.flac	positive energy for any kind of youth dealing with any kind of um issue so yes i i really
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00009.flac	ha friend and a mentr to kurt and and for the first time having somebody of
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00010.flac	in the exact same situation is curtto this at this point in the show most of court
id10200_vgEmA6im1wk_00011.flac	relatable as as blaine will be so  that's the coolest part and uh we'll see what happens from there but uh
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00001.flac	and it was introduced on a new tecnical standard o six two five lines as against four
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00002.flac	um and one of the ideas i had uh was that we should put together all the loveliest things
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00003.flac	western civilization it created nsince the last two thousand years um and and show them in collar a ravishing ad a ravishing
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00004.flac	was a huge success uh beyond anybodysi
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00005.flac	said implicitly to viewes now look here you are we're gonna take thi seriously we're gonna start at the
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00006.flac	um well it was a huge success as i said so much so that the head of science or rather head o of of
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00007.flac	uh uquite soon after civilization had started saying this is an absolute scandel i was supposed to be he said youre supposed to be
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00008.flac	though science to start with was not at all as obvious a subject as civilization ould ben i mean for a
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00009.flac	that it um it didn't deal with with material objects in that sort of sense it dealt with thery and there were great slabs of thery how are you gonna put those across i mean that not an obvious
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00010.flac	idn' know it at the time in britain he also had an uh uh an established
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00011.flac	in british dramas period dramas costume dramas um and uhhe's a marvelous broadcaster
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00012.flac	we're bringing the americans which we were quite happy to do um and two that it gave us more time to think about the
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00013.flac	um and and bruno was one of the big stars uh of the brain's trust i don't think anybody knew what he
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00014.flac	maybe that's as well because he at first sight he was i mean he was very a very short man but he
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00015.flac	burning eyes and burning conviction and he talked with a burning passion and intensity which which realy
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00016.flac	who decided that in order to bring some kind of coherence into science which is after all one way of looking at the
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00017.flac	that he would look at it historically and saw how human beings and the human mind and human thought moved into
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00018.flac	uh approaching towards the the essentials of realit
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00019.flac	working out the laws of nature he saw that as a historical
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00020.flac	but there was another thing about bruno and that is that not only was he a a a remarkable historian of science and pactsing scientist
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00021.flac	he had u a grasp of narative
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00022.flac	uh  rather complicated movements uh in which he would
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00023.flac	as though he was desperately trying to find this one word out of the whole
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00024.flac	um now i suppose if you started to think about that he would you would start with grustel ouldn't you something that had that kinda symitry left handed and
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00025.flac	an average documentary uh takes about three months to do from beginning to end
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00026.flac	um about one day at the cupfinal or something which obviously doesn't take that time but if you're going to take a considered subject three months is not unreasonable and if you're going to do a series of
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00027.flac	uh a sent of man off the air which was on the air which was i think probably just as well because it was um a very
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00028.flac	concept to get hold of involved a lot of research even for bruno
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00029.flac	um probably a a a greater achievement in the the the the problem of
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00030.flac	uh and i think what he ment was that it was an afirmation about
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00031.flac	um it was an afirmation of standards of scientific
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00032.flac	uh is paramount a paramount quality in civilization
id10203_22uUS8vq48c_00033.flac	he didn't need a lot of persuasion because he knew i'm sure that he had it in him
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00001.flac	uh and yet we wil be able to upploy all the complicated technology
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00002.flac	for three day it has big animals rh doing big things
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00003.flac	three tom elephent sel bul  fighting one another it has
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00004.flac	it's a wonderful place and uh so it has a sense of place it has a has sense of drama
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00005.flac	u i hope it was it was all the things i hope for uh and these
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00006.flac	great depth great numbers of them marag y provide you with the good
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00007.flac	and penguins wandering amongt elephent seles so that you suddenly get the forground of this emense creature looming up on you i thought it would be great tred and the
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00008.flac	wthousands pon thousands indeed hundreds of thousands of animals
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00009.flac	a breading place for a whole number of species that's why there's
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00010.flac	of turning uh wild animals into human beings and pretending that they have uh love stories or
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00011.flac	em uhhuman like names and soon i that's not my style uh and
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00012.flac	uh  three d film for big audiences and an
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00013.flac	e we have ended up producing is something that is at the same time zoologically absolutely
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00014.flac	uh but doesn't personalize but it none theless tells the story through the eyes of a single penguin and we haven't distorted
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00015.flac	after all as we all know don't fly so hand an on land they're out of theire element and they're not very agile so you can
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00016.flac	story inevitably if if you're doing a story of this kind it it has to involve a
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00017.flac	an the end is producing an eg and soon um and you're able to do that as as a distilation of the true thing
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00018.flac	one particular penguin as an example but of course we are able to use different ones
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00019.flac	things will go for for a little for king penguin cheks quite a bi
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00020.flac	the the king penguins have to feed they have to go out o scee so they they leave their
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00021.flac	looking after them and they can't be everywhere and the and and the pet of the jap petrals come in
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00022.flac	and elbo their way through like bruses that they are and it's very dramatic
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00023.flac	you know birds in dinner jakets standing around um um h that's true but it's only for a small part of their lives most of their lives what they're most
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00024.flac	um and their feet are at the end of the body which is why they have to stand vertically
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00025.flac	and he's got his addut fethers so he's therefore waterproof as it were and able to go to
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00026.flac	becomes sexually mature over a period of two or three years uh and then in some miracculous way which we only we are beginning to understand actually we know that bird navigation now depends like mot animal navigation
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00027.flac	uh so our character our king our
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00028.flac	and we pick him up at the moment when he is ready to breav and he's gotto get back to the iland where
id10203_H_FnbFOO5NI_00029.flac	was was hatched and he's gotta find himself a mate and he's gotta rear his chieck
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00001.flac	just go to all the lovely places see all the lovely things the things that fascinate you i mean the time you have tired of watching a bird of paradice is play or seeing ten thousand frominga
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00002.flac	now the carion cros a a tough bird but it can't crack warnuts
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00003.flac	and john said uh i'd originally written it for chimps and john said i think here's a chance we could get get
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00004.flac	get close so after about three or four days cralling around in roanda mu these giant stinging nettles and mud and celery and all terrible terrible time anyway we eventually got close to these guarillas and you could hear them i mean there they were and that we i came round and they were just up there and john said
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00005.flac	and give us the stuff about the opposable thum and forefinger and i say
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00006.flac	well yeah i he we had all this marvelous material he said well i we didn't really
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00007.flac	experience i mean i've never experienced anything like it and i will never experience it again adan the reason is
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00008.flac	gurillas well grillas and chimpanzes are so like well i said all that in the film but they are like us and you actually really felt that you're
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00009.flac	yes but somehow the whole business of being a kind of prim
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00010.flac	you it's a just an unforgettable moment on my life which i will never forget i loving
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00011.flac	wel the huge the marvelous thing to be able to turn ot on o a television a in between all these rod
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00012.flac	s and advertisments and nonsenses
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00013.flac	is  what i do is i i don't look at animals cause i think oh yes i should be
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00014.flac	oabso absolutely of course i mean that's why people are cientists because they are enthraled by the way the brainworks
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00015.flac	is that the world came to be the shape that it is and animals work in the way thathat they work and that we work in the way that we work and and that is romantic it's extraordinarima i mean the most romantic thing i remember as a child age seven hitting a rock seeing it fall open
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00016.flac	well i i hope not and believe that i certainly don't think um that the bbc will dum it down uh i mean if the  if public service broadcasting doesn't do that what's the point of having something
id10203_ITOzfL1nSD8_00017.flac	aans i can keep vertical and keep moving and people push me in front of things yes yeah because i i mean it's the best job in the
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00001.flac	really got it you know cause i've cause i've i've i've ive go away but i i've been doing playing lots of bad guys over the last coupleof
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00002.flac	yeah it'so i mean it's nois tha that they they can finally they can finally see ther aswhy daddy goes  goes away um it's it's it's great because they're they're really
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00003.flac	call the mountaintop which is uh you can find out about it do do o da the mountain

id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00007.flac	and the play proposes that he meets a misterious stranger in in in the night
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00008.flac	who um forces him to confront his mortality and the future of his people and it's it's very moving and it's very um it's very it's a very interesting play because it deals with
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00009.flac	and  asked the question you know is this the promised land you know you know   if if martain losha king were
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00010.flac	uum extraordinary changes i mean her we here we have as a saya a a a black a black president and um
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00011.flac	thuon one of one of the amazing things that i've discovered during my research was just how
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00012.flac	in america at that time how much racism uh hthat there was in in america at that time and to think that that same country cand then vote for a black president fifty
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00013.flac	back in my my school days i was given this speech to do it wa it was a section of the i have a dream speech and and i i didn't know what the i have a dream speech was i was only about twelve and um i remember
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00014.flac	play for the i used to play for the aknal uex professional celebority
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00015.flac	um bon merra register at the antini norlon trust go down to your localhospital because there are thousands of people out there whwho who need a who have lukemia or a a blod desease and the only thing they're waiting for is a is somebody who  with of a
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00016.flac	a similar tissue type because if it's a black person you have to have a black person who's blod an if it's a a a a chinese person they have to hve a chinese um you have to tyhte chinese tissue
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00017.flac	than it was twenty years ago uhwhich is when the register started we ui think we now need a more
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00018.flac	we're all in neneedle phobic nobody likes to to to to have needles and uh you know i i had to
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00019.flac	and then um on the fourth day i  say i was holked up to this machine but i you know if somebody asked me to sit cross leggl for four hours
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00020.flac	um thethe rum and the suger and an i think the carabean was one of the richest arieas in the world
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00021.flac	mflowing into the uh um uh british coffers so the owner of the plantation uh lord harwood uh was made well he was made a lord and all at the end of slavery when all the slaves were were
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00022.flac	fifty people toenand it's astonishing because we are all related
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00023.flac	and and it was amazing cause so many people come on went oh yes youre um from son so yes i know your father and itso it was sto
id10207_GGPNJOPyprk_00024.flac	was  wa was astonishing  sa we we showed them harwood we showed these thethese these people in barbadas hairwood house and they were like
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00001.flac	you you you can't you can't kindof get a get too above yourself in berming them you we um we like people to be kind af real and and uh as they are
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00002.flac	because i've been in lost angelis for the last eight months and i i i mean i've watched it on my computer but i had no idea just how people were taking to it here which
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00003.flac	extremely whealthy they make a lot of money selling some of these really horrible weapons to rather dubious regimes all around the world and they are given red carpet treatments around the world they are they sit at some of the top tables around the world
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00004.flac	seem to just navigate their ways through society uh really making a living off these truly awful
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00005.flac	i've become a professional american which  thi's extraordinary but um yeah i play a character
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00006.flac	unrestimated how difficult it was gonna be being an american in amongst so many british
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00007.flac	oasse that was probably one of the one of the toughest things that i' i'd done as an actor
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00008.flac	um which would be fantastic to be to be a part of uand u no hopefully things work out and i
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00009.flac	sic bthese rea classic british bydrama which we you know we wish we did more of them nd and und lecarries probably seconds a non
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00010.flac	there's no garantee that you're gonna go on to have suca successful career so i want to
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00011.flac	in america um nd itit can be quite brotal you know you can walk into a room
id10207_Hraaks5vmvk_00012.flac	it doesn'tmatterwho you are you could be in thechane or you could be a a beginner you walk in the room and you're treated exactly the same you've got eight minutes or three minutes to go and do you
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00001.flac	it was a letter from you know brown envelope from her magesty's government i just thought i'll i'll open that
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00002.flac	lk the courage up and and i i i i i kind of i hought o myself n i'm just gonna open that right now so i just peeled it open and i was really really i was
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00003.flac	i i'm not always supposed to but i i i told my mom and obviously my partner and and uh and im close friends i mean it's just i'm staggered really really staggered i mean you you never think that
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00004.flac	uh i' been filming a series called homeland which is umd uh a show a showtime show i in america it's got um fom fantastic fantastic actors claire danes damian lewis uh mandiypatinkan and iti think it's coming to channel for in the spring um and it's kind of based around the u the whole idea
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00005.flac	ot av been turned by the by acada it's and it's really got under the skin of the americans it's it's been a ral
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00006.flac	golden globes so not a bad start fof the year three golden globes and and um and a
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00007.flac	idea i i know that somebody has obviously gone ito bat for me and and whoever they are you know i really  take my hat off to them because they've i i i know that somebody's actually told me that that the process that they have to go through is is is quite a rigorous one so they've obviously have to write endless reports and and fill out endless lists and and really to say really go into bat for me so you know i thank whoever they are
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00008.flac	i think i think you know these are tough times in television um all around and i and i and i think i ou know gon of the days when we had you know longrunning shows like london's burning and the bill and
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00009.flac	very different uh um tdifferent days but that being said there's no dout that over the last four or five years um there's been an exadus of some of the top black british talent you know to america and they've you knowe they've they've been finding that they're you know opened they're playing roles of real authority real
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00010.flac	and tat's just on hwithout question um it's moving and it's changing and i think the likes of idrous elburr coming back and taking the lead in in series like lothe has proved thati
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00011.flac	yeah it's it's changing and it's a lot better from when i was growing up i mean you know i i remember watching ablack and wite minstral
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00012.flac	things have really changed that we we really have come along way it's it would be nice if we could go go that extra extra mile and and see a much more diverse uh uh  picture in advertizing and and and and inleading actors so you know we we have to live in hopeen and you know hopefully things will
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00013.flac	i i i did i lost ah i lost my best friend leie balcary who was you know i met when i was twelve years
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00015.flac	had together it was the one event that completely smashed me cn broke me and then can you believe i
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00016.flac	to me a kind of a spiritual message for him just to say go on lad get on with it you know it's time to move on and and you know this is this is the kind of
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00017.flac	my family don't think ive gota m an mye my my kids are my kids are very happy that i got home hot
id10207_OpnQ_ROfzVE_00018.flac	in the sun and swiming swuming every day and having a wonderful time so um you know it's i i'm just
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00001.flac	i really don't know i just got uh a letter seng from number
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00002.flac	because as you know um unfortunately bless him john sullivan the creator of it all he unf very unfortunately died and as he was a as nick lindheuarst used to say
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00003.flac	apparently it was uh it was part of some notes that john had left in his uh you know in his desk and it was re put together by his two sons jim and dan and they they
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00004.flac	you know would he do something of course and he said yes and during the course of the conversation he said he'd always wanted to work with uh he loved the show foand osistm could uhbe great if he could do something with me and
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00005.flac	as soon as you start putting the things together like you know he becomes aa
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00006.flac	uh dealboy would use a bit of french and uh rodny said you learn your french o of
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00007.flac	uhinvention but basically they were it it was just it was just john's way of saying that this character was one that wanted to impress and the way that you
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00008.flac	how it actually came about was that john sullivan and i were in the bar having a drink after one of the shows and he said to me i was in the wine bar the other he says you might like this dave he said i was in the wine bar the othe funny thing happend he said i was standing there having to drink and there was a bloke over by the bar and a
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00009.flac	point to where i understood what was really funny and what wasn't and by that i said i could do it and i'll do it and i'll fall right through
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00010.flac	bi used to be a alectrician and my partner and i we got a contract down ah
id10209_L0m5V31qj44_00011.flac	and when i got the script and uh i did the reading and they said would i go and play uh uh deal boy i said yeah and i spoke to the writer and i said what how did he view uh derek trotter and he said oh he was a guy with a flat cap and a big beer belly and uh you know this and and i said to him no no i know i
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00001.flac	was there were too unauthorized biographies of me and the people who put putting the book together wanted me to do it they sort of said at the end of the day they said look if you don't do it someone else will and isn't it better for you
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00002.flac	over the years they said you've had such an interesting career
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00003.flac	and i is er saying well the's i've got nothing to say really but when i anolized it and thought
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00004.flac	and uh and that's the story o very and i think the thing about it is that i discovered was
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00005.flac	where it perhaps may lead which is uh fame and fortune
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00006.flac	was that i could never ever quite fit it in because there was when you go back to fools and horces we get into a position where wel we want to do another series so we gotta start work on it now and in the meantime i would go back into the theater or i would be doing
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00007.flac	position where or we'll we want to do another series so we gotta start work on it now and in the meantime i would go back into the theater or
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00008.flac	ight never happen or do i keep working and my choice was id
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00009.flac	i had funny enough i had a meeting with clare cowill lady that was here in charge of comedy and uh we had a meeting with her and mark freeland who had a comedy in london and we're trying to find something to do and it came out of just an accidental conversation that was i wonder what ever happened to h granvill
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00010.flac	he thing about him was not only his vast talent and he had a great talent one which i would
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00011.flac	that he was also a gentleman but as apposed to a
id10209_MLj3rGRQ7Kg_00012.flac	he was he was so generous and kind and his feet were very firmly placed on the
id10209_zL68fxrFopY_00001.flac	um in those days that we all were desperate to move about anyway the long of the short ofthestory was a bicical
id10209_zL68fxrFopY_00002.flac	as my father being very ont pnarial he got some wooden blocks and put the

id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00002.flac	and she said she was running around the corner and then i came around dressed in a clown outfit that's what she told me this dream was and then she felt terrible that she said she had this dream cause we weren't engaged yet and so
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00003.flac	just stared there all day long just staring at her hand it was so sweet so
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00004.flac	fatastic and now i think she probably regrets that decision ev day since then like
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00005.flac	you'r as lucky as i am cause i've met your wife we're both outclahes wee both leveled up so
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00006.flac	well adem mackha said no h he was tired of hgetting the question cause when we were doing press for the second one that's the only qus hat's the first question they'd ask so hae abut a third one what reyou
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00007.flac	it just kept building on that last one we could really tell there was such aa fever for it um but i don't know if that might happen again i would do it every every year i loved doing those movies it's obviously an amazing crew of pel
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00008.flac	be like indulgent be like well we could'ave used it on our way to get christina out of the bear pit but originally it was getting christina out of she was captured she was

id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00010.flac	and it did go on forever i'll tell you alittle trivi about that scene if we have he time we were all not wearing pants
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00011.flac	there's a reason this guy's on ten ten programs um full circle is an amazing piece of theater i'm gonna call it i
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00012.flac	it's kind of like if if if anyone remembers the old playhouse ninety days where you would do a play basically so there are ten episodes and multiple characters and some of them intertwine
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00013.flac	and then shoot twenty two pages in one day where you normally shoot four or five so when yo shoot twenty two so it's like you're doing a
id10210_VRqtsKJVthk_00014.flac	and it is fantastic it's ah and exercise you rarely get to do anymore as an actor you actually get to rehearse which most days you show up and start shooting so we get to rehearse uh and we get to do this play basically ad they're filming it it's a really really cool project so i get to do one with uh patric uh foget and then the other one with colista
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00001.flac	u you know it's a commercial city but it's it's always taken the art seriously that's what's great for me so i never felt out of place when i said i wanted to be an
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00002.flac	in london but i grew u you know in the thing about liverpool is when i said i wanted to be an actor it wasn't weird the only weird thing was i wasn't saying i wanted to be in a band which was the big thing everybody everybody had their drumsticks or the guitar and live v pool that was the big thing but i went i had to go to the big city to go to
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00003.flac	yeah  edn' got a fin ight time you know but it was that thing that i came out to a a noyse of silence really when i
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00004.flac	and stuff and all these young fresh faced students would come in and they'd look at me and thi'd sort of embody their worst fers
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00005.flac	shakespeare and i was saying yeah that's three pound fifty u know come on and get home so so so i eventually had to get out of there and get ito a place far away from any drama
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00006.flac	m so some of them have gone on but there was uh there was a sense of you know being in there and them thinking that they were gonna walk out and be in tv series and then they're always doing a proper job and trying to make i
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00007.flac	uka and it was uh my calling card really at mean  i was the lead in this and it ment that whenever i went to auditions and stuff i wasn't just making stuff up and saying yeah you might just see me i got cut from that you know and they were able to see what i was in and that was
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00008.flac	you know  whenever i done shakespeare or beeng in the west end he's like oh yeah whatever but you know being and thes walking dead i've suddenly become cool to him you know
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00009.flac	it's like he's seeing me for the first time you know and his his friends like the show so it's sort of quite good you know and i can get him t shirts and stuff so it's all about what you can get him
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00010.flac	s uh i go cur da da can you geve me another one of those hats so
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00011.flac	his his gadfriends aren't so into i you know the thehis female friends but uh his his mates
id10216_9jOj0F3Snpo_00012.flac	i mean a it's got all of its big noises  it's got the zambes and all that stuff  it's about what you would do when you you know when you're up against it uh we all like to think that we're gonna be heroic when those things happen and that we're gonna you know the best of us will come out but we don't really knowhat's gonna happen until it
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00001.flac	the councels decision or whether to hold tight or whether to spend their way out
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00002.flac	the majority of people feel that they should be spending their way out of it whereas i don't i think we should be hunkering
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00003.flac	know it until it came as a script andrew davis's wonderful script and i went back to the novel and i loved it i
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00004.flac	before the book came out as well but the book actually feels like it was written in the fifties it feels like it was with retrasp
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00005.flac	she talks about the persecution of the jews and and the fear of going into that war or possible war and you feel that this is a book that's been written with the benefits of hindsight but she
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00006.flac	to see the socialist side of of britain coming to the fore and also you know him stuck in his conservative ways but yeah i think it's a it's not this chinking crystal world of britain it's not a place that is sort of
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00007.flac	the place the place that uh the hollis live which is this place called the shacks which is this
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00008.flac	being eaten away and you know there's a lot of people who think well we just can't do anything about that they'll just keep
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00009.flac	and other people asa uh dogihenel's character really wants to reform all that and rebuild that and that's you know those clash of
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00010.flac	red grave as lady macbeth so i'm really looking forward to that we're in early days we start rehearsals next month so i'm busy sort of reading every text
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00011.flac	what's interesting for me is it's at the liverpool everyman which is the theater i started in iti it was i was at the youth theater there and that was very much inclusive in the the main
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00012.flac	it's a you know it holds a great place in my heart and it's about to be knocked down it's about to be refurbished in that whole area of liverpool so it will be one of the last productions if not the last one to ever be performed there so it was a no brainer for me i just had to
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00013.flac	dealing with the supernatural then that does give it  an extra an extra spin but i myself have decided not to
id10216_U2gIBy8Gzss_00014.flac	ve been talking about um right now i'm starting yo gt supersticious about it but yeah i think you've just got to

id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00001.flac	i we we we're going to this church nere where i i live in north london and i was obsessed with my paster's daughter uh she
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00002.flac	would sit at the back of the church i didn't listen to a single sermon probably for about a year and then one day uh she she came up to me at the end uh of the service and
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00003.flac	and it's it's a tragic ending by the way um i walke up to
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00004.flac	drop the rose we get on the train we go to the to the um theater and she takes me backstage to this room where there are youyouth
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00005.flac	kept going cause i i liked her that much and uh before you know it um you know i i i
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00006.flac	we shot that for two two to three months yeah two to three months and um yeah
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00007.flac	to play someone of that magnitude you you've gotta go there so to speak i had the privilege of working with um uh forist witace on on a film i did called last king of scotland and and with danu day lewis my favorite actor of all time
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00008.flac	yeah well we sow a lot of it in atlanta and if you're gonna play docter king in atlanta where he's
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00009.flac	he doesn't enjenda much confidence uh so uh soso i decided to to stay an
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00010.flac	we were moving house at the time and i remember she called me uh once and said okay so david what are what are we gonna do is it is it the the brown curtain
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00011.flac	world war and um he was after that he was gonna go back and be king of his country but
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00012.flac	yes exactly right exactly right and uh but he fell in love with this white girl and um
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00013.flac	truly but because there was such a powerful nation in relation to great britain this was after the second world war and the cold war was just starting up south africa was supplying great britain with uranium to fight that war supplying great britain with gold and threatened to leave the commonwealth if they allowed this marriage that would take place just across the border in botswana to to to happen so great britain uh in my opinion behaved rather disgracefully and and decided to exile these two
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00014.flac	to marry which they did anyway the the the church wouldn't allow them to have a church wedding so they they ended up having a a civil wedding and um and then once they tried to go back to be in botswana uh the british government
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00015.flac	because botswana was a protectat of of the ouk and they said in order to help you guys not have ruions in your country we are going to help you by not letting you
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00016.flac	well i am actually a prince from nigera i know it sounds like showing off but it
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00017.flac	but i'n i'm in ainto in an interracial marriage myself so y the there are several things
id10218_D18oDGK8klQ_00018.flac	wel i don't  i've bbeen an a dressing room with him for three months i i i don't know
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00001.flac	yes uh i think that's fair to say um um but
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00002.flac	play you know in this role is everything i am as a man you know um who he was in terms of sacrificial love what he had by way of his faith what he did in terms of not just
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00003.flac	h uh a talker of the word but a doer of the word these are all things i really admire and aspire to do but also as an actor to get to step into his shoes briefly that's who i am professionally and who i am in life is what uh you know or who i try to be in life is what he was so you know it's
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00004.flac	i think what i not only found out but what i felt physically in my body is the weight of expectation the weight
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00005.flac	were killed uh during the course of this campain and they were killed because uh the methodology employed was we're gonna go into this place where there's clear injustice we're gonna have the cameras rol and we're gonna make these people act out on camera and they did and people died and you could argue that they may not have died if it wasn't at the behest of this
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00006.flac	you no longer had uh white racists not going to jaile for having killed people because you know juries were letting them off so you know i'm sure he knew that but it was still
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00007.flac	with incredible women he surrounded himself with as well that's one of the things
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00008.flac	came along and rewrote it the fact that you see dian nat you see amelia bointin you see annyli cooper um uh in in this film uh you see coreta you
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00009.flac	towards scivil rights she was the one who had who who had grown up in marrion uhalabama and and and like i say inspired him in this way so you know u
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00010.flac	and yet was able to distill their ideas articulate them and
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00012.flac	ana affect you um  and thankfully you know i think a lot of a lot of the love a love
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00013.flac	this is a man who was coled you know he was twenty six when he headed up the mongomery bossboy cot um twenty six i kwhat was i doing it
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00014.flac	he knew it and in his moments of dout in his moments when he wanted to turn around his faith
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00015.flac	and there was another victory every time more people rallied to the to the to the call of his voice he's his feeling of responsibility grew and his feeling of of uh courage grew and that's what enabled him to go up against you know world leaders and and advocate for people
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00016.flac	easily easily and maybe the most important thing i ever do and i'm okay with that because i think it's really timely i think there's something divine about it i was with docter king's youngest daughter uh just over the weekand and she said
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00017.flac	are engaging in this now um and uh ad and it's humanity coming together not just not just black people but now i think the erick garner situation really just made people go okay this is indisputable this is just wrong and you know what i hope someoene shows is that voting is crucial um we we cannot expect change when we have been given that power when that power has been bought
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00018.flac	issue of the day in salma was voting rights today it's police reform who's going to police the police you know it took federal intervention with the voting i think it's gonna take the same thing
id10218_c2JJdy42sWU_00019.flac	uh uh with the police brutality situation and um
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00002.flac	sume and he walked straight up to me i was in costume as dotor king and he said dotor king it is
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00003.flac	rozen uh by that because it was what a what a what a thing for him to say having not seen his friend for
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00004.flac	little strange at points i have to say you know because there was this
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00006.flac	sume and he walked straight up to me i was in costume as dotor king and he said doctor king it is
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00007.flac	rozen uh by that because it was what a what a what a thing for him to say having not seen his friend for
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00008.flac	um bumps in the road towards this this moment uh i actually got attached to the the project officially in twoo thousand and ten and still we struggled to get this film off the ground but when i look at what's going on in the nation now and it just being such a perfect time for this
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00009.flac	same and he walked straight up to me i was in costume as doctor king and he said dotor king it is so
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00010.flac	frozen uh by that because it was what a what a what a thing for him to say having not seen his friend for
id10218_hn6l9htbkRk_00011.flac	little strange at points i have to say you know because there was this
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00001.flac	isuh we only get the scripts kind of as we film them so we don't know where the story's going so from  from  uu somebody playing a police office r ht tat's quite
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00002.flac	um it's an u crine so it starts the th you saw just in in that little uh uh sequence there it starts on the steps of broad church police station the middle of the night uh julie hesman dalgh has uh turned up at te police station and asked for help she's been
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00003.flac	christiamor ur writer mmersed himself in getting this exactly right in in exactly what the proceders are when someone's suffered a terrible assult like this and uh i think it the
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00004.flac	one of broadchurchs kind of unique uh selling points if you will has been that it's it's not just about the crime and solving
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00005.flac	op who've been victims and to the and to the community around them and three years after a a boy dies ind sort of
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00006.flac	hearting from that and then this other awful event happens and and i think it's it's as much about the reality of what that
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00007.flac	e tecker's taking away yeah the pace maker's working but i mean you know hes e's gonna come
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00008.flac	now this is t well chris chipnel our our writer our sho runner he's off to go and run
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00009.flac	m ar i'm yeahi'm li donwan and and   don't want in soho it's a very moden take on the
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00010.flac	just approaching well we we two wees of rehearsals left so just get ing to the kind of
id10221_QfJhW6GMCG0_00011.flac	normal is mad to be normal about ardin ling the the sixty's counter culture
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00001.flac	and and throuwhingto peter davison as well i'm still watching when when he was we when he
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00002.flac	and i  you kind o  you kind of can't really think about it when you have  little objective moments
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00003.flac	be seen but i certainly intend to do another one at the moment that's the that's that's what i'm planning on doing uh at the
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00004.flac	i find that's fn i'm  i'm happy to ecept whatever aductive yo flying out
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00005.flac	's alite about that yes there's a thre's a similar moment actually um yes harry potter for i'm in that
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00006.flac	banish those thoughts from peter's head on chrismas day but i think you know as an actor you want to do a variety of different things you want to do as big a variety as possible uh and it's it's great for me to have been able
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00007.flac	to to be now going into doctor who which is a ah ar family show and is is is very kind of
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00008.flac	it t has a very different feel to it um ufrom an acting point of vew that's what you know that's what we want to do a  big o aritin thig
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00009.flac	it's more straight forward and that russel writes it and sinds me this gre so go oll that's good bas russl and you just kinda do it cause i mean he's such an extraordinary
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00010.flac	you just when you get a script from him you just kind of piri  get stec into it and he gives you so many brilliant lines and different ways you can take it that you just kind of role with it and and i think that's how we've been doing it really we we're kind of responding to what each other's is giving each other and and and and and and if there so there's no wek
id10221_lgd4nXqlPpQ_00011.flac	we didn't want to gonna sit down and go let's make it self conciously quirky let's make this docter different by giving him pink hair or or a parrot on his shoulder r because then you just get into gemicry really and i think you've gota it's gotna be for all that it's fantastic and extraordinary
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00001.flac	uhabout two months early but you'll have seen there it's a it's a bit nackard  it's beeng taken off the uh the container uh boat and they dropped a container uh cartin on top of it
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00002.flac	well when i read the script was quite an emotional moment and i there are a few emotional moments obviously in in uh in the telling of that story but uh
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00003.flac	it's it's ben a fantastic time and i'm i'm having a bol doing it and it
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00004.flac	the end is now but um you know ifits ill got a good way to go and it itll be till the end of the year before i'm
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00005.flac	cand i it's not you know hit's just part of the job i have tit' usually it's not it's usually not a sexual thing with a
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00006.flac	i think it's only gentlemanly for me to say they were both equally good and very
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00007.flac	um you see i don't like to pick favorites like that i think they're all
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00008.flac	hey'reall they're all exciting and scary and thrilling and  the scurious is whatever you
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00009.flac	e filming them at the moment they are they are some of the best scripts we've ever had it's very exciting an some amazing guest stars some of whom you know we've been we've been pictured we've been filming in the streets of carif this week and some of our guest stars have have already been leaked there are some e'ven bigger ones than people don't know about yeat it's
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00010.flac	well again but uh he's very excited he's he uh i think he's a great choice and he's very he's very upfor it and ready to
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00011.flac	i meani think he is yeah yeah ad there's a lot of great people around him so uh he
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00012.flac	t was props our worth quite lot of one and uh and of course the series carries on so i i i can't exactly take a
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00013.flac	ce was off the screen for  a long time i mean that there was a  a a an attemt to reviveit ninety six but that didn't really wort
id10221_vZySewkDmnk_00014.flac	i'm hosting jonathan roser's show he's off for eastar so u cathrin tate and i are gonna try and be djs for three hours uh from ten o'clock which
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00001.flac	i think it's wonderful i think any opportunity to bring the fans and the cast and the producers and the writers together it's always i mean that's that's why
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00002.flac	you know share and experience an artistic experience from performer artist
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00003.flac	you know the audience and i think that it's wonderful because we're all one really we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for them watching the show and i think it's really great that they have this uh this outlet to bring us together and talk about you know what's interesting about the show and what's wonderful and what's compelling and people's opinions i think it's i think it's great i think they should do i
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00004.flac	interested in in what's gonna happen with every character and how whatever happens to another character relates to my character and that's the wonderful thing about uh being on a series if you're hon a
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00005.flac	characters no matter what happens to one character it's gonna affect all the other ones so uh that's that's always a great thing for me that if i hear that you know uh cs le's character masuka something's happening with them it's going to affect uh my character
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00006.flac	like a new feeld of play as an actor to explore and to sink your te
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00007.flac	that's why i i i you know when they say o how can you do a series for so long you kiddi me i would
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00008.flac	cause there's so many aspects of that personality that you can
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00009.flac	and it's always rewarding as an actor to dive in there and find certain things that you may not even have known about that
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00010.flac	particular individual of that particular character and so that's that's always a good
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00011.flac	i you know i i i really look at it i i guess i'm a positive person cause i don't have too many negatives
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00012.flac	i i it's always sad when it ends and you have to wait uh you know months to come back because you've invested so much in yourself in the character so that's maybe the fustvating thing i wish it was a little bit
id10224_4ivjaIuPQG4_00014.flac	u yeah i'm i'm very busy i'm gonna be doing a aa movie coming out with sevestes e lone calle the expendables i'm um filming a movie right now called skyline about uh sience fiction
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00001.flac	and exactly because of what you just said it's exciting that nuvotv is gonna show it to a whole new demographic of of people of latinos of and um every monday at nine pim two episodes the whole
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00002.flac	m every monday at nine pim two episodes the whole series from beginning to end
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00003.flac	you know the the great thing is i think that every character was interesting and every character was interesting in relation to the story of dexter and uh and the writers did a great job doing that particularly in in maintaining the integrity of our characters when it came to our athnicity our culture um and i i was really excited every time i read a script and uh we really it was itit was a great eight years to play the
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00004.flac	well for me you know the show is about a a man who uh because of a tramatic event when he was baby uh has aquired a sickness that uh that he needs to satisfy uh which is killing people uh uh serial
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00005.flac	and um being involved in the world as his dad was a was a police officer and he he taught him how not to get caught and how to now satisfy his urges in in a code that will then help society in getting rid of uh other really bad people uh whether they're killers or chil malesters or uh he found a uh
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00006.flac	a a code to actually satisfy his urges and uh also
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00007.flac	uh image of normal life in in his world
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00008.flac	and uh and and it's it was is an interesting concept and what's interesting about it as you get to hear uh everything he's thinking everything he's planning why he does what he does and he shares it with the audience so the audience knows more about this character than any of his closest friends or his sister or anybody else and uh and that leads to
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00009.flac	you know the the great thing is i think that every character was interesting and every character was interesting in relation to the story of dexter and h
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00010.flac	butista's wardrobou tis  found i always i always what i liked about it is that he was definitely you caun always you know point him out in a cro
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00011.flac	he had a uniqke wardrob which is what i liked about the character as well um and i think he maintained that whether he was in a
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00012.flac	a little more conservatism i guess no but i think that he always had that you know with the hats and just the the same kind of you know
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00013.flac	unique shirts that he ware that was a little different from a normal hamaside detective i would say
id10224_LRY_3UWNNl4_00014.flac	o want people to discover it as they go along i think this is a good opportunity for them to uh to watch the uh you know all the uh all the surprises and that are gonna come uh within those uh ninety six
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00001.flac	david zaes om dexter don't go anywhere caulse profil
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00002.flac	viewer except except the viewe yeso yeah and what he does is um his code in
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00003.flac	in killing people a he kills other serial killers or other bad people people that you know uhe would say you know would
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00004.flac	sargent angel patista who works alongside of dexter and uh is his friend and um doesn't know what he
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00005.flac	well yeah i i wouldn't put it i mean the sopranos was huge the sopranos was iconic um but it is it is uh one of those great cable shows that have been coming up you know in the last ten years and i think uh dexter you know is is probably one of the top five there i think
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00006.flac	yeah he's uh you know and he's got a tough job cause he's there every day almost
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00007.flac	to where where he wants to take that character and he just knows exactly you know it's it's a very structured and very interesting performance that he gives and uh he's x
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00008.flac	i think it has to do with the quality of the show um uyou know we don't nobody really knows how successful the show is gonna be till te sts airing but i think the quality of the quality of the show and and uh
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00009.flac	and just the reputation that it has within you know within the world of of show business i think that it attracts a lot of good actors keth carradine for one was was just wonderful i learned a lot from keth carradine he's um a professional at every level and of course this year jimmy smits who i've worked with before on broadway um is just a a
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00010.flac	and then they switched me to menhattin and i worked in uh central park i worked in manhattain or tasvorce which we worked mostly in the three four washington
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00011.flac	ways uh wanted to be an actor i mean i was always been a dream of mine um but you know i come from a very blue color background so that kind a was like a dream outside of the reality of what was uh going on in my life uh i got married young i had two uh two children
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00012.flac	and uh i joined right after high school i i did like a year in college and t wasn't for me and i joined the air force and i did five years in the airforce and um
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00013.flac	u city test andi went right into the police department and i did fifteen years and then about halfway into that um had a bad year i got devorced i went bankrupt and i said well this is a
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00014.flac	i started going to a acting class and and studying a lot i really got into it i did a lot of theater a lot of uh
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00015.flac	i studyd with this uh wonderful teacher called earny martin who's probably uh one of the best teachers in new york  people don't know i mean he's he's just
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00016.flac	u taught a lot of great actors and um and then i got into this theatr
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00017.flac	i have with that is you know you get for example if i was playing a doctor and they giving me all this jargon medical jargon it would take me forever to i try and figure that out uh being a police officer in the past there's a lot of technical aspects of of whether when you read a script ouh when you read a play
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00018.flac	a lot of that you know even just the the way a police officer you know stands the way he walks the way he you know he observes the uh the location all of that pretty much comes naturally to me you know and so uh it gives me the amentagto really work ar in the character work of uh of
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00019.flac	and you know what i don't mind i' i'll i'll i'll play as many cobs as they want me to play you know i think to me if the role is interesting it doesn't matter what it is you know if i if i see something if i'm reading a script i'm reading a play i'm reading a
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00020.flac	a a tv show  a film if the the character's interesting to me what that character is whether it's a cop whether it's a a killer whether it's a a priest it doesn't matter if it's interesting if it catches me u something that i
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00021.flac	to be a vigilanty to be a superhero i don't believe that was the the the backdrop of that i think that maybe it's developed that way because people uh you know wanna see it that way i think he's just uh he's a human
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00022.flac	at aside from that little aspect he lives an normal life and he's probably a re a decent human being i's just that one i mean u uthere's people out there that are decent human beings that have these addictions or have these urges that they need to
id10224_jH3-NrmEhjg_00023.flac	lot of people or not that it's condoned but it's understandable in his mind that i can do this i could take care what i need take care of to satisfy my urges and
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00001.flac	of someone who had a plan when it comes to my curr quite a lot of it has been an accident and i wouldn't recommend that
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00002.flac	during the day at a big comprehensive school in london and then i would go and perform at night and and five pounds a week for performing
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00003.flac	e loved it and the moment came when i had to make a decision because everybody else who was performing at the comic stript were free to go on tor to
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00004.flac	bui was not free because i had a proper grown up day time job so i had to make a big decision about whether i was gonna jump off
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00005.flac	initially uh but i knew that i had to follow my heart with it in fact itt it is a calling without adout you you cannot get rid of those
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00006.flac	creative you have to follow your heart and so i made a decision right there that i would leave teaching for now and then move into performing and that's when i knew that that's what i'd do because i would take
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00007.flac	returning into education in a way that i've always wanted to and with time and
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00008.flac	you know with as my decrepitude creeps on nan dagles and as i become more delusional um i i you know i want to teach more and where
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00010.flac	i keep on going is because every new project is a change and i have tried to change from uh comedy acting to serious acting to writing to uh a one woman show that i did last year which i rehearsed here at falmoth with one of the falmoth
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00012.flac	about that and that's why i fell into my career thank goodness almost by accident later on i think i would have got going earlier and how great to have these resources and by the resources i mean not just the buildings and the amazing facilities
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00013.flac	earlier on i i can't imagine what it would be have been like and to know that the that this
id10225_H0Ad5CtDv_A_00014.flac	left cormal to go and seek an arts education if i had known there was an art
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00001.flac	true yes because uh i'm halfway through my second novel at the moment and i am longing to get
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00002.flac	so uh it's i i feel like i just wanna get back down to cor well a
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00003.flac	push through i read that gram green said just write anything anything to
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00004.flac	even when you type something up but i find that when it's on the type page
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00005.flac	gad that s homework i think um i used to ask len i certainly when i did my memo i asked him you know
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00006.flac	hi's not me she is a woman kind of my age and i've tried to write in this book
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00007.flac	she's a a kind of dangerous age where if somebody pays a bit too much attention to her outside the marriage she could get a bit giddy and that's
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00008.flac	but i've tried to deal with something that i think i fear the most which is that you can take your eye off the ball a bit sometimes with your family and with your kids and whilst you do that and
id10225_wnyMJdJEa10_00009.flac	and i have seen it happen with i guess in certain moments with my daughter i have been busy working or something like

id10225_xOlm69WCj4M_00005.flac	i've written about in this book i mean this young woman does make a decision she's running away from something a little bit um and she makes a decision on the plane that she's going to say yes to more things than she ever
id10225_xOlm69WCj4M_00006.flac	because there there are some sourcy scenes in this book obviously uh they're very
id10225_xOlm69WCj4M_00007.flac	i have to take myself there in my head and at that moment i think right well this is the sort of thing that might happen there this is a

id10227_YEDm4QCiePQ_00005.flac	i wasn't too keen on those that was uh that wasn't the most comfortable outfit on earth but playing a bad guy is great because you get too
id10227_YEDm4QCiePQ_00006.flac	ye have no morality in that sense you can just kinda let it fly and that was fun but playing opposite denzel is you know for me as an actor it was most it was
id10227_YEDm4QCiePQ_00007.flac	i mean that you could ask for nothing more and uh you know i hope the film does well here it's it's a it's a hot steamy movie which will be nice

id10231_DqItcKbKblE_00001.flac	single episodes were what the people brought to me the fans i mean they always spoke about it in the generalness of they all the shows helped them they
id10231_DqItcKbKblE_00002.flac	know what i  saying but they didn't come about only one time i remember this time because o the way it happened i'm on a

id10231_DqItcKbKblE_00008.flac	my husband was twenty six years old we nothing wrong with him he just
id10231_DqItcKbKblE_00009.flac	and i have two children i didn't know what to tell my children cause i doidn't know what to tell
id10231_DqItcKbKblE_00010.flac	in going home made me know that my husband was comfortable
id10231_DqItcKbKblE_00011.flac	ad daddy's fine he went on a trip he wanted to go on and we'll see him again someday
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00001.flac	he he remembered the first situation comedy he was at
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00002.flac	he wasn't writing the show he was the star of the show but he had so much
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00003.flac	bn an entertainer so long that he had an answer for almost everything he danced
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00004.flac	jack would do an act with him playing the
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00005.flac	they're now they're off that just that much and they'ld be off and they would entertain us oon the rewrite days and the days when it took too long to get the script and you know so it was it was all fun and games it was
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00006.flac	i was i had a roach coach uh uh mel on
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00007.flac	the land that jacks guaroge was standing on and so that's how i was
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00008.flac	the coach so i was on the premise a lot and jack did things that were not in his lease and that's how we had this back and forth going you know he he put cans out where they shouldn't be he knew they shouldn't be there but he his character was whatever i
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00009.flac	to do that and so we had this between us all the time and
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00010.flac	came uh like i was his mother he began to on the set act like that you know like we
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00011.flac	ui was his gardian or his mother or something and whoever was writing said let's put
id10231_PyZ7LqrciCs_00012.flac	and so that became that became my relationship with him when jack got on his nerves he would come across the ale and uh talk to me and uh we'd figure out something
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00001.flac	present himself as some of my best friends are black i know a lot about black people and i've been with black people all my life which is very offensive in its connotation very offensive
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00002.flac	and you like him why do you have to pull that out you don't come in and you say um i i knew some spanish be i knew some irish people i knew some english you don't do that people are people and so that friction ran between
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00003.flac	uh the produce one of the producers and i can tell you how to be funny if i want to and red was saying
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00004.flac	came to interview red and so we're rehearsing a scene and all red had to do
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00005.flac	and i said he's having an interview with entertainment tonight i said but he doesn't have any
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00006.flac	and brings red out and when red gets out there and finds out all he has to do is walk across the back of this that anybody
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00007.flac	and he was laying on the floor and i leaned down to him and i put my hands on him he said get my wife get my
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00008.flac	get my wife gom i said somebody get parametics and somebody col get mises fox and they went and got her
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00009.flac	the doctor comes out and says uh ms fox we've done all that we
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00010.flac	television that way again because of if something happened to me and they treated my husband and my daughter that way i
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00012.flac	and sat her in there and he never got the treatment he needed he was not uh fased out of it like he
id10231_ifZ7CFu7Pik_00013.flac	ad i didn't get sick or something and so he was no longer an it just one day he was there and oe
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00001.flac	the name ligavitis struck me because in uh i gess i wasn
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00002.flac	en ninety um uh guy named richard  gabres was nominated for an oscra for the fisher king and when i i think it was nineteen ninety
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00003.flac	up in boston named i who was there for like two yearsand then dropped out and disappeared right so can't be  ame guy can't be this and and so teddy met with the writer to see what his take
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00004.flac	on this film with g um and e was involved the whole way through and he's gotta great sense of humor and i knew him everybody loosened up it was great and uh even when keven and judy came on
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00005.flac	they uh everybody uh got along great and everybody cracked everybody else up and it was
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00006.flac	you know there's not a lot of it so you go on stage at stand up comedy clubs because you can ust get up ther yo o have to worry you know about how much you get pad and you just you go up for ten miutes andyou can talk so you get to work with some skills instead of you know at you'r waitwaiter ritering job a your you'r uh job at a diner whatever it is so that's what brought me to it originally cause i was out of work as an actor and then you you get up there and you sort of enjoy that uh ah performance uh skill which is different from from you know acting with a fourth
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00007.flac	like uh being in the moment you know you really have to be completely in the moment when you're doing stand up comedy especiallyi you're if ou're not a joke teller if you're sort of just somebody who makes observations or tell stories you have to be right there because the audience is there is no fourth wall and anything can happen people can can react to you and and vocalyu whatever so you're always like right here you're very
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00008.flac	you know there there is no greater uh immediate thrill than having it when it's working and it's going well
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00009.flac	and to play um other angles and emotions inside of yourself that's what you get to do in film and it
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00011.flac	d uh and there's there everybody's had the experience of having to be some place at a family gathering on christmas eve or thanksgiving whatever it might be where you you ssometimes things just don't you don't wanna be with everybody you wanna be with one of the people maybe cause you like them or maybe there's that one you're trying to avoi and you wanna bewith the other ones but there's always some inightmare
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00012.flac	yeah and the laughs come from from from the characters and not so  so mun so much f the
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00013.flac	i mean even the kids you know are upset about the presants they're getting which is just true to a lot of kids when you're getting a that that weird age when
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00014.flac	family uh they all have a great sense of uh story telling they tell great storis they have big senses of humor um so i think it's
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00015.flac	you know you know so it's almost like being in grt sho were they go here's a camera go out and you know and brig het
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00016.flac	if i'm if i'm gonna uhif i'm gonn enjoy it and if it's if it's a challenge and so far everything the next thing has always been sort of a challenge you know uh moving from doing a one man show into
id10233_4qBx8uXR1I4_00017.flac	that uh that's a dramatic pieace that we're at some point in the future  hopefully gonna do we we wrote it with aadiis it's a it's about
id10233_JwQW8afmqUQ_00001.flac	n the closite thing forget about that even if they wave that rule you know just some of the things that they always gome backin to your passt and try to get stuff they can come back to
id10233_JwQW8afmqUQ_00002.flac	no like my skinny gean squad there's gonna be a squad there's gonna be people in government vans they're gonna drive around and pick up people that shouldn't be
id10233_JwQW8afmqUQ_00003.flac	talk about you know the whole lack of civil rights during the bush administration i'm sory i'm pulling you right off the street and we're giving you clothes that you'e gonna be okay and this is not just fat people this is like skinny people wearing crazy outfits we're just gonna take you off the street so that's just the beginning of my
id10233_JwQW8afmqUQ_00004.flac	a you can walk down the street and sport i'm serious you turn on the thing and you get
id10233_JwQW8afmqUQ_00005.flac	and you're just a a humanatm and a sefer

id10236_2LKbJWmXnj4_00008.flac	uh extended footage of the movie said a lot of the scenes are expanded so you'll see like uh um like fictures behind the scene you'll se the a jason looks like underneath the mask so we shot scenes where it revealed what it looks like um what else is there there's uh there's scenes like where ou see like travis van winkle the uh the trent character um an extended kill
id10236_2LKbJWmXnj4_00009.flac	that was i actually come up behind him with a machete with the blade turned up i slide it between his legs uh making a rather falic look and i grab him uh rigrab the uh uh other end of the machette and i pick him up in the air and
id10236_2LKbJWmXnj4_00010.flac	or the uh the brief sex scenes that happen in the theaatrical cut are't so brief in the killer cut they're u i i got to thepoint where ia'm uncomfortable i'm watching them mi okay whatthe
id10236_2LKbJWmXnj4_00011.flac	which i haven't seen yet uh but what i hear is there's a uh awhat's called a trivia track but normally that means there's like popp ups like like this happened here and just words about trivia for the film but what it actually is i's a little picture in picture and it runs throughout the entire length of the uh the movie where you'll see of course trivia but it's basialy lo miny document or you'll see
id10236_2LKbJWmXnj4_00012.flac	ta little strange having a uh the the dvv camera guy brad bradbaro follow me around twenty four hour
id10236_2LKbJWmXnj4_00013.flac	acting like a four year old you know with a machetty like sord fighting with the tree or something like making voices uh of course i 'd stop and look over and brad would be right there

id10236_QKt-HgXtwxo_00006.flac	ost to what happened or r what we we've seen impart one uh i believe they wrote it so they could fit anywhere but it's almost as if it were a
id10236_QKt-HgXtwxo_00007.flac	um but it gets back tit's it's hard ar it's back to what we want or it's brutally violent and uh it's a a roler coster ride when i read the script there was like hardly any breating room it's always something happenes somewhere move move move by the time i was done reating t for the first time i was exausted so i'm i'm excited to see how it turns out i haven't seen anything besides the
id10236_QKt-HgXtwxo_00008.flac	go odn do whatever he wants or to have some stand in do the lines it was super freezing he was the one with the wearing the least amount of clothes
id10236_QKt-HgXtwxo_00009.flac	you are an amazing human being so a lot of re spectagerat he's a great great
id10236_QKt-HgXtwxo_00010.flac	knew uh what he knew today that i was gona be in a uh amazing predator sut i would lose my
id10236_QKt-HgXtwxo_00011.flac	uh uh a tall our director on set he would jump up and down and scream enjoy and go
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00001.flac	edward is uh a giant trole in hansel and grettel who is inslaved by the evil witch muriel um he has a struggle because uh um he's
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00002.flac	harof gold and he wants to do the right thing by helping gretel out but uh he has to overcome his own fear of uh being punished from uh
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00003.flac	troles are born to serve witches and he was born the kind that serves the white witches u which are the good witches and being that they're
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00004.flac	he has no no purpose no no one to serve um he tells a story about coming across and meeting muriel and she could have killed him but she doesn't and so he as sworn
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00005.flac	he lives in fear of you know being hurt by her and so when he finds grettel
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00006.flac	he has a connection to her he realizes that she is a white witch which grettel at the time doesn't know and
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00007.flac	he's lived his life without a purpose and that's his purpose and he's conflicted because he has to overcome
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00008.flac	and uh it's cold it's rainy everyone is you know ou ol huddle together for warmt
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00009.flac	on set is a hoot uh it's so wild because being that he's a newer director uh and this is  first big hollywood film
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00010.flac	i've seen directors in the same position be under so much stress uhtrying to get their idea across and there's so many different things going on an they become overwhelmed ith what'
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00011.flac	with the edward character it's pretty crazy uh it's uh for myself as an actor it's like i'm
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00012.flac	i see out the character's mouth when it's open uh but in the scenes it's very rarely open uh so you as an actor you almost have to take a mental picture or photograph of what you
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00013.flac	where that is for your movement because during the scene i'm completely blind and a lot of times you think you can use your sense of touch to feel what's going on but my hands in the character stop about just below the rist of edward and they're giant anmatronic hands and we have a um like uha a guy from pta on each of the hands controlling them
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00014.flac	everyone's trying to row the boat in the same direction we all wanna accomplish the same gols and um just had such a good time with
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00015.flac	a lot of that comes from tommy tommy set the pace for the the the feel of the show that ha he's so kind and generous
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00016.flac	what i really enjoy about the film is that it's it's uniqe in a way that it's not just a a strict fantasy genra film thfantasy's a part of it you have uh the comedy you have
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00017.flac	uh uh like stand by me or a goonies as a child that that action adventures a of a of a
id10236_Zel66VhvJvE_00018.flac	into this film and so it's such a huge demograpic you'll find something thatyou like in the
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00001.flac	i you know i try to deny it sometimes like oh you know i  created this character not everything is autobiography but i relate to mais
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00002.flac	yeah you know i'm we're both writers we're we both tend to write about teanagers which is kind of a a strange fixation um we both awake up in the morning and drink di
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00003.flac	some unhealthy habits there um however i i don't think i'mh
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00004.flac	first of all just the shear amount of effort that goes into making a film but then even when you get past that to just watch a director inespecially a director like jason who's so incredible interpret what you've written and then you have someone
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00005.flac	and they're up there reading stuff that i wrote you know alone it's a
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00006.flac	i was i i was completely ano i'm in  every time i watch the movie i'm i i'm not
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00007.flac	misterious to me because i am not myself an actor and i don't i just don't know how she can transform her
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00008.flac	uh everybody knows he's this incredible comic i mean he's he's brilliant but it's i don't think people are aware of what a great actor he is and they will be when
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00009.flac	you know i think about it i i i went through a pasewhere i think i was uh
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00010.flac	i it is it i was sometimes shocked by how much people put out there like do you really want like creepye old me from your high school looking at your kid's
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00011.flac	that's the weird that's a very it's a very strange time and it also is one of those things where
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00012.flac	obviously really amazing and humbling but it's also like
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00013.flac	yeah an that's  that that was he that's the working title i think we're gonna do something differently but it's yeah it's i'm gonna direct in a couple months and
id10239_HredgbboXlU_00014.flac	and actavia oh my god who by the way is you know having a a really amazing run
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00001.flac	initially have marylin mind i you know and i would never i would ever be that
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00002.flac	because she gets so many scripts and you know i you can't assume that she's gonna do yours but um as i the the longer i worked on the script the more i started to think it has to be her because she just i i just i knew she could knock this role out of the park so i was very very excited when i
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00003.flac	wasn't i i thought that i i thought that i i was gonna have to talk her into it and that's why we were having dinner and so i was prepared and i had this whole speel and it was like i'm gonna i'm gonna convince meril streep to do this movie and it turned out when she had arived she'd already made her mind up and so when she started talking about you know production i just i wanted to jump up and down and scream but i
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00004.flac	what happened and it it was such a great decision that our director jonathan demy made he said he didn't want anything in the movie to be artificial or caned or done in post production he wanted all the music to be recorded live and everybody had to be playing their instrument and singing so that's definitely a more challenging way to shoot a musical film but like
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00005.flac	movie so i was acting in a couple of capacities and you know typically i
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00006.flac	you know i'm very respectful of that collaboration but it's it's great when they need you as a writer
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00007.flac	it's you definitely have to really really trust the people you're working with because you write the script and then it's pretty much out of your hands you're you're at the mercy of the director's
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00008.flac	um it's strange though it's not what i expected i kinda thought after i had kids that i would start writing scripts about raizing little kids and being a young mom and no i'm not young but you
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00009.flac	i that strangely enough that wasn't my instinct and now instead i'm writing about someone who'se children are an adule
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00010.flac	one moment that i can not forget you know what i had a camio in the movie and i got to dance in the bar and in in front of the flash the band you know while they were performing and meryl was singing her heart out and i was just doing my goopy dance moves and
id10239_fylBZFmIPsA_00011.flac	vagus you need to go see ricki in the flash you have my guarantee that you will love this movie it'shighly entertaining heartwarming
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00001.flac	mayvis gary is u author of young adault fiction and she lives in many
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00002.flac	to her entire life and she finds herself at a place where suddenly there's something that she wants and can't have and it's her ex boyfriend who is married and she decides that she is going to drive to her hometown break up his marriage and get him
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00003.flac	it started um as just a desire to see a female anta hero on on screen
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00004.flac	i can't even remember what movie it was that set me off but i had gone to see yet another movie with a really dark complicated interesting male protagonist who was you know kind of a curmudgeon and really flaed and maybe an addict and i and it was you know tueforc performance for the guy and i thought
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00005.flac	that was my primary objective when i began but of course it can't just be about making a statement you have to find a story that
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00006.flac	and a character that speaks to you and so that is how mavis began to
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00007.flac	i was so thrilled when jason wreitman called me and said
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00008.flac	because i honestly i i never dreamed of working with somebody like her she is just the
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00009.flac	she's just at the top of her game she's got an oscer she's an
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00010.flac	bravery i i think it can be difficult to be associated with a character like this you really have to have guts to say that i'm going to be mavis
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00011.flac	during the judo process to be there for a lot of it and jason is a really great collaborator um this time
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00012.flac	i was you know caught up in my personal lifes but i was at home watching dailies and every night i would get this round of dailies and i would think to myself like whe  look what they're
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00013.flac	the great thing about working with jason is i don't feel that i have to explain myself like there's just no
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00014.flac	and u ther love scene i guess you could call it but it's really okward i know spoiler
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00015.flac	i i i remember seeing scenes from it and thinking like oh my gosh this is incredibly uncomfortable what is this going to be like
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00016.flac	mavis and mat are a really unusual pairing because she is the type of guy that he would that that she he is the type of guy that she would ordinarily never look at and in fact she went through four years of high school without ever looking at him even though he was like basically her locker mate um and yet i love that he goes from being a person that she would
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00017.flac	she cares about most and the one person she needs the most because they in a lot of ways have the same
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00018.flac	a lot sweeter than she is and he has uyou know an essential warmth and goodness but when it comes down to it he's a sinnic to
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00019.flac	my hope is that people feel that they have seen something that um
id10239_vjh4tv5CleM_00020.flac	because u i i think that the ending to this movie is ambiguous and it's challenging and even in even along the way
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00001.flac	oh it took about six weeks of rehearsal dance rehearsal a probably a week or so you know every day we ould do some more of the we rehearsed on the disney back alot in ninety five degree heat we're
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00002.flac	ie i've had so much fun wie that i've often wondered whether i was making an honest
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00003.flac	this i was not and  they started putting that lether sut on e i sai are we doing moter sichals ar
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00004.flac	uh i kept asking people whatever happened to stan laa nobody knew one day i was looking in the phonebook and i there it was i said stan larral not stanlie so i called him up and introduced myself and he knew who i

id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00008.flac	dickand bob shrimarn wrote the songs for both of those movies and there's nobody like him around anymore all those songs are so
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00009.flac	the eivan dike show and uh in those day i knew i was nominated it was just a little dinner party it was never
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00010.flac	they had sent me a wire and about a week afterwards i just have to look
id10242_NilzUXpSsvk_00011.flac	and it' said congradulation you won the toney you know and was all by
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00001.flac	directing a film that his partner norman leer wrote called divorce american style based on norman's life i understand and bud was a pleasur to work with it it it was deby renels and bud york and and me wen it was
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00002.flac	i never never did i think i left a bad taste in norman's mouth i'll tell you one experience i had in te
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00003.flac	nineteen fifty six or seven when she came to new york and
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00004.flac	did her i love you john fouster dullis and we both started appearing on the gary more show together so we've known each other all those years he's co
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00005.flac	the other english people but i think i was one of the few americans in it i think there was one or two other people who actually weren't british you remember arther treacher who played the constable
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00006.flac	well as i said i was  fan of his from the time i was old enough to go to the movies my mother oud have to come on saturday and drag me out of ol and hardy movies and when i was
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00007.flac	and asked people whatever happened to stand all nobody knew i was looking for a phone number in the sannamonica phonebook and
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00008.flac	i spent that afternoone with hem and several after
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00009.flac	dicky if if anybody ever plays me i want you to and then when he passed away i was invited to do the uh ulogy at his
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00010.flac	he was the guy h practically put me in the business we were online traines ind the what was then the army airforce and i told youbiron uh
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00011.flac	an the what was then the army air force and i told you by
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00012.flac	brought me at his own expense before the sbs execks and they put me under contract which got me
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00013.flac	doing my act so my mother and father and jerry drove all the way out here in their old chevy
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00014.flac	he went home to high school goht a partner bought all the records he were patamiming and started
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00015.flac	yeah just t watch him it took so many years for them to find the right part and he was
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00016.flac	that's the the perfect part for him i'm hoping that the absc
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00017.flac	to make my own decisions that i never encouraged ever discouraged him and when asked why he he went in to business he used to hang around the the van di show
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00018.flac	yeah he he wanted to do some drama but he didhe probably has more piolots in the can than anyone except im
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00019.flac	absolutely yeah he's very persuasive and he's a strong when he goes in ad talk to the nedwork and because of his past successes
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00020.flac	they listen to what he says because his opinion is valuable and i i do't think we'd be gotten on the air without him and he's been instrumental in keeping us on the air he's a figure i hope you guys are
id10242_hoDLcSzy4dQ_00021.flac	no you've you've covered just about everybody that i can think of especially all the people that i admire
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00001.flac	well disney called me about the part oh  he was an old showe i very very nice everybody called him uncle walt and  i could see
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00002.flac	and i was he took me around and showed me the storyboaards the sherman brothers played me the score and i just
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00003.flac	it was my dream to do a walt disney movie of that kind you know a family movie for kids i was a
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00004.flac	well i had to donate four thousand dollars to his his art school
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00005.flac	e six weeks of very tough rehearsal on the on the backlot they built all those uh ruoftops out of plywood in ninety five degree
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00006.flac	si for weeks getting the dance numbers do that was my main wory oh well when i
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00007.flac	it was maintaining my amator standing an almost everything i do has met been a lot more
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00008.flac	tis lady most certainly but she's an mp under ne she's ah she's a practical joker she's  she likes to have her fun but uh easy to work with no i
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00010.flac	then but you as we do you know our show now one camera is bits and pieces from various parts nothing even follows so you can't really do a performance as such you're piecing together one it's more the editor's job than anyone and i never found doing movies that much fun cause if yo ever heard the list of
id10242_p66UVyJn8F8_00011.flac	the difference in mary poppins was doing musical numbers that's something else because you at least get to do a whole piece of
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00001.flac	um well i i think it was just that i got very attracted to the film because i heard that nick cornbe was writing aa
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00002.flac	that he ad wasn't developing from a book that he had already written i love his books um and i read this and immediately you're confronted with a u a very multiylayered um intriging well developed scriptd about with characters who you completely relate to and understand immediately which is very very rare but when you get such a talented writer as him
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00003.flac	does write such humorous rounded characters you're immediately compelled to to be to be part of it which i desperately
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00004.flac	was i loved her ideas for the piece and how uh sensitive to she was towards the era um how much she knew about england at that time and about the change that was about to dramatically sweep across the
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00005.flac	heartfelt story that i that i thought everyone would be able to relate to in a way i completely understood where the characters were coming from and the situations that they were in  the desperation to change um the rouot in which they were bound to be taking i i just think it has many human issues that we can all relate to
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00006.flac	for me things in films that make make make a film appealing if i can relate to it and believe it and understand it and feel moved by it then i'll care
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00007.flac	comes from a very privileged and wealthy upbringing i you know the moment i saw the appartment an this character and how
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00008.flac	you know he's got every sort of top of the range musical instrument he no dout can't play um all the latest art
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00009.flac	ht ware going on in the time he was a very well educated
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00010.flac	you get these costumes that you can that you can put on tha change the way you stand and the way you feel it's inhabiting the world in which my father you know where where my
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00011.flac	was like which ultimately sounded pretty depressing if you weren't living the lifestyle in which he
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00012.flac	um so then you question why why is this person who has all this stf
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00013.flac	and everything that you think you could possibly wan't whyis he still going around to old women'
id10247_Ck7SqFpM0DY_00014.flac	and we just got on immediately we were kind of and he's so and one of the reasons which i think the film works
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00001.flac	i don't know how what by no it doesn't help on any level wat d youmean if i'm out of an evening and i say i'm robert downa gn's father that
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00003.flac	well what i loved and i think it was totally inspired by the fact that jo our director came from that world
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00004.flac	of um invention and set designe um it was very specific and
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00005.flac	how we perceved the future in that era it couldn't be too futuristic but it was it was
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00006.flac	and it wasn't all green screen i think people often a under the misconception that we're just standing in a green box pretending that we're working with various bits of machinery or just sitting in a chair making it look as though we're flying a plane
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00007.flac	the truth is actually this was all pretty much built so to actually feel it and be a part of it and and see it helped tremendously
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00008.flac	a you every day in o of it the magnitude of it and how much thought had gone into it
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00009.flac	and it said a lot about the man himself i suppose this incredible unchprener
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00010.flac	great ideas which at the time would ave just been mind blowing um and i love all that i love to think how far aviation has come in such a short space of time
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00011.flac	taking of of the first plane to a plane that travels the speed of of a a of a bullet you know that we have actually done and that's not fantastical um yeah so it gives it gives some idea this playboy fun loving ladies man is actually also an incredible mathematician
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00012.flac	n a genius so having that being a part amongst that was really
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00013.flac	and that's what you do as a kid they're the worlds that you that you live in they're the they're the inventions that you make with your friends let's pretend we're doing this and suddenly you're you're doing it for real um you don't really know what to make of it i don't know what to make of it
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00014.flac	you kindo in a way icertainly the devil's douvile we stayed away from that because we didn't want it to be a a an acurate historical biographical detailed account of those events therefore you have dramatic license as with this this is it's a comic book so you can talk about it in that way if if you want to but yeah and they're all
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00015.flac	hung up and worried about those issues um you know why
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00016.flac	stark industries itself is creating you know whatw's it creating was it there to create weapons no it was create creating thes to protect and to save and to help
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00017.flac	thn it was from shooting the devil's double which was very small and and playing two parts in it and feeling  very much at the center of
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00018.flac	the creativity of it and and and and the ability to believe that you had a say and that you could change how it was being shot or how you thought this character
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00019.flac	should should be because you're completely inhabiting it when when you're doing such a vast um scale movie uas the the marvel comics you'd be um where you could  not be there for three weeks at the beginning of shooting and then you'd be there to come on and suddenly starts throwing your waight around and deciding how you thingk things should
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00020.flac	is in a way harder to suddenly come on board something and and believe strongly in what you've already created and ou'r ideas behind this the character of howard stark and and and suddenly you're you're you're showing it to people and you're on a set in a in a massive arena and and it can be very nerve
id10247_IvZUrnqKZsA_00021.flac	have to just i suppose believe that if if you don't like it you don't like it but this is what this is what i've gotten
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00001.flac	scan because his father um very much helped him get back on the throne and they sneaked  charls out of england but when uh cromwell was trying to find him and behead him and they
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00002.flac	trol again and he he reopened all the theaters charles second and made made england fun again and and rochester was kind of the at the helm of that in his
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00003.flac	u excess and and the fact that he had such a close relationship with the monarchy and with with king charles the second he always completely pushed everything to the to the limit um he was a very uh extraordinarily
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00004.flac	mand gr  certainly thinks so and and it wul but but i supposed in the way that he tor he was writing poetry and pieces of work and
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00005.flac	and how they were thinking which at the time i think was very suppressed so for that reason yes but on the other hand also appalling in his in his um i
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00007.flac	um there's dances and routines and it it becomes very sexual in parts of it but then it becomes very darkthe latter end of his life is
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00008.flac	is of that i suppose and we see uh we see this one uh he the king commissions him to write something gives him a chance to show show his true talents and he comes up with this his one play that he wrote was extraordinarily um
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00009.flac	if i' met him you wouldn't like i think i'd be very tough i think i've bein i
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00011.flac	it i always knew from the moment tha i read it that it should be something very special and i think it i it's somethingthat i would love to watch and i loe
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00012.flac	because i'd heard so little about it and i didn't really know about the comics and uh i needed someone to explain to me how they were gonna turn adapt this and turn it into a series cause i had no idea i was like i can understand the concept behind it but how are you
id10247_kKhcmBH8c4w_00013.flac	but the'se such lovely guys seth was there with his producing partner and with the show rond the guy writing a they ere about four or five of them big

id10248_PoblrgFCN_A_00014.flac	daughtes of all time and nobody can replace him and i'm not a shining example i don't have to but i must say
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00001.flac	o it was all i wanted to be that was it that was my dream i dreamed about getting the
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00002.flac	and i heard the laughs and that hooked me that was it i heard that response
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00003.flac	well i was the understudy to the lead angeo and i had a small role
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00004.flac	um kind ofan aby like character and that sshe is not al together honest
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00005.flac	but you know this is based on a real woman this is a true story that she coned all these people out of their money she kind this guy into marrying
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00006.flac	is that i have  i'm engaged to this other guy but i've met this new guy who's who is really hot and i'm gonna go off with him and i've taken all the other
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00007.flac	i said let's go off together and i call thim to the hotel room one night and i've got all the money
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00008.flac	york right out to californias to be an a major emotion picture with one of the biggest stars in the world so i was like wo
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00009.flac	um but he was great t that was the first uh movie that he directed also and uh he was a wonderful director even then he's gotten better and better
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00010.flac	and he was a wonderful guy to work with i i sound uh like really uh oring here but
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00011.flac	he's not uh uh i mean he everything is very loose and and he doesn't rehearse a lot and he just kind of films it and and it kinda happens his preparations very good though but when you're there
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00012.flac	really i know it's a great film it's just the to see myself back then to see that shag haircut and those hot pants and
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00013.flac	she's different uh it's just every day is something knew something i probably she's more she has more of her own personality than i thought she would i mean it just blossoms every day she's willful and she's strong and she's sweet and uh she's
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00014.flac	everywhere i go they ask me that people seem to be really interested they are talking about it they've called me and i guess many of the other cast members and asked if we would do it i said ure i think it'ld be great fun i think they're looking for a writer now and i think itit'll be either a four hour minni series or four one hour shows
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00015.flac	as i would 'ave liked him to be mostly in foring policy but as far as this country goes in what he's done and the kind of programs that he's tried to um toyeah the economy's better than it has been in a very long time the deficit is being
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00016.flac	i just think he's he's terific and he really feels for people out there he has a heart that feels for the
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00017.flac	where i can figure whether or not he could run a country i don't know i don't think we know his position on many many things yet uh when we find out his position you know everybody's gonna go every which way it's gonna start to be well i don't agree with that and i don't agree with that i don't know if somebody who is not a politician can go into washington and work with the congress and run
id10252_L4AUu_lRWYc_00018.flac	the country i think the country is set up to be run by politicians and i don't think somebody else
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00001.flac	i've had two really long relationships in my life which i feel were like marriages um i just never felt
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00002.flac	i also have a a security that i find iin something other than
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00003.flac	ono i mean i think there is for certain women their destiny is to to reproduce to have children to to bring up children that's a a valed and and magnificent thing to do i don't think it is right for everyone or at certain times
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00004.flac	after the role the the producers knew me and they said oh yes yes of course we'll
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00005.flac	oh that's not good enough they'll say now she's too soft she's doesn't have the edge and i insisted that they let me come in and read which i did and
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00006.flac	a lot of times and so she she was mt much more real than the average vicxon
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00007.flac	you don't spend that much of your time doing it even when you're filming i mean you might be there for twelve hours but you're not in front of the camera all that time so that i need other things to challenge me to to keep me excited and i found producing is in developing material and
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00008.flac	was really exciting for me and i found some very good projects and i'm really
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00009.flac	it makes people laugh i i love the title and uh i'm gonna start that may
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00010.flac	uh i've got another one called runaway father that i've been working on for about two years we've been trying to get that script right and i'm real excited about that true story of a woman by the name of pat bennet who is
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00011.flac	ot a miney series called pride of royals i've got uh one called west end another one called riverside
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00012.flac	realistate yes stock kno uh i'm very conservative
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00013.flac	countant but i signe all my own checks i oversee everything i i knew some people got real burned by letting other people signe their
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00014.flac	isn't too overdone you know you wanna i think there's certain times you wanna look made up particularly in the evening and stuff but but in the daytime that's the time to really watch out that you're not wearing too much makeup cause it
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00015.flac	to some extent getting older but it happens to be a fact and the alternative isn't so good so
id10252_ti9CQnn5aZw_00016.flac	um but it's not so much a fear of losing the beauty because there's a lots a lot of other
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00001.flac	though even though she does a lot of sort of noughty things she uh
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00002.flac	she has her own reasons she has her own sort of morality she's not evil though she 'uld never do well she wouldn't kill anyone
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00003.flac	birth and they wanted abby to have done it and i uh i said no abbiy wouldn't do that she's a mother and uh and uh she couldn't do that to another
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00004.flac	like the way she goes about things sometimes because she never sort of cries on anyone else's shoulder if something happens and
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00005.flac	long time and i really got to a point after a while where i said i don't i don't wanna play that anymore because ii it's huarting my psychey
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00007.flac	there's there's the good guys ind the bad guys for the most part although ou our show i think we have more three dmentional characters than
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00008.flac	ohhe's wonderful we have a lot of wonderful actors on our show a new actor who's coming on this
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00009.flac	but you know when you play a character for this length of time um a lot of you hase to go into the character n and the character can can rub off on you to anin some
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00010.flac	no but i feel like i've gained a lot of confidence from her because she has a lot of confidence i feel
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00011.flac	hher ambitionsort of has rubed off on me to some extent and i don't think that's a bad thing uh i've tried not i'
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00012.flac	i have a morality that's there eno matter who i play or what i do  that's there and that's my co
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00013.flac	no i mean i i do have good women friends um a lot of women friends as a matter of fact i didn't use to i didn't use to seek the company of women very
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00014.flac	tolike the company of women very much and now i do i find lots of very fun bright
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00015.flac	yes it is as a matter of fact it keeps selling h it's been out for uh close to a year now and uh it just keeps selling people seem to like it and and when they find it
id10252_wvjrGCX6zfg_00016.flac	well she does meet up again with the first love
id10256_A3IfNNgTkuY_00001.flac	pretty much all the sets to scale that was so impressive and also working with a ah director as intense and as talented as down
id10256_A3IfNNgTkuY_00002.flac	asyes i think it's incredible it's very rar for a studio to put up so much money um for a story like this and it's and also to trust
id10256_A3IfNNgTkuY_00003.flac	not a pit's not a popconflict although it's extreemely entertaining but you come you come out of the theater like
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00001.flac	theyou know i had seen bits of that but i didn't ne didn't really visit it specially for the project and i had read the book of course i was sort of made to read it at school and i i
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00002.flac	it's hard to think about bringing something new that always that would just scare you i think all you have to do is look at the material and bring something
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00003.flac	fresh in the sense that you just react to it i mean when you're put in a  room with actors you're just gonna reacto them and you're gonna bring something completely new anyway cause you're not gonna have the same
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00004.flac	you know e no one's gonat live the lines the same way it's completely differen rduction design completely different team so i don't think i have to worry about anything being new i just have to live in the moment and let things kinnetically be created as as it happens
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00005.flac	i mean it's  such a help i mean you just walk into these worlds and they're created for you so it's such a blessing and i think it's it's one of the first jrobs i've walked on o the sets every day and just been like
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00006.flac	my god i mean you think how much money mus they spent on this but think it's just the pure work the bbc just put they they we they soths ty have such a love for what they do and they worke with such great
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00007.flac	i mean i mean yeah those those costumes in those days were a little but uncomfortable and it was
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00008.flac	worked with the same costume designer worked with hnm whre i got the boy uh job a done before and she wana bafta for that and she's just sso brilliant um that i was i mean i was just thrilled to be able to work with her gan she's just
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00009.flac	yeah yeah i spent loads of time lod of time cause kids can only film for like four hours at a time or a day or something so i'd sometimes have to come in on the days and and film for the rest of the day so we spend a lot of time together and he's a really really cool kid really cool kid anisy who plays the the youngest
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00010.flac	i don't know he sees something he sees something and i think she's not not a nice person she's just
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00011.flac	she's damage s isn't she i mean it's not her it's mishavisham i think always think that if you if you have a kid
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00012.flac	um they can turn out horrible not thathe stel turns out horrible at all but you can have smeoe that turns out horrible but if you put them ina different porrental home they would turn oto
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00013.flac	b different i suppose um but he sees something he falls in love with her sometimes you can't explain it and he i think itsone of h ost amazing things and  amazing thing about this love storyes he just never gives up on her not once e
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00014.flac	itstill completely reliyou know relevant today and um his characters are so brilliant that people just want want
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00015.flac	to read about it or watch it on screen and um yeah i think that's why people people love him they're just so the novels are so rich and full of life
id10256_dAKwGq-PQqU_00016.flac	costumes the the stories the the scale of it is just very it's kind of it's very
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00001.flac	just two young people h no different if ther were wo young people today two young people in this situation going through these things going through you know h the initial you know the realization of what love feels like ananthe sort of how blinded you
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00002.flac	and uh so for for me it was just about going back to to basics and thinking about two young people being put into
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00003.flac	just you're totally lost and blinded by this this this sort of thing you know chemicals are literally just thatyo've never experienced before  strting to flow around your body and you have to youhave to try and remember what that's like to sort of be to get totally lost
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00004.flac	you are from your physical appearance to your everything every fiber of your being this also i mean you know i've been a young guy that's been in love before maybe not to these
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00005.flac	these feelings and emotions we have soyu have to go and tapp into that and create the
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00006.flac	i mean all his themes are still so relevant today i mean this story i mean you can go anywhere in the world and find young people that are in love but can't be together because of you know social conflicts or gang conflicts or you know arranged marriages around the world you know this i think and and also on more of a a on a on a smaller scale you know just teens being in love for the first time and
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00007.flac	like tak you know tak any box psa but uh i think a especillyas british actors
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00008.flac	are drawn to it because it's something that we've grown up with and it's
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00009.flac	hyes this has totally opened my eyes even firther i mean i enjoyed shakespeare before but not until i truly invested in this and fell in love with thesda i actually
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00010.flac	fall in love with this story and also his work in in general i mean i went to see athello the other day at the natonal theatr and i'v i've seen it before but since doing this movie i i brought a whole new level of
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00011.flac	and um you know we got to do the horce training the dance training and i did the source the sord
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00012.flac	been blessed so far in my career to be to work with the people i have you know uh sort of dame an pu and this movie stelan and then
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00013.flac	like actors that i mean i grew up watching gladyate andtha wsone of the things that inspired me to act is working you know is is watching russel
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00014.flac	o messin glediator and to work with him playing my father in the move that i did after this one a so speciall there there are plenty of pinch yourself moments where you have to go i'm doing what i have dreampt of doing all my life and doing what i love with the people iyou know respect and admire so if i could be half the actors tha half the actor that any of those are by the time i'm there
id10256_iy8TtnhkE4o_00015.flac	keep on making things as well but it's uh yeah it's a it's a big time for me but i just you know trying to take it in my
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00001.flac	tical you know an's abvios done a great job with the the whole look of the film and his investment of his own
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00002.flac	guys really have juristiction over the whole world to try and
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00003.flac	in tandem with local police forces from whatever country their fugitive happens to reside in and so they have cart blanch really to to go anywhere in the world in order to track down whoever itis
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00004.flac	and you know he's been tracking this this particular guy for many years and he
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00005.flac	to make sense of his own life to um in somehow in some way feel that he's achieve
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00006.flac	role of uas an interpol agent as a police officer as the man in in the eyes of the world who
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00007.flac	yu know clean up the the nastier elements of our society he has to you know achieve his go which is to track him down so it's not easy for
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00008.flac	you know what theever the rights and wrongs of that are from his point of view i are the tryminal e elements that he's killing anyways
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00009.flac	to someone from interple the fact is he's a murderer and he creates mahim wherever he goes and he has to be
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00010.flac	i mean the movie's great so hopefully the people who are uh finds of the movie the the vido game
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00011.flac	well i mean it's not a world that i am familiar with uh in my own life but i
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00012.flac	there are there is that element in eastern urop in russa and in other eastern uropian countries you know after the fall of the iand
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00013.flac	i mean in terms of you know in this space that normal people ar whatever normal person is occupyin and
id10257_K15lRgcitSw_00014.flac	there's certainly an awerness of an eastern european uh mafhe element um being presant in in britan along with many other people as well but certainly in the last ten
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00001.flac	you know a a an important relationship with my own father and having two sons now um one who's eighteen and one who's twenty three months twenty two months and the music of the classh was such an important part of musical history  in this country and in the world
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00002.flac	anger and such hope and such optimism and and questioning questioning all the time about what our society was about and what it was doing for the young people at that time and uh and great britain in nineteen seventy eight seventy nine you know just seventy eight was the year before thatcher came to power and we're about to have all those years of of
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00003.flac	and of she was the most polerizing prime minister that i can think of and and
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00004.flac	ily that that that was around when i've been you know alive
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00005.flac	and tacer was not a popular prem minister where i was brought up and i was broughp in a very industrial earea in fife in scotland
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00006.flac	i think that the clash and jo strumer you know where a sort of a a
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00007.flac	neck who's dano's father and uh we we you know he's a single dad and he lived in the suburbs of london and he and he's exstranged from his his his ex wife who went off to live in a sort of hippy commune an
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00008.flac	he was a uh you know in a rock band himself but he gave up his dreams of being a rock star in order to get you know a job that could pay the rent to bring up his two kids so
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00009.flac	opens a music shop he tunes pianos and he sells pianos and musical instruments and he also you know drives a taxi so he gets into a really bad accident and he can't work so his son decides to pretend to be you know to to be a woman and drive a taxe uh and he meets jo strumer
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00010.flac	really sort of claiming his identity about what it is to be a a a young man in london and and all that comes with and when he hears the
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00011.flac	i love johny for i've known johny for a long long time and uh i think he's unikue as an actor i think he's
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00012.flac	he's just such a you' love watching him on the screen and he's got a great i'd say very unique uh energy to him and and he's  he's a very
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00013.flac	po of of the film industory and you know cause i've done a lot of movies in my time and the london film festival is a great film festival and i'm glad that i'm part of it uh in some way you know i've had quite a few movies over the years of the london film festivals and it'savl and it's a wonderful festival and i think long ma it continue
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00014.flac	not not a bad thing it's just the way it is it's slightly been overshadowed by the the rise of the new television industry which you know was kindaf started by netflixs and uh
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00015.flac	series of um snatch at the moment the tv version of the movie so i'm doing that ma filming i managed to sat in london i'm playing on eastend gangster  oofa
id10257_Ko-rW5RWuOo_00016.flac	different characters and similar characters but a different story and some of those stories and it's kind of inspired by but different
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00001.flac	you know which hadn't happened it n an extraordinary opportunity from the character of
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00002.flac	back in time and and meets her her other her younger self and tries to stear her in a different direction from the direction that she herself took which lead to obviously not a very happy ending so it's a it's about her relationship with um lodwic gerol who i play who
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00003.flac	to u to spend your life with but that's what she did so you know and and men like that are are are are often incredibly attractive to women and  no matter how many times you know things go wrong in the relationship women always keep coming back because he has this kind of charm and this whold over them so he's you know he's he's one of those people who see's an opportunity and exploits it
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00004.flac	an o his own history obviously has contributed to the way that he's turned out in life and and the choices that he makes you know and i feel for that i understand that you know because he's a survivor you know the way in order to survive in this life one has to some people have to you know resort to those kind of tactics in order to get by
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00005.flac	to yourself first you know cause i'm playing them uh and so my history obviously can for any character that i play youu know what i've done in my life and choices that i've made uh experiences i've had
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00006.flac	uh emotional circumstances i've gone through so one looks to that first of all and then you know one reads other people's stories you know i read chek baker and that was an extraordinary story you know his life was tragic and
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00007.flac	you know listen to his music charlie parker  you know whole whost of musicias they have the same
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00008.flac	from everywhere ultimately you bring it back to yourself ah that's applicable
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00009.flac	idon' know what the message of the film  i mean i think it's a great story uh first an foremost
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00010.flac	and i think everyone wll takes something different from it you know hopefully women kind get inspired o causei
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00011.flac	we can't go back in time and change things it's really a
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00012.flac	encouraging people to to try and make the right choices and not to make the choices that are goin na
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00013.flac	will do but you know you make your bead you have to ly n it sometimes on
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00014.flac	i  you know i i'm i'm happy with the choices that i made you know and uh you know i have to to to live with that and you know an
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00015.flac	you know can can be quite distructive in itself so uh you know we
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00016.flac	both happy ith what you've goght and yoou know what was at my dad said to me he said definition ta happy uh of success is how happy
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00017.flac	come to and get get help and and make abbucive women uh
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00018.flac	you know come an out into the public ey so that it's uh it's not pushed under
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00019.flac	i think it's really important that women have an organization where they can turn to when things do get
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00020.flac	thouh which women can come to and get get help and and make abusive women
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00021.flac	action that they wish to take you know it's a terrible thing you know and the women live with it every day and a lot of silent uh women
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00022.flac	abou ta find themselves an impossible situations uh and hope
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00023.flac	i um i di a couple of few movies last year that are gonna come out
id10257_fI-1LgrsNNE_00024.flac	teronto for six months im shooting ah uh a cable american cable show called um hemlock grove setin
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00001.flac	s my name yes and and stil is my name when i'm in ireland and when i went to
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00002.flac	wilson in equity at the time and so i had to change it so i picked shu who was the great
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00003.flac	brought up on my parents happly but i did go daily to uh a convent untill i was about eight or nine and then
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00004.flac	and i've done it very many times actually ad i could do it for you now but it would take up more than five minutes it would take thirty eight
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00005.flac	in that instance actually we were asked to do it for a festival and in in uh brussels so we took a house
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00006.flac	in different rooms of the house so i began to associate the poim with domestic realities rather than
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00007.flac	an fantastic time uh  i mean it's great fun to have maybe two actors who normally do big classical roles to do big classical funny roles because you're freed from the kind of constraints of very very good language or the harnessing of incredibly dexterous difficult thinking or elaborate thinking and suddenly you're just trying to make nonsense funny and uh by doing that
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00008.flac	and in my case i mean i i think i act as if the wheels are going to come off at any moment and
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00009.flac	h it's very hard to you know you can't be sure of this chemistry and i think it gets very sentimental if you start saying there's great chemistry between us so simon an
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00010.flac	bt with a good friend and not much upstagees that so i'm not there to bor anybody i really think if you're not going to have dinner i've got to give you an exciting evening so i think the
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00011.flac	weep a lot i don't think i am but i think i am excitable and my mother is i've
id10317_CRP3XtjNdeE_00012.flac	she famously saiys she is bored but i played bordam through somebody who was terribly ankious and kept moving the furniture around so her bordom came out ans
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00001.flac	this is about a monstrous act isn't it by a very unmonstrous person and i suspect most monstrous acts are done by very unmonstrous people and i think that's the
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00002.flac	sharp morality of the play that i it makes you look at the fact that we make monsters out of people but actually people are just
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00003.flac	during the theater course is a story of imagination and the problem about people in life is it maybe a story of psychology or psychosis i don't think madeais about psychosis it maybe that the the people that we read or hear about in the news are actually in medical or psychological difficulty madea
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00004.flac	it's just in emotional difficulty that's the really horrible truth of it that she's not mad she does something so beyond rational and suitability that you might think she might be mad but that's a sort of copp out the worrying fact is that she's not mad that just within sanity she does this terrible thing and i think king leer is the same you know hamelet's the same these people aren't mad they're just in
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00005.flac	there had been when we were in ireland there had been a uh a case of a woman who had driven her car right up to a cliff to see that the tide was out with her children in it and therefore backed the car out again and went to another place i mean there people people become incredibly precise at these moments of suicidor murder of their children an because the thing is gruw somely pragmatic often and so there's there was endless incidents in the paper of of things that we looked at
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00006.flac	in the end has to do it i don't think she she tries not to do it i mean that's the it's about somebody trying not to kil

id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00018.flac	shout all you can that's all you can do i mean they people just are screaming at each other the stuff that you hear in the street when people are arguing so it is it's it's a fatasty pla cause by the time we are half way through it's only forty minutes into it and i can't believe how much we've got through already and then there's the the
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00019.flac	and then you realize you're in the wrong play and you're trying t hers the right play i think you if you take the time you can go up on these little avenues that are entirely wrong i i'm i'm very good at doing the wong

id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00022.flac	pombum has already existed before the before we the curtain opens and so a lot of what we have to do is our preparation is quite thoro so we do meet for an hour before
id10317_SaqG27Uwf28_00023.flac	communicates with i think literally physical energy just the physical energy of the actors carrying the weight of that terrible story that just sits behind their heads if you don't bring that with you the

id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00002.flac	you know that was one of the big stops you made was in huston at the shamerock hotel and uh my agent called and

id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00004.flac	so he said well they promise they'll get you on the plane so i go down parmount studios and i meet people that i had no idea who they were but surewood
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00005.flac	who created the brady bunch john rich one of the most known directors ind television dug cramer
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00006.flac	uh they were all these people sitting there and so they met me and they said well would you mind uh coming back later
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00007.flac	fine come back and um where of the star trek set
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00008.flac	and they made me up in the star trek dressing room william shatner was in there not overly friendly i might ad which i have razed him about many times over the years but um they made me up i went back and did a a screen test not with robert reed with another actor
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00009.flac	they thanked me very much i got on my plane got to houston later that night the next day rehearsed getting ready to go on stage for the first
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00010.flac	oh my gosh well i went to the gentleman who ran the
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00011.flac	the uh room at the hotel and i explained what the deal was and i said if this show becomes a hit
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00012.flac	and make up this engagement so they let me out they got another entertainer i believe jerry vale came and filled in for me and um i went back did the pilot thought no more of it
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00013.flac	didn't know there were people in the audience that were thinking about me for a role in the song of norway
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00014.flac	so wound up going to london shortly after that and doing the screen test for the song of norway to play edvard grieg's wife nina
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00015.flac	loant behold i got that so i'm over in norway which is something that was supposed to take a few weeks goes into months now the bready bunch has been picked up and they're getting ready to start the brady bunch they're screaming for me you know to leave the movie and it was really a chaotic time and i had to fly back go right to la and they had already shot around me for six episodes and so i had to catch up i was meeting myself coming and going
id10318_5UAgM2vmJjc_00016.flac	and um the rest ofs tv history i don't quite understand it
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00001.flac	uh the cast which was the same on the pilot
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00002.flac	i think sherwoods spent hours and hours and hours and saw hundreds of kids for these roles i think one that that made it early was susan ulson
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00003.flac	but i think they saw hundreds and hundreds of kids and my goodness what a stroke of luck that they wound up with those
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00004.flac	kids because i think another reason why this show has lasted it was that initial chemistry of bob
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00005.flac	and uh and everybody on that set was a pro from the beginning well sure wich forats could tell you cause i think he saw them all but he
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00006.flac	you know so close to them he had such definite ideas about what they should do or shouldn't do and i think as they grew and they developed very definite ideas of their own i think sometimes that was very hard for
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00007.flac	we had spent time uh together doing the pilot i think about two weeks as i recall and we kind of got to know each other then when i came back they they already had us had a head start on me but i think it was just
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00008.flac	the idea that it worked in the pilot and it and it worked and we knew it worked
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00009.flac	i think professionally we respected each other and it just kind of it kind of took off but as far as as having extra time we didn't we didn't have that luxury so we had to kind of do it as we were going along you know it was at work in progress and it was the time that we spent trying to rehearse a scene or preparing or having lunch together or
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00010.flac	ould come over to my house or my kids would go to their houses those kinds of things that built up
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00011.flac	dn't know any of them before shooting began i certainly knew of anby davise's work and robert reed but i had never worked with anyone that um
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00013.flac	knowing in the beginning their real names and their stations and i think someone told me this that in one of the episodes i think i call chris night peter i
id10318_Ty-Bl6STB1Y_00014.flac	i mean i call him chris um i think it was i think it was uh chris night but yeah that was hard just learning everybody's
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00001.flac	i think one of the most talented people that i've ever worked
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00002.flac	um when i first did the show they said oh well you know he doesn't like to rehearse he he he won't be there um you know kind of off the cuff but the more i did the show the more i realized even though he didn't come to rehearsal he knew
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00003.flac	that was going on they made tapes for him of things um and you know you'd be singing a duet with him and you wouldn't see him  till the day of the show but i realized just how how brilliant he was and what a great comedian he was and is still one of the high lights of my career i think lena horne um kate smith and myself were his
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00004.flac	but i just and again i mean choreographers like bob sidney
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00005.flac	you know who's done so much television and so much incredible work as a choreographer you'd have all these incredible dancers and people to help you create these numbers and and do all of these incredible things and um greg garrison was the director very tough
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00006.flac	um but he was always very nice to me as a matter of fact they built this huge number around me for one of the shows and kate smith was on the show
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00007.flac	she said to to greg garrison uh she said how long have you um known florence
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00008.flac	you know uh i knew of her work and and but this is really the first time that that i've worked with her and kate smith said well then how come she has all those chandeleers in her
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00010.flac	to look down the back of her gown and she wold weare these huge gown you know she was a big woman with this incredibly wonderful voice and
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00011.flac	lookd down the back of her dress he said you read the label it says everlast and and he was just always going on with with stick you know but he would he would never hit you over the head with it and i don't know ii loved working with him because
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00012.flac	he would do spontaneious things and he loved if you were able to go with him
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00013.flac	i thought he was always incredibly well prepared and he knew how much i like to rehearse i'm a rehearsal freak and um he gave me a picture of the two of us together
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00014.flac	don't practice too much and he once said to me di thought this was an interesting comment about television
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00015.flac	television yyou don't wanna practice too much because then you might get
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00016.flac	and i thought that was very interesting because what he was saying really was don't be afraid to make a mistake don't be afraid to be
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00017.flac	and i think that's kind of good advice for for television unless you're doing news or historical things you know biographies whatever
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00018.flac	but dean martin was such a high light to me dean would come in the day of the show and
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00019.flac	you kind a go through things just kinda marking it and then you'd have a dress rehearsal which they film and gre gerson would always stand in for
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00020.flac	you know so that i guess he would translate to deane what was upposed to be done and
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00021.flac	you'd have a great dress rehearsal sometimes they were almost better and they would always film those in case they i guess they wanted to edit go back and forth and then you would do the actual
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00022.flac	uh once i i broke a bone on my foot i was doing a backflip off a guy's back one of the dancers and landed real hard on my foot and uh my foot all swelled up and during the number i was doing with dean my sho popped off that's how swolen my foot became and somehow he he took a step and we wound up on the floor it was like a double pratfall both laughing histerically turned out to be incredibly
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00023.flac	and i think it's still on the table he said oh poor
id10318_hqXyZ37UvW8_00024.flac	got a a broken toe or something like that but those were moments you know when you worked with somebody like dean martain
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00001.flac	uh i think ever since i was eighteen i used to i mean when we were filming troy we were um we were filming down in cabo mexico for u about two or three months of it and they had this one karoke joint called what's up kareoke and a bunch of the cast would go down there every single night to um to
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00002.flac	and and it was basically so repetitive everybody sang the sangs the same songs every night and yeah mine was always like better man by prl jam or sommy budy was always
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00003.flac	for a real audience and um i man um well troy was my first um acting gig you know in terms of really performing for for an audience for was really
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00004.flac	country strong i mean we'd have five hundred to a thousand people in the audiences there and and that was that was kindof the the the the first of that besides you know you're your late night crew at some
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00005.flac	um um do you know uh family helps
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00006.flac	and and so that really helps because when you go home at the end of the day or you're on the phone with them nothing you know it's interesting
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00008.flac	you know um meexpressing my excitement from where i've come and and where i'm going and and you realize that it's it's important to you but it's it's not everybody else's first and foremost priority and so having a grounded family helps you remain grounded uh
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00009.flac	that's that's a good help good friends to to keep you in check stuff like
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00010.flac	um working with tim was definitely i've worked with him like three times now i mean h inbetween friday night lights country strong and and you know our infamous truck yeah video
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00011.flac	n tat uh with him and i wheeling around the trucks but it's it's funny i was telling somebody thes story the other day just kinda uh you know looking back o on the past and and and
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00012.flac	how you know uh i was the biggest fan of tin and and how we've come to work with each other so many times and how great our kind of friendship is i think in terms of
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00013.flac	tuf are just so talented and i've got to meet them through this process and the the concert that we had in new york where it was like uh jack white and
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00014.flac	and folks like that all came down uh conoberst uh ascar performed um this film has uh
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00015.flac	terms of the musical company that that the coans have put together as well as as tebon so it
id10325_7u-rskIpVxE_00016.flac	um  wonderful book called unbroken that that i'm i'm sure many people are a fan of so um i hope it's wonderful and as inspiring as the o
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00001.flac	that if he's gonna help hook get off this iland and fly him to home  home to which he can't remember that he must help peter find his mother and and hook agrees to this but in no way really
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00002.flac	ship he is selfish sort of exterior comes out uh full fleshed and and you reallyse
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00003.flac	you really see is true colars but then there are tid bits and and also the interesting bit is about this film is the original j
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00004.flac	one little line that said hook learned his ways from blackbeard and so we
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00005.flac	moments tried to ad little blackbeardisms into it knowing that i mean obviously this was a young
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00006.flac	ok that that sort of was having a buddin relationship with tiger lelly and was having this kind of back and forth kinship with peter was slowly sort of showing
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00007.flac	us this um much more you know black beardean venvillenus side
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00008.flac	from the moment i met him has been swooning every
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00009.flac	and younger girls hearts that i've ever hseen him encounter um
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00010.flac	um he's the most charming young boy i've ever met uh he really is peter pan in a way i mean altoughe's not quite as selfish as peter pan's depicted to be in in a lot of the versions he
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00011.flac	he's brilliant actor and what he did with this film is brilliant and how he holds himself as brilliant and how he handles these presse junkets is brilliant and and i think i've learned half my
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00012.flac	and flamboyant and over the top and when joe asked me to do this he'd said you know imagine that neverland is just a figment of a child's imagination so there are no rules and
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00013.flac	um and surprise us and the more we
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00014.flac	we were having and the more fun joke was having and especially with these sets being so massive and i think
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00015.flac	the neverlanforist set was the one of the biggest sets the uka had ever built
id10325_tLjSkUfuov8_00016.flac	and it would be two hundred extraus dress as natives and it'd be you know two hundred cast members and a ugndan children's cir and lev as an eleven year old wide ied first experience like this um dancing around on these sets because jow'd be playing music and everybody's acting childish and ridiculous and we realized that every every film should really
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00001.flac	po duu camp which um which laid out their their whole
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00002.flac	it's in and their uh experience of punishment and sort of everything and uh laura hillen brand had sent this diary over to me which
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00003.flac	of years before um um uh we found ourselves on set making this movie uh
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00004.flac	so from from years and years of watching everything i could online or reading every story that h'd been written about him the day uh when it came to the day that i was to arive at his house
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00005.flac	angee told me to not come empty handed so i went sop and i brought this box of
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00006.flac	me it that seem like the sort of traditional thing that that my
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00007.flac	it um and and so  sitting there yeah it's um it was very sreal but
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00008.flac	some of the stuff on the raft first you may see it it stu
id10325_wCYGls_Gib8_00009.flac	uh trying to skype with my family saying happy turky day whille he got

id10326_uCm1c-EyrPU_00017.flac	didn't look like mary telermore or all the pretty girls on tv they werea somebody who looked like a regular person and these two my sister looks like a regular person talks like a regular person and cindy willams was
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00001.flac	pos my opinion as the hardest job in the world is a mother razing a teenage o these days it's a toughy with that internet
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00002.flac	look up it's a majur thing i have granchildren they look up occasionally if there's ice cream they look up but i i think it was time to celebrate it and not so much oh i'll do another holiday as uh do something about mothers and how hard it is and how they have to put up with
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00003.flac	tha make them happy and she said that when i was six
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00004.flac	i don't be borri i think at seven or eight i said i don't know i what is
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00005.flac	i knew my father wasn't boring but was not so funny my father but he was a great bas and that's truly why penny ronny and i all up
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00006.flac	well i try to convey that i will not really win you an academy award but i will make you have a really good time doing the movie and you'll make friends
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00007.flac	you'll uh it'll be a different experience and they come because they like to do once in a while something that's a different thing than the usual movie and i won't blow them up i won't make them fly they don't have to do green screen they'll actually be another actor talking to them
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00008.flac	because my rules you must do off camera for each other and they all do and uh they i hope
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00009.flac	is because they have a good time most of them had said hat uh
id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00010.flac	pot of shobis s he went in cause i lectured it north wester but she was so uh nice

id10326_xrWQUOz2mOo_00013.flac	sister everybody knows my sister penny but i said i had the best time with jennifer she was so good and made the scenes come alive because she has a way of doing it not like u female male or anything just like

id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00004.flac	and it was exciting you know i don't think he uh he grasped the significance of it but um he was more insent in the carats but i i i i
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00005.flac	fifteen years and uh my mother is very active in the actrin woman's city club she's the

id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00007.flac	oh god now u you know we're always asking some of the the greatest ones always esscape you at the
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00008.flac	i would say most of the joking around on the set involved um quips
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00009.flac	we're making we're making fun of the scene before we do it because it just sort of breaks the tention and we do all sorts of things
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00010.flac	with each other's off the set as well i don't know i mean they're
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00011.flac	uh i think we should just sort of keep to ourselves but believe me trust me they're funny they were very
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00012.flac	uh we went actually we went both to the stow on and to the original
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00013.flac	trip uh no thatt's great i i didn't make it to skyway which is that's another favorite during the those high school years that was one of my favorites and i didn't make it to stodard's frozen custared which i don't even know if that's
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00014.flac	she was a great influence in my life hshe proly doesn't know this but she actually was somebody who trusted me a great deal i she used to read to
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00015.flac	person called puppy and uh i was mesmorized by the story and i just couldn't wait to hear it the next day and she let me take
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00016.flac	home over night which was a complete secret no one else wasyou
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00017.flac	granted this privilege and i was so nervous about losing the book but she she really trusted me uh which which probably took a lot of courage on her part and uh uh i just remember how terrific i thought she was and she was the one that uh hthat
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00018.flac	i told her i'd danced in a beard joint and one five bucks which uh actually was true but it wasn't quite
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00019.flac	i had one you know five or seven dollars or something doing a tap dance and singing a song
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00020.flac	i don't know if se'l be back again i don't know if anything's happening this year again  not not to my nowlege but
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00021.flac	continues our relationship we we haven't had as many scenes as we would like together in that way so we're hoping that there's some episode this year that will happen well um we both have requested that
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00022.flac	ap dancing when i was four or five and 've done it for a long time i love it brent could do a few steps on his own and so i knew what those steps were and tried to corograph in a way that would uh
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00023.flac	sort of work those steps into it and then we also had a a a double at at another point um it was a lot of fun and we got to work on the scene together and and sort of play around with some of the the lines and the comic timing it was a
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00024.flac	and in certain ways i'm sure it will change and i'm i'm sure he would have wanted that if he were still at the helm it would change ana
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00025.flac	oh no i i i love i do love watching the medical stuff because it's
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00026.flac	you know he when when uh we've had a few opportunities to spend a little time together doforist and
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00027.flac	are so they're much smaller and therere there're less of them therere so many props now in the in heh bevrili's medical thai love you've seein the difference of the
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00028.flac	wondered about that nobody has ever you know allowed me to pin them down but i've always thought so i think
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00029.flac	so much fun working with somebody who already knows all of our idieo sincracyes and and we're just very comfortable with him
id10329_EXBuk_FwHu0_00030.flac	if you're familiar with the sets as we all are if we're on them every day it helps to come up with your ideas of how you're gonna shoot something and it went very
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00001.flac	and and i don't remember it at all um until sort of when it was reruns and things like that and i knew the show and i knew that there was a
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00002.flac	and i knew that um spock was the only name i knew i actually didn't know enough to actually it was
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00003.flac	new york primarily when i'm not working out there and uh
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00004.flac	and understanding of the phenomenon i didn't realize so  there was no huge impact like oh my
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00005.flac	play with lenda hunt that i really wanted to do and so when i got that i turned down star trek actually
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00006.flac	i thought well alright so i came back to new york and actually had a great year i did a uh david williamsom play loved doing it in fact a friend of minefilming in the studio somewhere else who was in the
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00007.flac	enwau and the fans meanwhile were writing all these letters of support and so i thought you know i
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00008.flac	teen autographs on an index car but they really saying we really liked you work i can't believe
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00009.flac	f wonderful so i and i would get them o children and adalt every um age ranch and
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00010.flac	some of these people um i know they get really bad pressed because of like i think
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00011.flac	fan on on a certain level there are some people who are oubsessive about it
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00012.flac	so cluband they have a ball they ae a costume party theyre having halewien every time they ever do this you know so actually i don't
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00013.flac	i we really 'just what you wan i know um i don't know i guess it's not as doctraly
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00014.flac	like i did a play out in mos angels where i could use my own hair i sort of changes uh
id10329_v7mGgUGBKhw_00015.flac	i don't mind um it's a trad off this way i'm not recognized all the time which is which is
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00001.flac	funny show it's uh slightly dirty but um you don't really see any
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00002.flac	because if you go too much one way it becomes too camp oor kind of off putting and if you go too much the other way it can just be naturalistic an
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00003.flac	you knowmolar a whatever but if you can find that line it's very clownsand we had a
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00004.flac	you know and this uh you know all of them really i don't hav there's no favorite i just uh i love them and i love my two
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00005.flac	they were former students of mine i adore them i think they they're people who also make films theyre actors they they are in afilliets
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00006.flac	oukn causeitn relationship it starts out with a couple of and and they're blaming each other and then it turns out they're actually able to because they've changed in some way themselves they're able to see an appreciate the other person which is a very standard sort of thing except that how this
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00007.flac	u well i i'm a choreographer as well as a director and um
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00008.flac	but that they don't go in and go oh i'm comfortable here and this is my seat and everything's gonna happen here that it could happen right next you it ould happen around you and not in a way that you're going to have to be you know get
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00009.flac	a py thrown in your face but in a way of just not knowing what's gonna happen next
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00010.flac	i like films where i don't know what's happening next i like theater where i don't know what's happening
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00011.flac	so that's kindof cool to me and one of the things that i try to do when i do
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00012.flac	could happen right next you it could happen around you and not in a way that you're going to have to be you know get
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00013.flac	a py thrown in your face but in a way of just not knowing what's gonna happen next
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00014.flac	i like films where i don't know what's happening next i like theater where i don't know what's happening
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00015.flac	black box because of that you can pu the chairs anyway you can have the audience in the middle and everything happening around them i like the
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00016.flac	the audience can get dis oriented in a positive way you don't go in there with your head in the programs and just okay this is what this is
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00017.flac	i mean it's nobody makes money r but we most of the people are
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00018.flac	housas with an eighty piece orchastra and we did the acting in between
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00019.flac	tell you how many people loved it and said they had never ever gone to any kind of theater or
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00020.flac	it's popular so hey if you wanna support
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00021.flac	the the theater out here we have shows of all different kinds but the're
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00022.flac	it's really there's so much happening here now and we're struggling all of the theater companies because it's such a spread out city it makes it much tougher but i really feel if we can get
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00023.flac	connected in terms of the people who are doing it tlike i'm really game to put
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00024.flac	do um a series of shorts here or have people be
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00025.flac	ro theater machine roe artist there's a lot of amazing
id10329_vnGHamxUmOc_00026.flac	not all of them do bran new work but a lot of them do and uh
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00001.flac	yeah he at first was just producing it and there were actually a a few sets of thumas and louise before anded t being suson and i uh because he went through a few different directors and then decided i'm just gonna direct this myself
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00002.flac	should play louise that this would be fantastic turning point that i'd play the more mature part and
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00003.flac	i i wanted this so bad and i'm just pitching my heart out and ie brought all my notes and everything about why i absolutely have to be louise
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00004.flac	or i said you know what's so weird is i've been listening to myself as i
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00005.flac	cause you were out in the middle of the desart or something so we're just hanging
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00006.flac	loves movies and loved this script um but i think it was just
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00007.flac	he didn't it immediately wanted to do it himself it was a low budget movie he's used to doing g you know great big things um it was something a eighteen million dollar budget um and and he was gonna have someone else do it but
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00008.flac	because uh he gave it the epic sweep that it has which
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00009.flac	um it i think it could have seemed like a much smaller movie but you know with his
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00010.flac	uh and at the same time was incredibly collaborative and freewheeling the the the thing i knoticed have learned the most about directors is when they're very confident in themselves they're open to creativity from other people if they're
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00011.flac	or nervous then they shut off and nobody's ideas are  don't tellm le tell me your ideas just do it th way i want you to do it and it's not the best wa somebody like saiding
id10330_2FPHpUr_Bss_00012.flac	you know the guy with the delivering the hout dougs says can i say
id10330_4svG40oHL60_00001.flac	hen i heard that they can like bo and throw things at the screen if they don't like a movie they they

id10330_4svG40oHL60_00011.flac	and then shut my mouth i she stu la laughing i got thrown out of
id10330_4svG40oHL60_00012.flac	i 'm i i tried to it's hard work you know the only thing i ve ever actually finished um was an episode of of this tv show
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00001.flac	it came rather easily in fact uh actually wrenny had beento
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00002.flac	this this project for a while before before we met uh but then it it actually started all coming
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00003.flac	but in lots of really fun ways we watched a million pirate movies and we read every book about pirates and also i had uh very extensive training uh for the kinds of stunts that i was gonna have to do i had six months of fencing lessons and horse back wriding and swimming
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00004.flac	d i do everything you can possibly think of in this movie i have scenes underwater
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00005.flac	but it's it's not dangerous i know it's not dangerous because we have
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00006.flac	people and stunt coordinators and everything is very well planed but yet you're you're very uh you're very excited because it it still feels like something
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00007.flac	actually there were female pirots and uh and they were actually quite famous and and quite
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00008.flac	were uh the i guess the most famous female pirots were anbonne and mary
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00009.flac	uh why i ave you know i i think we imply that i've had a lot of love
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00010.flac	and uh i start falling for the slave i by play by mathe modine and why wouldn't i he's so
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00011.flac	uh and also i think he's just so captivating in the movie he's really charming and looks like like era
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00012.flac	hterrifying i'm actually uh afraid of hight saso
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00013.flac	is not oh i have to just act  strong and i have to
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00014.flac	being together we love working together and we both really loved the movie so it was it was actually really inspiring to be able to
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00015.flac	need to to do a movie like this is you have to be very uh you ust have a lot of indurancethe
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00016.flac	because even though it's really fun it's long hours and you have to do a lot of takes and it's
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00017.flac	it can be very strenuous and then you finish a scene one day that was very difficult an end you realized bit tamorrow
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00018.flac	believe the things that i was doing but uh but reny really believes that uh the most fun people can have watching te movie is is if they can tell that it's really the actor so
id10330_CbF8AurFLR8_00019.flac	i am doing another actor picture with him i'm gonna start shooting it in just a few weeks in fact it's called the long kiss good night and weh
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00001.flac	it and you have no control over what it is that's gonna turn out in the end
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00002.flac	you know i need to learn about acting before i can even think about directing especially like getting someone to to listen to me and go okay i'm gonna listen to your direction so everything i mean i love acting and it's i really have a passion for it i think i will always want to do it but um
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00003.flac	i suppose we've got such a great culture for it and it's it's something that's like cultivated as
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00004.flac	iled people want to put you in a box i didn't put myself in a box but other people
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00005.flac	yeah i i really liked i really like strabery feelds i thought she was fun i thought she was witty um
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00006.flac	to get a a job at that point in my career because i was a student had a lot of student det i was a
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00007.flac	you know if i continue to play those kind of roles all the time then yeah you limite yourself but if you if you
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00008.flac	that the surprise element the um i never know i don't have any aspirations of  i want to play this role i want to play that role i love it when i get sente something or
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00009.flac	andchange things all the time everyone can just get on with thei job and if you get the right cameramand
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00010.flac	in unique fresh tone and it's almany different genes of film in one film and if i think if nanybody else maybe tried to direct it it could've gone horriblly wrong and it's masterfully done and very sudtly done by
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00011.flac	iyou become more scru you know you have it more scrutinly and then you scrutinize yourself more it becomes harder i've seen tamara drew like
id10331_GBCgYlOv1ug_00012.flac	it for myself it doesn't really do anything cause like you take it's never gonna be
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00001.flac	when they were young and when i was younger i wasn't i wasn't really aware of bodies and being attractive and i was sort of more interested in in doing my plays and and reading and i i don't know i i just didn't have that kind of power i suppose at you know that sexual prowess that tamara has um so and u yeah i kind of relate to that and but tamar the reason i played tamar is because i didn't relate to
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00002.flac	and i i wanted to work out why she does the things she does i i just found her interesting and because she's so different to me
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00003.flac	um and yeah so ie really had to i based her a lot on people that i've
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00004.flac	in life and i found out to be a very honest and real representation of a modern woman the things that she faces
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00005.flac	the fact that she's imperfect the fact that we never actually get her
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00006.flac	actually people are very supportive but um but it's quite exposing cause they know you from before so you can't be anything
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00007.flac	i don't know i think the interesting thing about the cosmetic surgery thing in this film is that yeah it's easy enough to go and have it done but the way it makes you feel afterwards tamara can't deal with it she can't deal with the fact that people relate to her in a different way and and she feels that she's lost actually something
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00008.flac	somsomething the respect for her sort of changed and she and i thought that was really interesting because there's such a cousmetic surgery 's becoming
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00009.flac	the reprecassions of it it's interesting i think it's good that we spoke
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00010.flac	yeh i mean she she fills the void um she doesn't have anyone in her life that actually loves her and and she she really really wants to be cherished um at the end of the day that's why she she looks for all these men and they sort of fulfill her slightly and but
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00011.flac	a the end of the day she doesn't really get get what she wants she doesn't know what she wants even at the end of
id10331_LwXx-LeYXm4_00013.flac	i uh you know the imperfection is perfection i
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00001.flac	you know the center point is a woman who's sort of not necessarily a showy character or um
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00002.flac	i just her it's quite sort of um gentl um
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00003.flac	funnily enough for catrin i don't think she's aware of it i think at that time i think people just kind of accepted the  we hadn't had that second waf m we hadn't had the feminest movement yet and so it was sort of the we were in the in the nineteen forties you were kind of
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00004.flac	just kind of got on with it i imagine i i would imagine um and what i like about capin is
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00005.flac	she is a feminist  and she doesn't know it yet she just sort of within that circumstance a sort of
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00006.flac	being pushed into soin seden situations where she ends up putting her point down but um and i like that about this film is tht it has a message but it's not it's very very underneath and it doesn't sort of shout about it i's it's just there
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00007.flac	s i mean constructing a film and and
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00008.flac	you know properganda film making so it had to be a certain way and even though you know making films now they can't necessarily make what you wantna make you have to kind of make them around certain
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00009.flac	things like that but yeah it's a it's an incredible uh un incredibly detailed process that i often just before didn't realize how difficult it was
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00010.flac	beproud of this film and i feel like it's a it's a it's it's so wonderful to show it here i mean tonight we've we've got sedeak can sort of
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00011.flac	it's a it's a real love letter to london and and and how how wonderful it is and how wonderful lediverse a culture is and and what we can do here and the and the spirit of uh london so yeah to show it show it here is really exciting and i think it's sort of it's very hopeful and very
id10331_mTAlUFzJ3jQ_00012.flac	yeah but i think that's the for me i i mean my taste in cinmar is is quite bizare and um sometimes i like to be completely disturbed by films but this was is not disturbing it makes you feel uh it makes youfeel happy and it reminds you that you might even feel emotion sometimes um so yeah it's it's i'm very proud of it
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00001.flac	the building on fire she sees smoke um she sees prea you know reacting to it and um her first instinct is to run in and and see if anyone's hert if anyone needs help um it was kind of good cause she's just kind of fearless in that moment so it was nice to see the kind of heroinside of her
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00002.flac	filming oh it was brilliant i mean the fact that when when we read the script uh we were all thrilled and then when we knew we had neel directing it he was like youre gonna be doing ti
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00003.flac	stunt yourself um but we w're all fire proofed up um and it was it was done so professionally and and everyone was just really good on set you know everyone kinda knew on that day we'd have to knuckle down that bit harder um and
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00004.flac	long as the viewers enjoy it than um kind of eyou just kind of put you work in and hope hope
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00005.flac	it was from bit o both really i had a cold when we filmed it so that didn't help um but i had to do lots of shouting lots of kind of gettin grab
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00006.flac	a voice for about three days so i think around the episodes you'll kind of s cale kind of in and out of sounding like silvester
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00007.flac	i'm i'm not sure it's obviously a smoke machine um but the had so we brought guys in um like professional kind of guys from films and it it was amazing really the amount of people who were on set normally you walk on set and there's about you know ten twelve people but there was like over twenty um we had fire firemen in there um obviously lighting the fires putting them out
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00008.flac	o no i did it all myself i kind of when they said you have to lift uh i have to lift john i was lik aiys fine you know i can lift more in the jym so it kind of work  all the jym work came in
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00009.flac	um cause yhe think it wil make them to muscular but we've no were neare
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00010.flac	the love and some of it very shoked um but yeah it's kind of a will they won't they at the minute um with carli coming up with someone
id10332_5BK6NhlLupE_00011.flac	she's ready to meet someone but it's whether or not the kinda go together in that way or if the two good a friends or if theres you know there's anything else involved um so
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00001.flac	hollyogks was very fast paced  really quick turn around so hat you hade to be on the wall with your lines and you know it's the same he
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00002.flac	yes my one of my best friends from holly oks makalan dog she played in cloi she's actually having a baby sone um so yeah i'm gonna be hopefully seeing more of makla um saradonas played
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00003.flac	you know i i said that as soon as i came i said to him he need to come back just cause hi'ld be brillint to work with him um but yeah i think he's he's gott another job now so
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00004.flac	liker and then i think yno they'll find et quite funny and then eventually feel sorry for her and hopefully she'll come
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00005.flac	it was brilliant i mean working out in the states was it was daunting um thankfully i only did um the voice over stuff in the states for the film the film o past was an american movie but it was filmed in russia for nine weeks um and then when we when we raped the film and we had to gover to ula to do um all the sound effects and it was quite funny ecause i was in in my booth ding my voice over stuff and i looked to the left and in the next booth it was will ferrel
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00006.flac	difference being able to go home after a day's work um
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00007.flac	i mean for three years i used to film and then go back to the hotel the same hotel with the same food men ou and he the staff wo
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00008.flac	boyfriend and i'm close to my family so it's nice to go home and see them i just realized i said dog before boyfriend which genuanly is the order it is i' misse my dogor tha my fello
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00009.flac	gyou know great friends and learnt so much about the industry and you know how it
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00010.flac	you know thethe milestones a you know coming of age and stuff um when i was starting out there was always the invite to
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00011.flac	me and it's kind of it's nice to just surround yourself with those people who who you know have but you best interest at heart and
id10332_8FZvUdcpaT8_00012.flac	four girlfriends from bery you know a lord of mates and aquantaences but my four girl friends
id10332_sUeAVe5v7k4_00001.flac	in front of my friends and family so it'll be quite tough uh we start rehearsals on the seventeenth of uh november

id10332_sUeAVe5v7k4_00003.flac	and it killed me my hip bones are killing my shoulders cause itit's it's like a parshuote it's so heavy but they'veassured me the the safety guys that
id10332_sUeAVe5v7k4_00004.flac	now i thought well on the day they'll just do it again but then with the peter pan script if i see a line like that i think ii no you have to learn it now because there's no retake on the day so i think it's a lot more work but i think once you get on stage i the deninill start pumping and i think you can just have a laugh with it really it should be
id10332_sUeAVe5v7k4_00005.flac	give me great advice but i do i do miss hollyogs i mean i still watch it whenever i can

id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00004.flac	well i did have to say the od word and um
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00005.flac	it certainly came back to r me yeah totally um you know t was

id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00013.flac	thirty in my bed in my nice flannelc majamas and there is a bomscate in my hotel and i have they say madam you have to get
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00014.flac	i was um when i was eighteen years old and i was busy being a club dancer and i had to pay my rent i had a lump in my brest and i thought i
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00015.flac	book um by ruth pickerd uh before i say good by and i sware to you i read this book and i
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00016.flac	you know i'd like to say i don't discredit it you know what what we achieved together you know i i thank the spice girls and all the fans wwithout
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00017.flac	amassive learning experience for me you know spiritually mentally i my mind grew a hundred years you know in so many
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00018.flac	t but um i just there was you know the day that i left the spice girls um and i
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00019.flac	um it made me check out my principles actually i was ment to be in this studio doing the
id10333_D5JvrPaUCJw_00020.flac	all into lyrics my album so just before christmas i sketched all the songs and i'm mastering them now so what youre gonna have is this album that's
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00001.flac	we well during it i didn't wanna annalize myself during i you be self concious and then for the first time i picked up one of the copes of the dissk and thought sh is it
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00002.flac	nreally taught me a lesson so i can never say never you know
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00003.flac	ow that encouragement and  girl power if you wanna call it that as existed
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00004.flac	firing encouraging young women and girls you know to  believe in them
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00005.flac	and so if that egnites a new generation fantastic to go out and you know become
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00006.flac	you know wha it took me a real you know it's only it's taken me a few months to wined down from it um
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00007.flac	cause prior to that i was you know writing my books and then i made sure i finished the deadline just before i
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00008.flac	off the to i i was kind of giaring up to start promoting my book and that's quite
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00009.flac	speed and then you suddenly stop it takes you a whiled to suddenly go oh and actually this week
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00010.flac	y of this is that i wrote these i wrote about ugnia way before i knew that a spice
id10333_TEjTSvvzLMU_00011.flac	wanted to create a character thatat was like a rebirth of girl power so i thought how can i reach the next generation and i love
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00001.flac	i feel really proud of what we did but i i kind of think that everything is has it's time i part of me is kind of a little bit
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00002.flac	it was it was fun we were young and you know i've moved on and once you become a solow artist you know i've learned to be a solow artist
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00003.flac	i never say never but at the moment no not at the moment i'm you know i'm i i like
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00004.flac	i t i'm the i'm pproud to say that i'm the only one that's got the original record contract which in this day and
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00005.flac	iit still got me it's a great a relationship i have with hem and you know i still have a career i'm on my third solo album which is
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00006.flac	to be honesti i've really tried not to i think we all go through different stages in life and i i really
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00007.flac	women and men out there that go through that struggle you know of kind of fing themselves of of feeling comfortable and for me it's being a journey of just feeling
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00008.flac	for me i'm i'm really i'm not interesting whether you know
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00009.flac	for my to myself i've i've never dited for a video you know in the
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00010.flac	three meels a day a lot of cardioascula you know really kind of vigilant with that and now i'm just kind of aeas
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00011.flac	they are they are considerations but actually um i think it's one of those things that i have to
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00012.flac	live my life in a box just in case that person turns out to be it's like we all
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00013.flac	y with someone whether they're good looking famous ritch and it's just you and another person in a
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00014.flac	well it's kind of a it's that industry that's breeding you knowthat
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00015.flac	on with people where you just kind you're in a room and you know just out of kind of um polighteness you kind of uh give
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00016.flac	ui mean there's al different ways of writing i've gone in from scratch just with a melody and
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00017.flac	i i i do now because i had ah um nodules and i quit smoking a year ago so now i can sing life but i was always
id10333_eTChefitvmA_00018.flac	've done it a little bit but i've just really gone for it because i you know if i'm gonna be a an artist a serious artist for and stand you know as a live performer i
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00001.flac	la judy hops she is a bunny cop she is the first bunny cop on the police force of zootopia which has been up until this point um comprised completely of
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00002.flac	i think that i am as animated in real life as most of the things that disney puts on hi scree
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00003.flac	an animated form uh i think judy and i are both fercely optimistic and idealistic and a little bit self rightious we're both tryers
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00004.flac	iis a a sly slick fox who uh husseles in zootopia he believes very strongly that you are what you are and you cannot break out of the preconceved notions that are put on you based just purely on the animal that you're born into being and uh judy has to team up with nick as she gets no help from anyone else on the police force uh she has to team up with
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00005.flac	in the very beginning of the film there are fourteen missing mammals in zootopia um judy is not put on a missing mammal's case she's actually meter made but she volunteers uh to the wife of a missing otter to help find the missing otter and she because she gets no help she asks this conman with whom she's crossed paths a couple times nick fox nick wild um to help her solve the case uh because he actually
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00006.flac	and predator all live together in harmony that of course doesn't end up being the case but it is a land where it's a land made up of several different lands of four different lands where the physical habitations um are appropriate for each species of animal it's a place where they can all live and get i
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00007.flac	ia li it's a coushy job i mean i could definitely do this forever i go intin my pjes i bounce around all day i don't have to worry about make up um
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00008.flac	there is something really really liberating about only having your voice to express a character and i never realized before getting involved in animation how much i rely on my face and my body language and even costumes in order to help express who a character is and to only be left with your voice is really
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00009.flac	fnitely think he'll recognize mom's voice uh i will definitely show him the movie i think i might wait on zootopia untill he understands that what he's seeing on screen isn't real because right now anything he might see i mean whiny the poo existss to him in the world and so i don't want to ruin that experience for him in his realizing that well if judy hopps is really mom than judy hopps isn't really a being that i could you know be
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00010.flac	this movie cause it's hilarious uh because it does pack that surprise emotional punch that we all believe going into the the movies they're not gonn affect us cause
id10338_4WZGnkqSEhE_00011.flac	way through because something's incredibly relatable um it's an action movie it's an omage to hollywood cinnama and wonderful tv shows i mean it really it's one of those it really does
id10338_7rfw6JLzKU0_00001.flac	well yesterday i swished with listering

id10338_7rfw6JLzKU0_00013.flac	we have some more uh some new cast members joining us rose magoain joined us um lesly nichle of downton abbe fame joined us um baly madison of course returns to play
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00001.flac	gnna have some some issues growing up having heard wile ind utero all kinds of things about
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00002.flac	perfect i mean it was e we had it was a last minute kind of thing because we thought of ourselves as exceptionally modern and we were like we don't need to get arrid well get married later and then i was nine months pregnt were lie we robably need to get married so at nine months we invited like maybe twenty five people and i was so big my girl friend monee lily h'd desine my dress and i was in the fitting and i was like i
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00003.flac	different name for like six months and both woke up one day and said we just have a feeling that's not gonna be right and oliver wasn't based on anything it was just a name that we adored and there were no family members you know unfortunately uh being honored and it wasn't a literary reference but we were actually all sitting around with my family one day as everyone flew in to wait for me to go into labor which has it's proan con
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00004.flac	dollars to anyone who can guess the babye's name on the first trie but we're not
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00005.flac	tell you we're not gonnatell you today if you guesd it and my little sister said
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00006.flac	ii i mean there were not clus given she just guest she just knows me that well i e don't have to really give her five
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00007.flac	y i gave birth the whole family came in and jonspulled out a check and
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00008.flac	and uh the charmings or the chirm stenes as we call ourselves cause where duish uh
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00009.flac	the plans aren't in this particular situation necessarily wholesome and and the only other time we've seen snow wight go dark she was cursed and i will say that this dark secret is uh is based on free
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00010.flac	i'm literally just hopping around like a sound booth making as you'll see animal
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00011.flac	duper pregnant i mean it's i recorded this for three years when i was super pregnant um they'd asked about my coming in for
id10338_qFE4ZVeSRU0_00012.flac	please let me come in please let me come in and i'e got to work and they had set up for
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00001.flac	would it would close the door for anyone else to understand so it's important to leave it broad enough to be understood and yet private enough to
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00002.flac	i think writing songs every time you finish a song every time you say that song is done you've
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00003.flac	starting songs is the easy is the easy part it's easy to sort of get a cored and maybe one line and but it's finishing a song and saying now i've i've said what i need to say it's rapped up it's done that's when you rea realize how much you've learned in the process and i think it's very important to finish songs even if they're not good songs sometimes it's important just to finish it as an exercise as an intellectual exercise to say okay so this song has been
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00004.flac	a little gost in my head for the last three years and every so often the melody just comes through my head and that line that i wrote so i'm gonna today i'm gonna sit down and i'm gonna finish it
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00005.flac	uh charged up but i'm gonna sit down and as an exercise in using my brain i'm gonna try to finish
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00006.flac	there's definitely been more sweat than there has in the past yeath and id but i don't think it's because inspiration has disappeared i think it's more because i've become more specific about what it is i'm trying to
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00007.flac	basically the same band brought ou ded on base tomas barl on piano and ke boards rob moose on
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00008.flac	but then of course the frames guys are also on there and then the horns that i that i've been working with on tour for the last coupe of years those guys are on there they brought a lot to it
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00009.flac	an then the's a few other musicians that i' that i'd never met before have come and gone uh which which are wonderful to
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00010.flac	it's very important in te studio invironment to challengee
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00011.flac	to to to work with people that you're maybe a little bit intimidated by because they might bring something to your song that you never thought
id10341_04NM8FbghFY_00012.flac	yeah because when you're out of your comforts on magsome magic stuff can happen and
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00001.flac	community of musicians that we know a whole community of great music that's made and i started from the street in a way it's
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00002.flac	you you're toalyu breaking down the the barrier between the whole
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00003.flac	think i learned every every basica rule of music and every basica role
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00004.flac	natural step to take to move from being on the street to dancing well we have this concert in this club after we play on the street we go to the club and we play coots and
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00005.flac	we our our audience came from the street and followed us and then to make a record was a very natural progression from there so the whole thing it never really felt like there ware these were all small gols in one year i would love to be in a band in two years i would love to make a
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00006.flac	have to it's just so ov sometimes it's so overwhelming and something inside you takes
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00007.flac	make the not it's very strange it's very hard to explain how what happens but there'sthis huge energy that comes towards you and
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00008.flac	except on ho much on how much tiner level it so much more sut you know everything you do is so
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00009.flac	two became a very popular band they signed the iland records and and and then the other english magor labl signed many irish
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00010.flac	uh that was very good for us we had we had two really good years with them
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00011.flac	other band who were assigned to our laberl called the cramberies uh did really really well and their record went crazy big it was
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00012.flac	and and you know when something when hthe ir the irony is when something is successful instead of i encouraging everybody else they just
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00013.flac	to be to be our own laber because it may it meant that we could um control everything we do
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00014.flac	feel that we have to deliver a record to a certain uh
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00015.flac	keeping a a smaller band who are really good down i hope that our success
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00016.flac	that if i was in their position maybe i would you know step back for a whe
id10341_o8BjNYSRUqs_00017.flac	i think it's really good it's really good to have success but you must always you must always
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00001.flac	and and after i finished with the record uh and made it i went to jemaka and i spent some time there nd i
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00002.flac	basically through music to take a holiday and turn off your phone and go and go and be still itwas actually quite difficult and i found that when i was out there i i just i found that the music was just all i all i cared about was to listen to like you know i was just
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00003.flac	you know to to to like can booth or or the paragons and just got really into rock steady and wanted to visit you know the studios in kingston and i' and and suddenly i got really excited about music again the moment i took a holiday and then the
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00004.flac	uh i'd opened the book on shamminism a few years ago called rithem and repose and remember it really striking me as a
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00005.flac	so so for instance uh so the moment you go and wa uway
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00006.flac	in in modern in modern day in modern times i like i'll even pll out my phone or whatever  text my mates but t where as actually i remember being a child those were the moments when i imagined my life they were the moments when i invented who i actually am they were the moments when my mind drifted off into space and nowadays you see a kid at a bustup and he's on facebook and he's and he's actually kind of wasting those precious moments where you just let the brain
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00007.flac	you know u i just and what's great about you makear thouse that everybody hans you weed so the he
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00008.flac	and you you surrender the to the moment you're in then no matter what goes right ar wrong
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00009.flac	you know so you have to surrender to the the to the caoss of what
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00010.flac	it feels  it feels a lot easier now to t you know and again having time off because ititwhat what it
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00011.flac	evening hanging out with him and it was actually him who said don't worry about this feeling weird because you know he explained to me that for twenty years you've been a guy up and coming and you've been a guy up against the world and you know and and now that guy has just died and you're you're grieving his death and you're trying and at the same time you're trying on a newsu and having to work harder than ever so you're not getting an opportunity to uh to actually get used
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00012.flac	mark your successes with either a holiday a dinner with your family a botte of shampain if you don't mark your successes the day your ship comes in is gonna be just another day at the office
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00013.flac	to markhim and and and so for me going like when i finished the record goino the
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00014.flac	cand sort of what's the word play with the myth and play with and sort of come try to come up with a better version of what your life is but your life's what your life is and that's ui i was
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00015.flac	ind ourselves in a room singing songs together again the likelyhood of that right now is kind a small because mars off you know living her life and i'm off living mine and if if we get together and i and it feels good then great but uh i think you know
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00016.flac	yyou don't ever wanna pick up your guitaran you know you only ever pick up the guitar to heel yourself you don't pick it up for any other reason but at the same time there's a great joy in playing music and that's where i'm finding myself nowadays as is i just love picking it up and playing you know i' you know i watch
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00017.flac	at the he new orlians jazs festival and i just was absolutely and utterly totally moved by just how much joy is in our music or leaveon
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00018.flac	and uh like dillan came up playing other dillan's first albums full of covers uh
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00019.flac	itititlike the the people who are the people who are born out of that thing of playing other people's music eventually find themselves in that spot where they're like where it when it's all about you it's a heavy burden when it's all about just music then it get's a lot easier that's why in my gigs i'll like like i'll play two or three covers because i need relief from my from my own bolshot you know i i need to i
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00020.flac	it was a few thousand people in front of me and it was one o'clock in the afternoon and i had an hour to fill with just me and a gutar and i was actually genuinely i
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00021.flac	the stage i thought i t was like i was like o pleased don't do this this is gonna ruin the
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00022.flac	the music doesn't qualify because we wrote the songs for a film so i feel really clean about the idea that we can applad them i remember on opening
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00023.flac	eally intense an and and and and and you're kind a hoping you're just you're praying that they're not gonna miss their mar you're sort ofit's like watching a gid you're just hoping that they're gonna get there you know but i remember on opening night
id10341_uKukhDYVBb4_00024.flac	we don't have i don't this is not ours anymore we have nothing to do with this anymore this is yours and so what's great about the tony nominations is that it's all for them and i feel really clean about the fact that we can go and applad them and and be grateful for what the work they've done
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00001.flac	her incredible sense of timing her sense of joy her i mean she just
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00002.flac	six year old daughter and all of a sudden from being you know every night this amazing larger than life woman i i went back to making you know sanwiches
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00003.flac	going back to a character as rich as norma desman uh and to have twenty two years of life and twenty two years of learning my craft more you know more of that um and i
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00004.flac	in london said let's just start from the beginning and i feel like a totally different person that i did
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00005.flac	it's very challenging particularly in this role i think anyone who's ever attempted to play it will tell you it's physically challenging and it's
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00006.flac	yeah i've i've come home and it will be a different take and hopefully people will
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00008.flac	all the a lot of the top writers are now going into that arena also in in in
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00009.flac	i i mean i do because i do i do anything that uuh that the script even
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00010.flac	al you know i i a i mean on the last couple of years i think i've done about five or six independent
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00011.flac	and i like the character but as far as big you know you get a good hefty pacheck
id10342_3ULaml6QbpI_00012.flac	challenging so i i think thi story of norma desmand is as relevant
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00001.flac	the world occording to garp i think i think i was had just done one movie
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00002.flac	no i i think when i started i i've produced for television
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00003.flac	you know i i have a production company there was a time when i was really doing that quite actively and tyou know this then came up as a story that i
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00004.flac	you know trying getting back to it you know working again getting a window of a
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00005.flac	you know it's uh ffor example when i did the scout ten years ago itwas with patritia from brondanstene ias one of of the great one of the great
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00006.flac	and she was on board with us ten years ago and when it came again when we
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00007.flac	gathering our our team for for you know when we knew we were gonna make it she was the first call and she's never forgotten like me she had never forgotten the story she loved the story for her own personal
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00008.flac	amazing team to do that my the man who made the wigs uh both
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00009.flac	that he was he was you know really really important
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00010.flac	uh happy sad you know taicomic ut the first great clown that i was aware of when i was little was
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00011.flac	cuseand wed go every year and he was a set he was like a i think  that character came out of the depression
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00012.flac	that shadow a very sad face but would just have the audience howling so i loved as a child to you know seeing somebody sad making you laugh you know so i think there were elements of that in albert so i studied charlie chaplin because um
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00013.flac	i was interested in what made him funny in the way he
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00014.flac	his pants are much too long his shoes are are clownshooes really so i
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00015.flac	guys would have had pants too long and shoos too big so my pants are
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00016.flac	lead to her comportmant ones she's is bound by the corcit but also she's a waiter and there was a kind of a
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00017.flac	i think they they definitely were aware that this character was a
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00018.flac	certainly was he'd say there heres albert you know and but i also
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00019.flac	um i yeah i think it was more shocking to them when i came not being albert because they were reminded
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00020.flac	long hours and with a short scedul i was mostly in albeart you know mode
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00021.flac	kind of feeling thing because it's about working people it's about the back halls of of a hotel it's people who are in motion all day long so we wanted to have a camera that wasn't static that kind of
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00022.flac	close up to catch what actors were doing um i think they're directors who
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00023.flac	who don't really know sometimes where to put the camera to capture what a what an actor's
id10342_K62dGvC7BYU_00024.flac	so that was very important you know and um brogu and i were very much on very much on the same page
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00001.flac	i think this is a perfect time for this movie to come out and that's what's so ironic that it took  so long to
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00003.flac	s that you actually forget what you're looking at and jgender becomes erelevant and i when i that makes me think cause i think
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00004.flac	es you know you might go into this film thinking you're gonna see something and you'll come out really
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00005.flac	had huge uh respect for her she's a great stage actress and i literally walked into her dressing room and she was doing mary stuwart and said would you do this part um
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00006.flac	he was one of my sons um mark williams who plays the wonderful drunkon uh waiter he was one of my
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00007.flac	well first of all i believe i believe profoundly in their talent you know and i know what they'll bring to it and then youre
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00008.flac	you know what everyone longs for you know tthe best of the best a but even our our set designer our our production designer patricia onbronesdena h'd worked
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00009.flac	is one of the greats and there she was in our little movie trying to figure out how to make it for five sents and what she did was
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00010.flac	had no rights and we're literally thrown out on the street so um i don't know if she would 've chosen that uh for her you know but for at that moment when she
id10342_XIlwmHdX-Rw_00011.flac	disappeared that was that was a logical choice the other character you know has a is a  whole different
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00001.flac	it's in good helth i mean for instance to speak for my country it is a majority movement
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00002.flac	now all of the fundamental issues of equality including reproductive issues are majority issues and that's true in many if not most countries and we know
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00003.flac	uh how we feel about women as a group it's not about sitting around and criticizing who is a proper
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00004.flac	funeral aren't they because she cut off the milk for children i mean you know the point is not to get a job for one woman it's to make
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00005.flac	well of course it's a feminist issue regardless of who it is if they were marcions it would be a feminist isue you know because it's
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00006.flac	that is especially hard for many men who feel regressed to childhood when they see a powerful woman they haven't seen one since they were ight
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00007.flac	there's a lot of deep feeling that it's just not right somehow that it's against
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00008.flac	you know women are too emotional because you know we associate it with childhood it's
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00009.flac	on campas when she ran for president before there were young white men wering t shirts that said too bad oje didn't marry
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00010.flac	if you wanna defin yourself and i wanna define myself we have to let other people
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00011.flac	because she had african american siblings i think and had been living as an african american an
id10343_TFIZ9vWg6EE_00012.flac	so i can understand there's discomfort but the rock bottem thing is that we have to accept
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00001.flac	speaking for myself as an average person at the time i
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00002.flac	equality of males and females i would ad acting on it
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00003.flac	now we're in a a more difficult fase a slower fase of trying to actually
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00004.flac	the way that famfamilies uh actually do and don't rase
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00005.flac	quantity is not quality you know just because we have now almost fifty percent
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00006.flac	that it's equal and the other problem is that of course we have two jobs for the most part i mean poor women always had two jobs one at home and one outside the home and now most
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00007.flac	the culture that didn't wanna change and therefore said first said you can't be
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00008.flac	and then an when we did it anyway said okay providing you do it
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00009.flac	because society didn't wanna change so it was it was a recalcetrn
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00010.flac	it's not about integrating a not so good system it's about transforming
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00011.flac	and i think women are saying that so you itit's actually probably more useful to think of women
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00012.flac	groups we probably have a hard time making it up through
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00013.flac	both because it's hard to get up through somebody else's hierarkhy and because they don't
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00014.flac	no i mean it's patriarchal politics it as usual because the very definition of patriarchy is is
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00015.flac	so every patriarchy in different ways tries to control how many workers how many soldiers uh which races or classes should increase more
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00016.flac	fredm as a fundamental right we are seazing control of the means of
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00017.flac	this is the biggest determinete of whether we're healthy how long we're gonna live are we  educated can we work
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00018.flac	every single issue raised by the feminist movement is now supported by a majority of americans ind public
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00019.flac	the not so genteale part of the backlash is all the anty laws you describe but both of them are amed at at
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00020.flac	if you grow up in a home in which it's okay
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00021.flac	you can directly prodict the amount of violence in public life or foran
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00022.flac	a catholic and a protistant woman saying we've had violence in the home too long we know that that's
id10343_TmFxFmrcngk_00023.flac	nothing absolutely nothing that isn't affected by the female half of the human race as well
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00001.flac	one way is to say we've realized that women can do what men can do and that's a big step forward because that was certainly not the fifties but we haven't even begun to realize that men can do wha
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00002.flac	that that was really helpful cause i think we get a kind of brainwashing in school o
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00003.flac	u iss it's hard to express my dad simply you know because he was a play mate and he was
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00004.flac	very nice patient person who looked after me at least as much more than my mother really cause my
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00005.flac	table  a wonderful way you know we always had dreams and everything was gonna be great and
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00006.flac	i saw it but i thought that i could get around the system or something i
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00007.flac	no i would pretend that wasn't gonna happen to me but but it was always there and also i saw
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00008.flac	not because my father was not a nice person but because that's the way the world ran she she had to give up everything she loved and cared about she was a newspaper reporter
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00009.flac	admit that it could also happen to me so now when i hear a young women saying i hope i can have as interesting a life as
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00010.flac	t uh you know people and she said people ask me why i'm not married i say i just say i can't made in captivity and i knew if i said it i would get in big trouble but ultimately i couldn't resist no but it was because the picture of marriage that was
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00011.flac	you know not for two whole people so i kept saying i'm gonna get
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00012.flac	a question for elegable men one end two did you vote in
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00013.flac	villan th wa mt this is for one and three one and three okay which one of batman's villan's best describes your love making
id10343_nQZLZ8uoddE_00014.flac	one at least has some idealism i figure even though the guy
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00001.flac	um because i got to the last program and how ironic you know it was in france and that's wher it'
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00002.flac	it was up in umbeside um bonaparts restaurant and i went to meet
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00003.flac	and they served me a frosen scoller that i think the cat had pissed on the night before and i had
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00004.flac	uh to london and i said to uh aur aep producer patlawelin i said
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00005.flac	serious because i i need to get back to my kitchen because you've got no idea how bad this is for me to be away from such amazing food in my own resturent to go and eat shit that's cooked by
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00006.flac	and secondly he served me food wheare the cat has literally pisted on it because i've never met or eaten a scollep so stinking in all my life
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00007.flac	but i'm excited because i think these last
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00008.flac	is for of the best programs we've ever made because the team were great uh
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00009.flac	'pered with no asers i do't wanna walk around with renaz in my pocket and dijects uh in my
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00010.flac	back away for the last seventeen minutes uh so no i wantta get back
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00011.flac	say it's going away and it's finishing forever it may
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00012.flac	i had a massive upset in foot ball when i was nineteen and i got kicked out in my as and
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00013.flac	and even today now we're the longest serving british restarant uh with three missian stars uh in this country uh
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00014.flac	because there's two ways in this industry you you move with it or it moves you and i've seen so many sad stories across the
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00015.flac	got lazy given up and lost that hunger to be competitive because it's the best job in the world that's not really a job it's a passion because when you're rubbing shoulders and here we are now ten years later and i
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00016.flac	so that's exciting for me and that's been the one ke issue across the ten years of filming kitchen
id10346_DGAMFoQeLks_00017.flac	i missed it so much when i came back i came back twice as strong so you know i think it's good to stop i wan na get out on top but more importantly i wana come back
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00001.flac	but i am a bloddy good teacher and i think it's important to understand the discipline of perfection
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00002.flac	yeah i ma's it's a very emotional thing for any chelf you know it's like losing a girlfriend um you you want her back um i think every top cheff in the world from alan dukas uh to gu ceva you know when you lose a star it's
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00003.flac	losing the champians leg there's next year so it's not done forever that you can't winthe
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00004.flac	question literally two weeks ago um on holiday what would you do if you ever lost your third star honestly i would win it back so you know it's it's it's it's nice to stay
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00005.flac	but for the most amazing cheffs when you are twenty one years of age working in one of the best restunts in the world standing in parise
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00006.flac	keen to learn and you've got a great chefs reputation in your hands if you make a mistake
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00007.flac	level of perfection uh they give you that trust you let them down man you g
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00008.flac	uh i keept my mouth shut uh i was twenty one twenty two years of age the good news for me wals
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00009.flac	hats my real life its a really good question that um would be my mother's uh breadand btter pudding because we didn't grow up with lots of money uh fredy we we we it was a humble insight uh we moved around a
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00010.flac	udad was always losing his job and every time he got a new job it came with a house  he lost his job he um we moved the family around so bread and butter pudding but beautifully done done with stale bread um custard sultanas and then sometimes as a treat
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00011.flac	yshe worked as a nerse in the evening and she worked as a cook in a restaurant in strapo on ivan during the day so the food thatdidn't sell in the restaunt she did to bring home
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00012.flac	they sometimes when my mum comes to the restaurant a you can't give i the bill case you can't do that bo your mam right
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00013.flac	i come out in a rash and my my my skin starts getting iritated
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00014.flac	i mean t's the level of you know starch that we need in terms of dayly balance so um it really makes cheffs work alittle it harder to create vegetarian food to become just as exciting as your your your normal food on the men but uh yeah
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00015.flac	mom a dad thi's his big englishman with a nice people ie accent and uh so they haven't sen me on television yet god help
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00016.flac	s the children to reeducate the parents i think in three or four years time we can start to understand that even if you never follow it as a career just learning to cook
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00017.flac	and for me that's that that's fundamental so that's the reason why were we're filming
id10346_ETuCbSf3YjY_00018.flac	tosixty four pounds and i was thirty three years of age and i had achieved what i wanted to set out and do in the colenary industry i i had one my third

id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00002.flac	the day needs the picture you know today and circumstances needs this picture very much and i sort of hesitated about it i said why are
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00003.flac	wouldn't you like to play ms miniver and uh it was not anoffer it was an abliek sort of thing where upon norma said well gres playing that
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00004.flac	out of the window again nothing more was said but of course when the pictures came out and poor norma her little comedy which was light and funny uh was not a very well
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00005.flac	that she had been offered the part and turned it down hat she wasn't really offerd the part i was to play the part and that was it and walter ou
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00006.flac	we made seven pictures together seven in the half we wodn't talk about the half it was a clinker but we
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00007.flac	certain pictures together nd we never had an insecure thought about each other or um an angry cross word or a tiff or anything like that it was he most wonderful partnership wonderful
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00008.flac	when his wife called me ruoth called me last summer and told me the bad news i was in
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00009.flac	uheverybody the the cameraman was a well one of the great artists of hollywood of course josepf ruttenberg uh the the
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00010.flac	peoples everywhere and we all tried to make its as special as we could as
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00011.flac	easy to me and then of course came experiences that none of us over here recalle
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00012.flac	but my family and my friends were all envolved i had tried to
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00013.flac	back to england to serve in some way in the war i was embarrassed being
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00014.flac	wer actually falling the place where i lived had lived and the city that i loved and the people i
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00015.flac	necatives of ngma trying to released me from my contract i flew to see the british ambassader and he was very charming he said uh

id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00018.flac	very interesting i kind of disappeared for a while into the charming personality of mses miniver and you know and we for a while perhaps as an actress i was a little restless
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00019.flac	a great reason to be thankful and grateful so many actors do better and better work through
id10348_KIy0AGQSAJc_00020.flac	i stop in new york or losangelis or dalas for an intersection trafic light you know waiting for the gosigne ocross and nearly always somebody would
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00001.flac	randem harbes uh he was so wonderful in that part and i was so happy when
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00002.flac	it's the roal comand performance so naturally the stars come over and the we have the honer of being presented
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00003.flac	odn't remember but anyhow uh king george was so kind to me he said
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00004.flac	um there were groups especially of course at war time uhwe were all workworking for the british red cross and putting on benefits and that sort of thing but we always
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00005.flac	tu whatever we did for british red cross naturally we also would do the same thing for american red cross so we were together a good deal in in benefit performances and things we put on a season of no coard in hollywood went very well we all changed hats the series actors played comedy the comic actors played
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00006.flac	i sang as i drove to the studio in the mornings i looked forward so much to another day in this wonderful group and wonderful lifestory wonderful love story
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00007.flac	quiet scenes turbulent scenes intimate scenes crowd scenes and uh we collected a great group of actors as i told you mervin laroy was a dear he always had some of the old timors coming out of the woodwork and playing small parts and they were so grateful to him for that and it was a joy to
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00008.flac	believable well you can make them believable but to make them interesting is quite a challenge quite ait's much more
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00009.flac	but it was my lot to play good ladies and dove dove women and on te stage i had played some peecock
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00010.flac	well i was quite certain that i would eventually be in a play that was good enough to go to broadway that's really the way i would like to have gone to america everybody was curious about america we all wanted to go to america not necessarily to live there in fact thit was never my intent
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00011.flac	for a few days and then we found we had so much in common he'd started at north hamton repertory i'd started a burming a reportory and we used to have little jokes if he made a mistake id say hu
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00012.flac	the  director said cuts cut it was mervinaroy cut what is it this time what's the matter and a voice from way back you know fifty feet fifty uh yards
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00013.flac	i was making te you sey i wasn't making tee but somebody was making te for me and then  wa anyhow as i say we served um uh a cup of tee cup of jin
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00014.flac	i because he insisted on having jin in the afternoon and i didn't i sai i wodn't want any pantry drinking on this said you' come and have your te in your own tea cup
id10348_L0y-9ignSgs_00015.flac	oh we had we'e played so many practical jokes on each other it's amazing the picture iever got
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00001.flac	from the film institute in losangeles and we stood up together on the platformand i said here we stand survivors of the wiler wars and so two of the milestones the human milestones along the brilliant road of a superb
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00002.flac	and what would you like us to say and soon  we we had a few jokes you know because he was kind of fifty take
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00003.flac	into some kind of mental oristhetic jum and he wouldn't tell anybody why
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00004.flac	igt remember a scene when we were early scene when we were filing into the church
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00005.flac	the day that war was declared and the victor interupted his cermon to make the
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00006.flac	we're all filing in were of course everybody in those days was aware of the danger ut i think nobody ever quite believed it
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00007.flac	was holding i was holding him by the hand ans we walked in i think i was turning and talking to some nice lady as we went in um just rubarb and sausages rubarb and saussages not real dialect dialog i mean just somn noises crowd noises moving into the church and the  little boy reached out and picked up the heavy lion and ring doorhandle on the
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00008.flac	came back we did about twenty eigh eight more anyhow it was something like the fifty
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00009.flac	what is that i can tell you now i dod wat to tell you cause the boy a little boy would 'ave done it in a self conscious way and i wanted i wanted the business to be just as it was before quite spontaneous so we
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00010.flac	in it reported in the english press and the american press as a two hours an a
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00011.flac	the evience anyhow it was quite a moderst speech it was too long because at twelve o'clock at ngh
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00012.flac	informal meeting we had dinner and nothing was regulated for tv timing or anything like that
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00013.flac	upsince four forty five that morning i'd been working in madam cu which was a heavy picture to do and i was so tired i had a blind
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00014.flac	i took the opportunity which i should not have taken of course to say that i thought the
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00015.flac	one of the best opportunities of the year and in the opinion of your peers uh you have risen to the opportunity and done a professional job that's enough but to choose one arbitrarily and and and give them a lovely statue
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00016.flac	and uh we all support each other it's a wonderful and generous
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00017.flac	s a distracting change of light you have to do it again or if the'r noise is off if a donky brase not
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00018.flac	uh i have been surprised to hear young critics who are not old enough really to know wha they're talking about uh
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00019.flac	the made uh delighteful actress who behave very
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00020.flac	simply delightful and it was all very real and the shopping and the uh pleasant stationmaster i don't know what they're talking
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00021.flac	and the appurtenences the home was rather plesant after all clemmieva was an arcitect and i imagine he did a rather nice job on his own house and the house was not overly grandish at all
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00022.flac	and uh you know m gm wrewere really verly generous they could have held it back when they smelt the sweet sweet smell of success uh from the early previews
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00023.flac	president rosavelt asked them to get it out in general release so hete as many people could see it as soon as possible i like to think that
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00024.flac	in america i don't blame people for not wanting to get into a war
id10348_htGoC9IiAPc_00025.flac	it was a globelwar and it would have affected america disasterously anyhow if the freedom loving
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00001.flac	um he at first i thought he was he's an atrien and he's roman's best friend and he has no love for the human
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00002.flac	and at first i thought he was just gonna be just some angry atrian hating on the humans and then later episodes you find out the reasons behind it that kinda validates
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00003.flac	i mean besides the obvious is how beautiful nateli is an taylor is
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00004.flac	she's she doesn't she's kind of a fire ballo herself she doesn't really
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00005.flac	she doesn't seem afraid of me like everybody else i think li drake so i think that's what he's drawn to she's kind of like the elpof
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00006.flac	hhe sees a different side of of the humans through her it's fun i love our stuff together now
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00007.flac	yeah she's funny but then she can turn on the serious to i i mean she's real
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00008.flac	i don't have any like special powers as far as like hatwhat terie's tribe has
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00009.flac	mean he just is very hardheaded and he's very sure about himself in not an arogant way he just knows who he is and
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00010.flac	he's of the warier trid and the trags who are like a
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00011.flac	of evil atrian crew they recreude him and at
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00012.flac	i mean like i said drake and roman ar best friends um i always compared drake to kind of like the mercutio to to
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00013.flac	roman's in love with memory you know he doesn't get it all s he has ever known as paint with the humans and um tery he's he's good friends with tery although now their relationship is being tested cause tery's doing some shady things and then uh
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00014.flac	and sister he he has a lot of love for her more of a sister relationship cause roman and drake are so tighte
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00015.flac	the other three they haven't really established who they are yet they're great you know but they haven't really established like what tribe these guys are from they're more like they've kinda been more background but i think as a
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00016.flac	ndi'm not just saying this and i feel like i always say i these writers merridath and adel what they've created this world i mean there's so many intricate things going
id10349_8VlMBWsbL0o_00017.flac	now i know everyone you know says that about their show but i really mean itlike i'm excited for them to to see this adventure
id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00001.flac	stufs amazing i didn't think it was gonna be so huge uh ai mean i was walking through and i went to the pub across the
id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00002.flac	and uh i am one of seven aliens um but the our whole race is uh imprisoned in this sector and then ten years later they uh choose seven of us to get integrated into the earth school system so it's like the trials and tribulations of that and
id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00003.flac	to that and there's a love story boy uh you know alien boy meets human girl there's the romieo and juliet so it's a really
id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00004.flac	i i loved it i and i loved my character i i originally i didn't think the character was gonna be so prominent in the show and they kinda um you know they liked the character and they expanded on him and i just i loved every second of shooting ti
id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00005.flac	yeah we have uh mat lanter from nine o twoin oh and ma tegarden from friday night lights they're both great they're the two leads uh my love interest nattelie hall she was the best actress i've ever worked with she's like went to a acting high school

id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00009.flac	i think the world you know i can speak for for my show the the world that merredath and adel the creator's created were was just so intricate and i think that's what people dig about scy f and fantasy is that there's this whole fantasy world that's created that you can kinda just pick from and and your imagination just runs wild it's
id10349_QGlexcvxGFo_00010.flac	um i wrote a film called danty boy that i'm staring in and producing and we should be starting that in the fall

id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00001.flac	to one was if you have money i think it's important to act in a proper way and act in a classy way um and not be intitled and not just kind of go through your years being wild and and
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00002.flac	and if you're on the other end of the specto spectrom financially i think it's important to ssee somebody
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00003.flac	everybody has a tough life everybody has their own problems and their own secrets but sometimes the ritch even have more you know and it's uh
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00004.flac	definition of afloenza is you know a disease where people are consumed by earning as much mony as possible which i think
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00005.flac	appreciate the kind of simple things in life not that i'm like some
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00006.flac	you know god that's trying to like bring some light on the world but i think it's important to be
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00007.flac	uh i've always been quite a strong character in my eyes you know when you're fifteen and
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00008.flac	or take drug it doesn't really interest me um but pressures of course you know you know if you have a meeting at eight o'clock in the morning and all your friends are going out till one o'clock in the morning obviously as a young kid you wanna experience live you wanna hang out with your friends but sometimes you make sacrifices and i think in order to get to the top
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00009.flac	you have to make sacrifices otherwize your life becomes one big party and then you know you don't actually appreciate the parties cause you're out all the time so so yeah pressures you know of course at seventeen years old i moved to the states by myself it's not
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00010.flac	um nicola's been doing fantastic grant doing fantastic he's
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00011.flac	is now on afantastic and very well respected tv show and i remember looking around and
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00012.flac	drop you know but i did look around and think these guys are so talented and and this movie could be the next crop ond the next
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00013.flac	including myself keep um working hard and and and doing amazing things in regards to like career work but
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00014.flac	l of them um have the capability of going extremely far and and for sta
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00015.flac	um i think we're the most selfish i think we're the most
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00016.flac	um loyalty doesn't matter i think it's just a very i think honestly we live in a very sad society and i think if it continues to go this way there's gonna be a lot of funerals uh
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00017.flac	a lot of empty funerals which is very sad and i don't wanna be like a downer but i do think that tecnology as amazing as it is
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00018.flac	is absolutely herrendous for our society and our well being you know if you go on a subray for example people think it's quite weird that i talk to
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00019.flac	like i'm only asking how your day is and they think i'm like trying to find out everything about their life so um so yeah i think that's something that if if we could change it would be amazing but
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00020.flac	me that in order to stay at the school i had to quit acting um and i told him that i completely disagreed with what he had to say because i think the whole point of school is to kind of let
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00021.flac	um really appreciate what's going on around you really appreciate your friends really
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00022.flac	um life you know in my opinion have a half glass ful mentality i think that that's the best thing because life isn't pperfect
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00023.flac	there will be more um and through hard times when the chips are down
id10351_8hs4d7i6kwU_00024.flac	very important to be strong you know whether it's on the smaller scale if you're having troubles at
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00001.flac	i think now that we're doing this whole like you know this right now of course brings back memories but it's it was a good time to end the show the show when had four fabulous
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00002.flac	and i made some amazing friends out of it i made some great relationships out of
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00003.flac	and i'm just very very happy that it ended when it ended and also it ended the way
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00004.flac	and and also just the crew you know a lot of crews never get mentioned but the crew was i think the reason why the the show did so well um of course no one sees hat on tv they just see the cast but
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00005.flac	grew uprobably the best crew i've ever worked with the nicest crew i've ever worked with the most friendly crew i've ever worked with and yeah it was they were like my family you know i had like father figures mother figures lods of step mams um cause my you know my family
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00006.flac	so ant nice to kind of have that stability you know when i it was weird when i went to work i felt like i was driving
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00007.flac	like whim at the wan is already prov in tat it doesn't work so him ith even more powers
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00008.flac	i think you know they all blank the problem you know the problem is when you do a tv show is they all blend into into into into one n you can't remember where the weeks go you can't rememberwhere the episode but the first one you always remember and i remember that very well
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00009.flac	um and then we had a after that episode we have had a one hour special which
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00010.flac	dance special effects and then there was an episode called um harperella which came out maybe two months ago which was pretty
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00011.flac	und then of course the last one it's pretty sad tho wanly remember four episodes out of
id10351_lMsf6vGr7Ew_00012.flac	um so for me it's become very very very natural
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00001.flac	a love him as an actor and i love our dinamic on the show uh and that's ginna be gonna be a aa big
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00002.flac	based on two girls who are mistakenly identified as lesbions in high school and it kind of catapots them to popularity and it's one of them happens to be alesbian and in
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00003.flac	yeah exactly and so it's kind of one of those shows which has been amazing for me to be on because it's set such a positive message to people watching
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00004.flac	school itself is a character of the show in in heste high you kindaf have to stand out to fit in um where as most schools they kindaf
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00005.flac	yeah no it's it's i don't know how i wo'd react to be honest i went to an al
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00006.flac	prom was such an aqward we don't have prom bu like school dances i was so auquard and so shi
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00007.flac	channel and i played celin agomis uh love interest but soawerewso that was

id10351_np90tQygIJg_00010.flac	en since she was like twelve um and we're family friends and we kind of
id10351_np90tQygIJg_00011.flac	it makes me sound so inteligent as i'm really not i i i droped ot of
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00001.flac	sometime after the movie greenberg came out which i acted in which he directed and wrote uhif i would be interested in collaborating on a project with him
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00002.flac	so much at that time i had not finished anything as a writer so i actually had all this
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00003.flac	assembled a lot of it together and i sent it all to him and i said
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00004.flac	it started from very little we we really discovered it together
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00005.flac	end of it i can't tell you where the egs are they're just kind of in there and so there's there's parts of my life and noan's life in the movie and people we know and things we've made up and once it's all in there though it really feels like it all belongs to the movie and the
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00006.flac	age story is something you dyouthat happens again and again and again throughout your whole life and
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00007.flac	you're charged with the task of shedding an older version of what you thought you should be or what you you wanna be and deal with what you actually are or what's actually in front of you and i think that happens at twelve i think it happens at thirty i think it happens at fifty eight i think it happens all the time and i think
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00008.flac	against the forces that work in her life and instead of responding as a rational adult she becomes almost
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00009.flac	well i've i love dancers um i know a lot of dancers i've never
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00010.flac	so heartbreaking because even if you do succeed the rewards are so small
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00011.flac	a a dancer as opposed to a painter or a writer or a actress or a um
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00012.flac	dancer really does have a time limit in the way that aleates have time limits
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00013.flac	it probably won't happen and i think one thing in the film that we explore is that there's not a time that being a choreographer has a much longer life but that being a dancer in that way
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00014.flac	there's a deadline there's a terminus and i think that one of the senes in the film is that that is approaching at the same time as her friendship with sophie is unable to sustain itself so it was two things that worked in youth but not in
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00015.flac	um he does that with his actors you only read the part that you're in and so
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00016.flac	in francis we took that idea and we only gave people the parts they were
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00017.flac	role and then they would be sad to give up acting but if there are no good roles then i would rather
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00018.flac	n you know i think i don't  no one ever said that to me but i do think twenty seven was the first time i ever heard anyone was ik up untill twenty
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00019.flac	and you've got so much time and then all of e sudden you're twenty seven and everyone's like well
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00020.flac	you should probably figure this out and it's it was like it happened overnight and i i i felt like it was just the i was sort of just ecoing this idea of um it's the first time in your life when you're not
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00021.flac	in some ways it's that that line is people bring it up all the time
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00022.flac	i think i think i i think i wrote that line it was almost to throwaway it was just like a joke she says and then sometimes you know you're writing a line that feels quotaible
id10352_47enE06uMLU_00023.flac	uh i don't i don't know it was ii don't know where that lo came from
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00001.flac	we really take our time with thi script because we we don't um we don't have any we don't let anybody improvise or even change a a word we like it really said the way it's written um because it's very
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00002.flac	and um yeah it it just i mean writing an script takes takes time um so it's a lot of talking a lot of looking at other movies we're inspired by a lot of uf writing material we tend to write material separately and then we um at some point we have tons of material
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00003.flac	when we're when we're together but um it's kind of like it's hard to say exactly when things start but it's we do we kind af build the story and the characters at the same time and there's just a point when
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00004.flac	and thn you think oh this actually isn't so bad and then and then eventually you have something that you're like oh yeah if we shot this we'd be
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00005.flac	uh at a certain point we'll like know an ending and um and
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00006.flac	n then and there's a certain point when you sort of jump ahead and then jump back and then um yeah but an ending will
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00007.flac	i think learning how to take criticism is is a skill i don't think it's something you inately know how to do but i think i really learned by um watching noa and i'm friends with a lot of other writers the best writers i'm
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00008.flac	seek out people's opinions constantly they don't go away in their room and try to make it perfect
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00009.flac	they show drafts to people they rework things all the time and i think there's this uh
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00010.flac	there's this myth of an artist that goes away and makes a perfect thing and then comes out and shows everybody i don't think that's true of the people i know who are writers they're like they're always seeking and
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00011.flac	to yourself instead of um let it happen to you to like go to people and say what do you think i should change what do you think not not working what joke
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00012.flac	s that thing if someone writes a joke that you know you
id10352_9lXaK5ExJtU_00013.flac	something else but she didn't know that it was my my joke it's just like you feel like you gotta get your material out there cause you know we're all trying to make jokes about
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00001.flac	and sacraimento is like a a town where you you don't get a lot of like
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00002.flac	oh my god i've been looking at the wrong thing i've been looking i mean not that looking at actors is the wrong thing
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00003.flac	watched it if i liked something n than i just watched everything the director had done
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00004.flac	and jelica and ika centarpas and walter read and whicherd
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00005.flac	u shakespeare play and i hav one word ai
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00006.flac	i was i had been i i was dating at the time someone who had made
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00007.flac	with joke wanber but i hadn't really met joke  had non met him once brifly but i
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00008.flac	he said it's not hard cor it's mumblecor because it was so hard that the sound quality was so bad uh
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00009.flac	for a while it was like things mae cheeply things improvise
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00010.flac	in films as they saw presenting lives that they were like but that's not how we live our lives this is how we live our lives like that's not how we have sex or talke to each
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00011.flac	and and it allowed them to watch these kinds of films where as before they
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00012.flac	i i i took a lot of i wanted to say guts but i think it was really more
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00013.flac	go for which i i i mean i i can say that because i feel like i'm i'm twenty
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00014.flac	and u but i i lived i lived in in pa ian i shared um
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00015.flac	it was very like yeah it was very traditional i was i was auditioning a lot i had a
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00016.flac	in love with this part and i just but i didn't think that there was any chance tho
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00017.flac	and how a human these people were but the it it was
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00018.flac	and i saw i mean i right away i felt like i saw it was less falling in love with florence and more
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00019.flac	and i saw i mean i right away i felt like i saw it was less falling in love with florence and more i felt like falling in love with rogers through florence's eyes pretty
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00020.flac	n you'd have if you were in los angelt's like they're fighting through trafic it's
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00021.flac	use books from college and i just like it was so nice to be able to contribute like that
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00022.flac	i it would be the opening sequence i didn't know it would be the driving or that's what you mean uh i didn't know
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00023.flac	i think thapart of what whyit works so well is because um we dod it for so long
id10352__Rv9E1elutE_00024.flac	ees tat gaopanacaus and you're supposed to laugh but i think there's always something cool about people that youare you disupposed to laugh are you acting uhwhat's happening right
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00001.flac	uh it's been really fantastic especially to have both of these films you know bell being my first lead in a movie and and and then you know closely followed by beyond the
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00002.flac	year for costumes i have to say you know in bell obviously um set
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00003.flac	contrasting and you know the world of of the piece is very egy and modern but as you say the themes of identity um you know ththe themes of a a woman sort of struggling with who she is and then finally accepting herself and
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00004.flac	commen in both and i didn't see it at first um and now i i i appreciate
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00005.flac	uh lord mansfieeld who is played by magnificently by tom wilkinson in the film he
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00006.flac	itle snippets that wer ther were about dido um you know in someh
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00007.flac	a woman of color in a period drama who wasn't a slave who wasn't a made who wasn't in a subservient role but had sort of a dignified um position in society
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00008.flac	ch a wonderful director really brought out a lot of the contempory resonances and and really we talked a lot about the universal
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00009.flac	me ii suppose you know i i learned so much um from working with tom hanks who first directed me in america you know as a leading
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00010.flac	he brought to the set with that movie nd you know which which is that you're not just a a leading actress but you are sort of leading
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00011.flac	o pesona you know the idea that um more so i think for music artists than actors thankfully but um you know tha tha you have uh or or my character noni has this um very sexualized identity that has been crafted for her by her record label and her her
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00012.flac	to you psychologically if you're never allowed to switch off and especially in the case of noni if if the persona out there about you is
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00013.flac	anthe time to develop any sense of self asteame so um you know
id10353_5tLR1dha3sI_00014.flac	iwas a little busier now and and um ijust about to do another project so there so there's a lot of sort of
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00001.flac	i don't know if i would experience it myself um i think it's one of those things i do think that certainly in our episode for our characters it's a positive experience but um i don't know i think i'd have to see if i
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00002.flac	yeah it's hard to talk about it without spoiling without spoiling the story but um i don't know
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00003.flac	umi i have to i think i have to believe i believe in the romance of aof our episode a hundred percent um you know again it's hard to talk about you know um how you would want your
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00004.flac	amazing i have to say it was one of those scripts that i read and i i got it on an email on my phone and i started to read it on my phone and i ended up reading the whole script on my phone which is kind of quite black mirror
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00005.flac	hyou know where it was going which was great i think you know for audiences of black mirror
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00006.flac	in a good way you know i i think it doesn't just play to your you know sedative kind of television it's it's much more refreshing and as i say it makes you think and and that i really loved i just thought it was completely original so um yeah it was a no
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00007.flac	uh it really did feel like we were working on a film and you know the director oin harris was so great and um in terms of preparation i listened to a
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00008.flac	so heavily in the episode and it's so evocative of that period and then you get into the costumes and the shoulder pads and the big hair and you know my character is quite an extravert so it was fun to play around with that kind of stuff um and it was a really quick shoot it was only about fourteen days
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00009.flac	rehearsal you know so we just sort of had to jump in there were a few sort of dance u
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00010.flac	wr as fun and we did a table read but beyond that it was more like just
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00011.flac	well i think you know like all black mirror episodes i think they're open to interpretation and i think that everybody will bring their own experience and and have their own debate what i love about it is it it does sort of provoke a conversation you know would you go through this experience if you had the option is this potentially possible um but i also think you know it brings up idea
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00012.flac	manufacturer sold or you know all of those kind of things and um and for me those are quite big and deep questions um but at the same time was having these big things to think about it's also really romantic really
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00013.flac	and a really vibrant vibrant episode so i hope people will
id10353_9fnYJcEW0J8_00014.flac	me again it's i guess about the idea of you know having this coming of age story you know and how old is your soul and i think you know you can have somebody you know u with a an old body and a young soul and a a young body and and old soul and and that's fascinating to me in general um so yeah it was it was a really
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00001.flac	i mean i have to confess i hadn't watched black mirror before i got sent this script so i'd heard of it and um i was in london i was doing a play and my agent sent me the script was like you you know
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00002.flac	episode and i was i just had my phone to read it on and sort of ironically enough and very black mirror eske i started to read it on my phone and it was so good i read the whole episode on my phone in about forty five minutes um and it was really a no brainer i mean the script was so beautifully written and charlie brooker as genius so um yeah a hundred percent i was i was
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00003.flac	uh i know it's trically i i totally agree the thing with black mirror is the concepts are so mind blowing that if you know too much it just spoils the experience but um i get to work with mackenzy davis who's a wonderful actress and uh part of the episode is set in the eighties uh and it's romantic um
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00004.flac	i know i was saying earlier you know uh the sort of main character jacket i had was an original eighties vsacy purple seade jacket with tasseles and they embellished it with all these sortof sparkly bits uh but i don't know how i would make that work you know in my
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00005.flac	i know it's bizar i saw brice dalie haward in e a few weeks ago and um
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00006.flac	i'm go go we're both in back mirror you know i  totally fangirled on her and um and then we had to got the lovely experience of going to the toronto film festival at the same time but yeah i mean i've only seen nosedive i haven't seen any of the other episodes i've seen sagenopero obviously but um i'm as excited as anyone
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00007.flac	no we were just both cast in the roles so there was no sort of chance to really get to know each other and it was a very fast uh process we shot it in fourteen days um the seven days in london and seven days in cape town and there wasn't really much time for rehearsal i mean we had a a read through and uh you know we hung out a little bit and got to catch up but um yeah it was just
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00008.flac	jump straight into it but um i have to say you know credit to the writing because you know i think charlie's so great at writing dialoge i really felt like the characters were so clearly drawn on the page that you know im
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00009.flac	he's so approachable i reand i love him to bits he's kind of the the sort of genius you sort of feel like you could be best mates with you know he's very you know down to earth but obviously by his
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00010.flac	you know he was around a lot um but but you know not in an oppressive way he'd pop in um he couldn't come to south africa which i think he was a bit gutted about cause he was doing his screen wype u show so um he was around a bit
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00011.flac	yeah it's really special and it's a real honor to be invited to film festivals as i say we were at toronto earlier in the year and i think especially for something that's going to be on netflixs that maybe most people will see on an ipad or a laptop or in their pajams you know to actually have it have a theatrical life uh like you say because you know the cinematography's so beautiful and the locations are really sweeping and um i think that's really
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00012.flac	o hundred percent and tv is so good and the characters that you get to play you know especially on on netflix as well you know really strong female roles really um groundbreaking i think you know something like black mirror is so refreshing it it doesn't really fit into any sort of regular procederal type box and i think that that's really exciting for people who are doing film cause you don't have to commit
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00013.flac	i in one character for years on end you know you can go in and have a a filmic experience but it's contained and it's also exploring some quite
id10353_jZMAFkAwedU_00014.flac	specialeffects we're all done but i have to say you know i'm so excited about it and i'm completely biosd because i was obsessed with the original animation when i was a kid and i knew all the words it was like my frozen really so um yeah and it's such a beautiful cast you know an amazing unsumble of british actors and american actors as well um yeah i'm really excited for everyone to seei i can't wait to see it when it's finished but um yeah
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00001.flac	ha've created something that um is is so gloriously epiclly fantastical but has some of the most
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00002.flac	looks wonderful and everything you knowal the production values are so so high and and everyone on the show really cares about it and i think that'
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00003.flac	it was a huge privilege it was exactly the kind of role that i'd always wanted to play i mean that's a it's it's roles like that that make you want to become an actor
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00004.flac	i was aware that i had a a responsibility because so many people were a fan of the character from the book
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00005.flac	kind of you but i think it's um you know brien's is is a is a is a classic outsider but uh
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00006.flac	where that's unusual and um and she's been very much
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00007.flac	and she's overcome that by becoming a night um and i think that
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00008.flac	feeling like an outsider is something that everyone can relate to and some people more than others and overcoming it gives gives hope to all of us it certainly gives hope to me you know it's a huge
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00009.flac	it's a huge privilege and and inspirational to to be playing a a part where
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00010.flac	highly different relationship and she's she's put in direct contact with someone
id10356_F9LMw9T4TK8_00011.flac	she's having to not only keep her vow to to captin' stark and fulfill that as best she can but she's
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00001.flac	um what i can tell you about captain pasma is that captain pasmat is the captain of
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00002.flac	she is a member of the first order and part of the dark
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00003.flac	she is a bob a fetstyle character which means that she is not at the forefront of the action but
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00004.flac	it was really extraordinary because i was in uh new york for the season three premiere of game of thrones and i got the phone call
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00005.flac	you have a meeting for star was and so i flew back home after the premire immediately and went to the meeting and
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00006.flac	it took a bit of time to work out because i had a very wonderful problem in that i was sort of filming game of thrones at the same time as star wars was filming so that took a little bit of working out
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00007.flac	game of thrones at the same time as star wars was filming so that took a little bit of working out and both parties both star wars and game of thrones were incredibly generous and worked together to facilitate this amazing opportunity but that did happen over a series of weeks so i did at some points have to entertain the possibility that
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00008.flac	i didn't want to get to upset it it didn't happen but when i knew it was happening
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00009.flac	remember i was very young when i first saw it it seemed so magical because it was at christmas uh i was very young i was about six years old and
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00010.flac	i was just nthraled by it it was so magical it it literally transported me to a different place it took me into a different universe and a universe i wanted to be a part of because it seems
id10356_bknFelWoMcI_00011.flac	different and there was such variety in people there were wookies and there were robots and and robots that you fell in love with and and women with really strong personalities that wouldn't take no for an answer and and sardonic cool men and and
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00001.flac	even started but i do i am afflicted with this terrible
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00002.flac	that a friend of mine rang me and said there's something about you being in an ahbo show and who doesn't actors or not who doesn't wanna be in an ahbo show and i id really wanted to work
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00003.flac	and so i thought oay what's this about and i gogled uh the books and i read a brief sennopsis and then i read about the character and
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00004.flac	play this part and to explore this kind of person and and i never knew it would be as wonderfully successful as it has been but that's very heartening to me because what that says is we wanna see different kinds of people in our entertainment and i do think bran of tarth has
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00005.flac	to me because what that says is we wanna see different kinds of people in our entertainment and i do think
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00006.flac	is a a boba fet style character so that means she is not at the forefront of the action but she certainly makes an
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00007.flac	seen very much on screen so far um so i'm obviously very very excited about that um but what really excites me about the part is that from what we've seen so far uh captain pasma has a particularly bad ass
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00008.flac	important at the neck from the neck up what went on there um but it was interesting to me is that in our in our culture wee really used to seeing female characters and we relate to them due to the way that they are made
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00009.flac	whend we're born but this character we're relating to ju to her choices and her actions first and foremost and i think that's really progressive and modern particularly in a
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00010.flac	do i think i was about six years old it was christmas time it was shown to me by my family and i completely fell in love with it i i fell in love the with the fact there was this
id10356_gOafsGWloeU_00012.flac	everything for me but obviously it's our foundation story of good against evil but there's something very magical about it and i
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00001.flac	so much in a teenager's life almost everything in a teenager's life is
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00002.flac	in such a reasonable way so blown out of proportion um every little thing that happens is such a huge event in your life at that
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00003.flac	everything that happens to nadin means so much and i think that's what pushes the boundaries is that everything
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00004.flac	that were so similar to nadenes and it felt very weird going in there and being like i went through this
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00005.flac	went through this or something similar and it's just a weird sort of vulnerable state i felt i i was in because i went in there and i was like this is so similar to to to what i've experienced in life and to what
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00006.flac	all she weares her feelings her heart her everything on her sleeve
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00007.flac	and even when you know she's trying not to let whatever it is get to her you know how she's really feeling and there's something so
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00008.flac	refreshing about seeing someone that just like feels like you know there's so much that she goes through with so many different people in this movie from her best friend to her
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00009.flac	the ultimate best friend relationship it's the relationship where
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00010.flac	if you're not in the same room you're most likely texting or on the phone or on face time with that person talking about what you're doing or not saying anything at all
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00011.flac	is the he's just he's the only person that just pretends to show any interest in my conversation um
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00012.flac	he listens to her and he welcomes her uh to an extent um but is so unfazed by anything she has to say and that just keeps her like on her toes and keeps her thinking of any possible thing she can say for that shock value um and ththat's what i guess one of the things i love so much about nadinas just she just doesn't
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00013.flac	hatred that nadene has for this person that she looks at and sees as absolutely
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00014.flac	got everything from beyond the looks he's got the grades he's got the school loving him every person walks by he he walks by in the hallways turns to him and gives him a high five or gives him shows him attention and love and i walk down and people snicker and look at me up and down and we're
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00015.flac	incredible because i'm able to just have a conversation with kely and see in her eyes
id10357_5ad_KUPOvLc_00016.flac	passionate she is and see where everything comes from um and just in conversation it's been so helpful
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00001.flac	no so i went in and i said you guys pull up that track pull it up i said to you stop go again that's why i stop because i saw something so they pull up the track
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00002.flac	right you can hear this insane like breath over the mice right before you hear me say oh my god wait go again it is the most i get the chills every time i hear it it's the it scares the
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00003.flac	lemon rose and frank sonartr's old apartments oso am i bein marilanman ro breathing on
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00004.flac	i guess with on the acting side just sort of facing rejection in a way i feel like you can kind of
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00005.flac	for years of just reading for the same people that you think oh my god this could be the one and then it's like no it's not you were never right in the first place and i think like getting that's almost like getting bood like yo
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00006.flac	that  there's just a the level of vlnerability that's like through the roof and i i i definitely have felt that similarly but i've never been
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00007.flac	so for i did my i made my first movie when i was thirteen i started auditioning at nine
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00008.flac	for all those years i would go in and i would audition and i didn't know any different i made a couple student films i gues stred a couple sicoms i didn't really know the lay of the land of making a ful length movie or or really any
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00009.flac	i obviously then went back and and started auditioning for other parts again and i had the hardest time for the longest time because i realized what a difference
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00010.flac	a location other actors directors that know how to direct you and then you go into a room with white walls and five people staring at you and you're reading off a piece of paper and it's like why can't i do this so it
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00011.flac	i obviously then went back and and started auditioning for other parts again and i had the hardest time for the longest time because i realized what a difference haran makeup makes
id10357_FXflMpLN_B0_00012.flac	a location other actors directors that know how to direct you and then you go into a room with white walls and five people staring at you and you're reading off a piece of paper and it's like why can't i do this so it it definitely was a i mean it's not easy it's so not easy but
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00001.flac	and it goes on like everything funny story the other day um i was in new york city and i have an obsession with cereal and so i had a box of cereal of a brand that like i normally eat but it was just a different it was like an off brand of the brand that i eat and uh
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00002.flac	in between like i was doing like phone interviews in in between interviews i would just like eat a ton of it right and um like a couple hours later
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00003.flac	slike blew up and my face got really swollen then i was like what is happening to me this is like who am i um turns out there were nuts in the cereal and my face just like i have
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00004.flac	themselves uh and i've always wanted to come here especially knowing that this is where they're from uh so to have it
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00005.flac	to be here because of the music and to have the music playing here is just t
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00006.flac	aside from doing what like i love uh i love
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00007.flac	go down to the beach and just like sit outside for hours in the sun
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00008.flac	and just by the water and just relax and kind of not do much um
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00009.flac	t that's ithat's an interesting question i would probably say either like a great bol or or a
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00010.flac	i um i haven't made the last movie i made was pitch perfect two and that was
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00011.flac	bepen a minute um so that was the last movie i made and since then i have been focussing on music um my next movie uh is in october so i will continue to to make movies and make music so we'll see how we'l
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00012.flac	okay so i'm gonna make it like i'm trying to get you to guess what i'm doing okay but i
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00013.flac	uh well i would try my best to play it cool i don't know how well i would do but
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00014.flac	i would just try and have like a normal conversation i guess right i don't know what do you do
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00015.flac	and i just i'm looking forward to one thing i love so much about making music and recording music is that it almost it's almost a never ending process even though like you eventually make anep
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00016.flac	project you move on and you either never see it again or you have no idea what happens it's out of your hands um and with music it's like i started about six seven months ago and it's so completely different
id10357_uN7lxiHhMNE_00017.flac	continuing to make music and and see how it envolves and see how it changes but um eventually i'll put some out no this
id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00001.flac	um i think there e lot of michael moor haters out there because they were trained at an early age to be michaelmor haters and i'm not i i don't mea that faciciusly i mean there as an element
id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00002.flac	the um the idea of being pro america to a certain group of people means never questioning it which is the most unhealthy view you can possibly have there was this american protectionism which is if you try to chip away at our facade
id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00004.flac	not the person who's totally full of shit and and when you're in a position where your industry what you do for a living in michel more's case is you make the case that we're living behind a fasad this is
id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00005.flac	two years ago when he was on cn did a an expose on how crappy the american healthcar system is and now he's protecting it from the fasfaest obama it's absurd it's sales and he's trying to get past the vaneer of sales whene you do that the people who sell the stuff are gonna come after you and they're gonna come after you hard and they're gonna motivate people who are dum and uneducated and love living that way to get to to
id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00006.flac	um i'm on a stand up touer and then uh i have a new series but i can't talk about it yet which is very exciting um and then i'm recording a standup album this week and

id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00008.flac	to make fun of myself um i quite frankly i don't think uh celebrities are good points for lampooning unless their behavior uh
id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00010.flac	make their living trying to be famous making fun of people who are already famous it's for for being famous it's the biggest it's like pop eating itself so uh

id10358_QBiI2XiJmEg_00016.flac	absolutely cause at least it's non fiction at least there's something substantive about it you know wha mean e ou gona o watch the king of pop docamenary on msbc again seriously do we not know what happened with michal jackson that's the thing you live your life in public and then people want ta see a documentary about i

id10360_aTx3dzQRenY_00002.flac	i i i just feel so lucky to be able to go to work every day and do something that i
id10360_aTx3dzQRenY_00003.flac	nthre's comedy in it but when when that happened it was it was ar it was a big it was a big blow as well
id10360_aTx3dzQRenY_00005.flac	for which was the the people that were really good fans that when we were when we were actually in our heyday
id10360_aTx3dzQRenY_00006.flac	giwork was um done with re and they had a aaan
id10360_aTx3dzQRenY_00007.flac	group make sure we were all looking at the same flacs cause otherwise that 's gonna look a bit doge and also
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00001.flac	her ego is fuled by her twitter followers she has like her
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00002.flac	more twitter followers than the population of venezala or something like that and she's having a bit of a breakdown and she's making a comeback she's a pop star she's making a comeback in two thousand and fifteen and um yeah her name is poppy and she's great fun to play she's a
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00003.flac	yeah it's one of the things that really drew me initially to the project because of the parelels and
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00004.flac	my life right now and yeah i found that really really interesting um hopefully i'm not as um divaesue as she is um cause she's a proper diva but um yeah i like to think that i'm not quite as um a head case as she is
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00005.flac	famous uh pop stars and to kind of um get
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00006.flac	and yeah i looked at britny spers and also um
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00007.flac	um yeah across the board really um i think sort of everybody out there has had one sort of
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00008.flac	hit's um it's amazing to be working um at the langham one of which i love working in the west end in town cause it's so convenient um and two it's just  a prestigious amazing posh hotel that is just lovely to
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00009.flac	be working in and also we get to use one of the rooms is our dressing room so that's also quite nice um butabove all our space that we perform in is um an absolute treat it's a really really intimate space and
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00010.flac	z and it's got a cabare feel and it's dark and it's kind of got cool sexy lighting and yeah it's a really really um lovely lovely setting and it's there you know and you don't have to sort of
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00011.flac	and um yeah and it's there you don't have to kind of make things up and make a set it's just all
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00012.flac	um i my main thing that i i find really interesting about the project is that i hope the audience feel literally like a fly on the wall when they're watching
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00013.flac	that really really translates i'm sure it does because we are pretty much on top of the audience it's like ah tin of sardines basically um i don't quite know how our audience manages to get in the rooms following our our play because our room is almost twice as big
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00014.flac	um on top of that i hope that they take away um a nice nice experience um you know we've got a
id10360_yBdIauv-5IA_00015.flac	few different elements in there wee got music and um different time periods the audience get taken on a journey throughout the hotel um and also from two thousand and fifteen right back into the past so um it's a really interesting concept and i'm really happy

id10360_yVWutBwaJME_00020.flac	some it its about giving them the music that they listened to when they were growing up you know lot of the fans have said that it's the soundtrack to their childhood which is lovely to hear and yeah it's about getting them traout there again and enaibling them to come out and remember what it was what you know what the world was like wen they we igh years old and reminice and um have a night of

id10362_JbbZ8at5OF8_00009.flac	hws a musical guy but he wasn't a musician and my mom i think probably had definitely had some musicians on her side but they all lived they all came from new york so

id10362_JbbZ8at5OF8_00020.flac	i i at's he last thing on my mind the first thing on my mind is to try to actually do something this project is really becomeing
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00001.flac	new york right outside of new york actually and i heard that it was gonna hit on a saturday and i was concerned about the welfare of my family so but i couldn't get in touch with anybody cause all the phone lines were down well  the storm kinda came and went and missed new orleands it didn't really hit new orleans the next day i turned on the news and the levies i don't know if you guys no that new orleans is shaped like a like a bowl and most of the residential area is in that lower part it's actually twenty feet below
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00002.flac	and you know all of that water came in and just filled up this bow um and it and
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00003.flac	alking about people don't realize how big new orlands is you tell about hundreds of thousands of homes and and and
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00004.flac	hundreds of thousands of people no it was terrible i mean like you you found yourself in these my my aunt jessiy and uncle john my aunt jessie's probably seventy one my uncle john's probably eighty one and they they were n
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00005.flac	the they're they had to come reskue hm by e boat next thng you know they're on the interstate trying to hitch high
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00006.flac	yeah and they have money i mean the people who didn't have money uh oh i could go on and on about the things i saw it was very very confusing must have been real confusing
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00007.flac	i really you know new york is great uh san francisco's great there's a lot of wonderful places in the states but there's no place like new
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00008.flac	again i i hope people if they do decide maybe for holiday to go to the states that they visit cause not only is it still a wonderful place but new orlans really needs that they need that influx of of tourism
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00009.flac	well we had a pianow in the house and i started playing much like a lot of children do they started plinking around a uh when i was about three years old but i don't think i was doing
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00010.flac	tin i'm doing anything remarkable now but as time went on uh i started getting lessons and
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00011.flac	an they have music in the afternoon so my parents would take me down and i playd and when i was nine years old i did my first record and then i recorded my second record the one you

id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00014.flac	because we did two shows on a wenesday one thuresday night one friday night two saturday and two sunday so i had two two days off i had monday and tuesday just to sort a decompress and spent ti with my
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00015.flac	t weeks ad i said i gotta burn out at some point i can't maintain this enthusiasm
id10362_r-xJUB0A4ok_00016.flac	was was uh has nothing to do with the song uh and then i'm bout to do a film with uh renae alweger which i haven't even metter yet so i'm excited
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00002.flac	uh i i i think uh this this guy has no no filter at all um and that's what was so fun to play uhuhuhabout uh this character but i i try to use my filter as much as i
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00003.flac	not not to change the content of what i'm saying but just to make sure that you know i think being polihte is is an important vertue
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00004.flac	to jery to allom lesa cod the whole cast really um is an extraordinarily talented group of people and it was amazing to show up to work and
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00005.flac	and you know have all of these people around it was a very sort of an energetic set and uh
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00006.flac	good spirited set uh you know cathy bates being there i mean any day that you wake up and you know you're goinna work with somebody will not somebody like but you're gongna work with cathy bats is is
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00008.flac	scene with such a great girl and a great actress such as hilery uh was something i i'll never forget i mean it was aa
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00009.flac	you know i don't really have a base bal team but i you know cause i grew up in new orleans and we don't have a team
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00010.flac	do um i write more emails than i do handwritten letters but yeah i've i've written quite a few letters to my wife i i i i like receving letters you know my dad's always been a big letter writer my mother was a letter writer and i like the way that feels you know
id10362_uPerly0ah9o_00011.flac	there was some down time while they were relighting something and i went over to the piano and played and and had a had a good time it was it was
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00001.flac	more and even better uh this time around so it was it was more of an excitement
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00002.flac	yeah yeah no uh i mean all all that is uh to me i look at i its just part of
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00003.flac	for me i always try like i don't go around wearing you know magnises ah jacket all the time you
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00004.flac	en ther's something there that i think both of them can't really quite understand uh yet
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00005.flac	uh i don't think that's like the reason why it' atractive but it's like this mystery that he wants to uh get to know and from there
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00006.flac	slowly aske questions and  figure a person out and i think what he was seeing was was intriging and
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00007.flac	um i think it's different from what you've seen n the trectory of of season one but it goes back to see uh
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00008.flac	you know the writers it was more of him try ing to figure out how different tactics to try and get to talk to
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00009.flac	to uh pool as much information uh about the character nd about the world and and there comes a time with
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00010.flac	it's not just about the world is ending but about the relationships which is i i think what we're really getting
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00011.flac	misscommunication as well so you you will see that with not everyone's just holding hands and hoping
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00012.flac	i think with with magnus is what i find really interesting about him is that he does know so much and he he usually will know how things will play out but he will allow them
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00013.flac	special effectswise and and both of us kinda meet in the middle and with that iiit is playing around with with the
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00014.flac	not not within the lines but how the scene gets played out ase so i look at movement that way as well but um so there's variations and i i think they they chose the
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00015.flac	alec is going through a lot um right now i uh
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00016.flac	and i think the important part is that parovatis kind of messed up with uh alicant jase that
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00017.flac	and with with with everything going on the institute and and his and his
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00018.flac	pushing him down and saying like he can't do certain things i think it's messing with him so with when magnis
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00019.flac	objects that mean so much to him that kinda come about and you'll you'll get a lot more backstory on it and itl
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00020.flac	uh a uh a deeper look into how that effects everyone
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00021.flac	r like okay well that had its window and it's done and but to see people
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00022.flac	pryou know itso or even if they're not in if they'remarriedby then it's ill a story that's really
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00023.flac	how do i get back into that without like fully prepping because you know you bounce out a project i kind a just like let it go
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00024.flac	i i think for me it also helps with conversations you know you wanna multie task but ata
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00025.flac	utilizes dance in the way that i i i love you know  and i love and other things i'll just stay as like anoteview
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00026.flac	and love love dance watching it but uh i'm excited for these uh couple projects that are coming up that i'll definitely be
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00027.flac	so it's it's been nice to have a lot you know have a lot of them kind a follow in my career and and i no what what's been great it's like oh man i you know i wasn't i would never have
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00028.flac	a little more about oh what did magnas d like whowere his relationships that he had before uh his friendships and the mentor uh uh when he was a mentoreo he still is and i think that's what's what's really fun and he
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00029.flac	in the season one and i think that's what's funa that's what taughd and derner
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00030.flac	they do they're really trying to draw out the relationships um and not just uh the romantic ones but the ones outside of it just cause it's um that that that's what that's what's really that's what really uh gives you an inside
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00031.flac	this i mean he's he's used to kind of maybe feeling a little bit of an outsider as as
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00032.flac	uh his his powers and also his confidence but um
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00033.flac	the what he brings to the simon role is um is really special and every
id10363_FIp8x6OY6WI_00034.flac	that people all over the world are watching it and someody ls should be sleeping or studying or being and s
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00001.flac	and seeing that for magnis like even being n in that party sequence and
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00002.flac	e're like sometimes reshooting certain certain episode's a we kinda lose track of which episode things uh that happened in certain episodes like
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00003.flac	easy to obtain something that you know the props department does a really good job of making these props and  i i think they did a brilliant job with the sarahplay thit's just like
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00004.flac	of art ai o like to hang and even you know i'm not i don't play a shadow hunter but just seeing that and being
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00005.flac	a lot i ean there's gonna be a lot of malic there's gonna be um a lot
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00006.flac	challenging uh things that that that will happen just like with any you know any relationship that
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00007.flac	the mess that's happening i think with within the down world and and and the shadow world and um
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00008.flac	that that i think plays really well with these almost they're althey're basically opposites you know um and they're completely opposite and the it's like opposites attract and ther finding out like why that happens and i think we get to see
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00009.flac	oh i'm not i try i did this other interview where they had us try and do it as fast as we could with like no
id10363__0VU5sCa7Pc_00010.flac	other interview where they had us try and do it as fast as we could with ike
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00001.flac	i think you know you you especially from where it was back even from you know when when film and television started it's it's gotten a lot better obviously but it's now making sure those voices are are they're
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00002.flac	there the writer's room and and execs and nd the directors are are are able to understand you know the voices that need to be heard
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00003.flac	e stoll a lot of work in that sense but i'm really happy to just you know see a lot of familiar faces on television
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00004.flac	and uh ii is also you know been around the block and and done things whether id be you know an
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00005.flac	uh the so  it's it's a really fun character that that that that has so many layers and and and and i can go so many different directions with it so i really
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00006.flac	well totally it's a lot darker an and and we we're also uh
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00007.flac	wellso you know we're filling in where the books kind of left a lot of space in so there's a lot of u uh uh uh places wherere gona look deeper into the background of of of our main characters and also bring in new characters that people from the book lovers have fell in love with and i think even people who haven't read the book willfall in love with just cause it brings it strikes a a a kind of
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00008.flac	uh uh a jults up the the the the kind of the um the storyline that that's that was going through in the
id10363_tMIjFefXiQQ_00009.flac	what's what's nice about the show is um is everyone is asome everyone is is really sweet and aand and nice and and you know wants to make the show the best as possible um you know

id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00003.flac	later a review was a hit now you can't hver manufacture o a a hit tor either have one you don't at that point i wanted to go to university and get a proper education for myself it was my father who was much more um

id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00005.flac	and uh sotho i just carried on and i just carred on working i didn't go to drama schooli
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00006.flac	to im meet a lot of young people these days aal you kno coming after yun uni or or even don't really know what to do at eighteeand i go like start working now i think work experiences parramon and just doing it you learn a
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00007.flac	acting have an imagination cause all you're doing is being a big
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00008.flac	very volerable when it comes to acting and be very emotional but at the same time when you're well known you have to be very um have a
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00009.flac	a strong armer and make sure that you don't believe too much of about what other people
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00010.flac	ultimatel yourself employed you're gonna have to work out if you're te kind of character who will sut that kind of
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00011.flac	life and have the dicippline to deal with it cause t's not whenyou're working that's hard it's when ou're not working and you gota have ohave a
id10371_6SHP5C3yyM0_00012.flac	anyone don't you know punish yourself don't spend too much on yesterday that was a good co i you know don't waist too much
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00001.flac	mm was um that was in a way that was the first time that i was well superficially different ithat i was um not english i was no
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00002.flac	it was i mean i like doing something personaly from my and i think ie like most
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00003.flac	well i personaly prefere parts that require me to change even if it's a superficial sort of physical change and um
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00004.flac	oh they they have not so much in the english patient but in other sort of period costume dramas they sort of say so and sos playing the had on a boan
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00005.flac	actress usually kcate winsles or something like that you know i've hit thirty so i think the d adwell big it well i'm ean aging ag i'e i read
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00006.flac	cause i i prefered playing um i think the parts will get better i hope
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00007.flac	it's a nova scotiaaccent the whole story takes place in cape britain and uh the accent is very od because one um well it's a higbrid of sort of mixtures of canadian sounds and irish sounds all hof the all of scottish decent so god knows why they sound irish but they do and so it can sound if you're doing it right it can sound as if you're doing two accents badly but that's if you're doing it right
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00008.flac	floted you know half way across the world in the accent from time to time but uh it sounds a sort of authentic cause it sounds so wildly
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00009.flac	i i had i had difficulty for instance understanding what thel i said during that scene but um it is in
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00010.flac	sort of i have a great fun here probably because i don't believe her so
id10371_G5AlHTPuquM_00011.flac	uh it's uh now i love it i mea they'e dfferent parts of america i do it you knowthe
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00001.flac	make it seem as if it's it's original and it's a brainwave and newly mintit and make it
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00002.flac	aclich not seem aclic like seem instantly make it seem as if it's it's original and it's a brainwave and newly minti and make it fresh so
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00003.flac	pumpkan why pumpkin so then it was like well she's obviously improvizing let's do that so she got ta hav lots of vegetables and maybe the pumpkin isn't
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00004.flac	point when it's almost does not turn into the pumpkin at the basically the idea was i just thought maybe she's aratic maybe she's not
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00005.flac	necessarily the most accomplished or efficient fairy godmother she's she's she was described in the thing as being a hundred and seventy thousand years old so i said well she's going to have some sort of memory loss ad to that you know she's gota she's got a lot of pressure
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00006.flac	dedline to make very quick so we're the pressure of that and then also
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00007.flac	on to the set because it took us so long to get ready both me and lilly  so and when lilly got into the dress finally that i
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00008.flac	she's part designer to um it took us so long to get into
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00009.flac	underneath my skirts and switchd me on because i was actually a walking lamp i had four hundred eledelights
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00010.flac	and i had to be switched on for each take and sometimes hir was my function an be ga cch
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00011.flac	up and uh odovoce i had a little bulgin up my sleeve up my up my skirts it was it was a really different kind of
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00012.flac	the kids are you know gonna be entertained now i can just lie back and relax and you know not have o y board you know what do i do now
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00013.flac	i mean not on my ball but you know being pested by the kids but in fact they go they come out really enchanted
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00014.flac	and you know and interested everyone knows the story and somehow when ken said oh
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00015.flac	it's classic but i think there's a maturity of character un
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00016.flac	umand a lot of messages tat are totally appropriate to twenty fifteen as it were as they were appropriate to any age that you live in i if you have got the gus
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00017.flac	sadness and grieef and basically a lot of crapp happening to you if you got the gut
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00018.flac	and remain corageous and decide to not be imbitterd and twisted and not be a
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00019.flac	disappointed or angry but but remain open and grow
id10371_zpBmE9J8AQw_00020.flac	then you can choose that but you have a choice in life how to react or
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00001.flac	one of the moments i really liked best was at james lafferde's charity baskeball game um betheny joy lens asked me to sing the national anthem with her and so you know i used to sing the nationl anthem in my home town when i grew up and my dad was like the commissioner or lower loud little len base ball and so i'd
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00003.flac	so i sang it with her um and then that morning my best friend elizabeth arnwa who playes shelly on our show showed up she's an amazing singer so she joined in our little group so t
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00004.flac	was me and and two of my very good friends getting to perform for our fans and it was just something really different than what we do on our show um but still getting to
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00005.flac	i had on the show um i have to say this year a lot of my storyline has been revolving
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00006.flac	he was played by mabar who is by far the nicest man on the plan at
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00007.flac	rscene i think i'd done like a spoop shower scene before wering like a shower cap it was definitely not sexy and  this is like my my first
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00008.flac	and he plays whidy he's always asking for hair touch ups and always demanding new wardrobe no um i think i mean we'v all have been together so long
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00009.flac	how do you say this we don't guard ourselves around each other so if someone's acting like a baby which it's usually me uh none of us are afraid
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00010.flac	four years later which is great because what's happened over the course of our show is that everyone's become a good guy you know every bad guy you've seen the justification as to why he's a bad guy and you feel sorry for them so what i would love to happen is to come back four years
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00011.flac	producers on the show um down ta wilmington called sothern gothic films and
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00012.flac	ourgo is to to keep film and to keep projects in north carolina cause it really is such an auwsome place to shoo and i feel really lucky that i've gotten to spend at least four years down there um and so yeah we've got projects under development that you know we're we're looking for financing right now and i'm learning a lot about the independent film world and i've goten a really great education both at mtv and at one tree hill so i feel like i can utilize that
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00013.flac	icover my favorite tv show until i was older um and thit's freexin keeks i think jedp tow is
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00014.flac	and actually in the time that we've had off since shooting we've been watching the boxset of is other
id10373_AfkWfzjxVOY_00015.flac	caught watching top model now and then um i love the drama of it all i love
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00001.flac	well you know at any time white collor does a
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00002.flac	it's go bigger go home um and i think the that perhaps this season has been a little more dramatic um i think the tention between
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00003.flac	then the first two seasons there are feelings invested in one another you know friendship carries a lot of weight and so um the choices that
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00004.flac	or peter um and so there's a lot of consequences this season and i think we're gonna see that ind the
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00005.flac	one that's a type a and you're a type a and youre wildly attracted to each other there's gonna be atention um i think there's gonna be a little bit of competition
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00006.flac	and there's also gonna be a lot of heat and so they certainly are gonna continue to pat ucross paths because they've been doing it for years um and so it's
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00007.flac	very good time together and um i think our characters have fun together my character allows the audience to see a side of him that was only hinted at when he was with kate you know he had a domestic side with kate that uh you only saw in a little tiny flashback and so my job is to show the audience what they wanna see of nele you know the suave charming kind
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00008.flac	teneal um date ken if you will so um you know i
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00009.flac	i think the way we left it where sara lets him know thet
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00010.flac	um we see sara bing protective of him and and clearly that indicates that she still cares for him what
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00012.flac	he's been doing a very good job of gracefully navigating this
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00013.flac	and um my nanny and i used to watch it together and we used to joke you know oh i wanna b
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00014.flac	cause the usa tagolin's character's welcum um so when this audition came around it was like you know i wasn't really
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00015.flac	here is uh a facilitater for the other characters you know sara opens up a door for you to see a different side of neale a different side of
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00016.flac	she came in rough and hard and stoic um and
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00017.flac	we've gotten to see her break those defense meconisms down a little bit and i
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00018.flac	um the breakup sceen between her and neale was important because i don't know if even neaile knew how committed sara was to the relationship i maybe even it surprised her
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00019.flac	you know i she might have gotten just caught up um and taken by surprise at how disappointed she was when she found out about the treasure and so it would be
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00020.flac	be honest with each other no secrets and and creative friendship
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00021.flac	maybe turns into something um you know if they're not together as a couple but still in each other's world him having to watch her date other people or her having to watch him date other people
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00022.flac	tha this show is that there's always that underline subplot that goes throughout the episodes but each episode is like great big huge fantastic stories so it's nice the jexposition of the the big storyline that's about the case per episode and then kind of this underlying thing that colors how the characters
id10373_Sd89So_Asyk_00023.flac	the for the foks hat have been watching since day one and it's also you know a payoff for people that might casually just tun in for the first time you know
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00001.flac	um i think that wat was hard for me is that we didn't know all summer uh while we had our hiatus who he was gonna pick and realistically
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00002.flac	eight he's gonna get bord again and he's gonna do it all over again som
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00003.flac	well yeah and this is somebody who i wasn't totally familiar with but then the more i studied him i was like oh my god i can't believe this is like john do he's coming i's gonna be great so he shows up and he
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00004.flac	became this great big part of my heart and then you kow a she passed away it affected
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00005.flac	asor to find out what she was like at patein's age is really interesting and um and yeah it's cool to have them
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00006.flac	cause there are definitely the kids in the camp that like hate hateen they're like uh man she ust gets alore
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00007.flac	an she's the worst and she's a terrible friend and and pet's pretty much a villin but the great
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00008.flac	villan ist they don't think they're the villan they think everyything they're doing is justified a rotally right so i would love to be able to play the dan part and uh and apply that that same mind sat
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00009.flac	sens asome and we've gotten to kind of stay outside of the madness for six years now and my whole family lives here and so i get to be like normal when i'm not
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00010.flac	up to me and she's like i have to tell you something i don't wan it to freak you out and i think she's gonna tell me i know where you live because that freaks me out you know
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00011.flac	so this girl liks up she 's like have to tell you something said i saw you get in in your car the other day and i saw flesh spirit in the passengers set of your car and i'm like
id10373_YHZ63r51udM_00012.flac	spirit sitting in my passengers seat and she describes verbatam the woman that haunts my house i have pictures of this woman she describes i mean to a t what this woman looks like and i'm just
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00001.flac	w precisely that actually i think um well that's one of the reasons it was definitely um um different for me in that it's not a really dramatic piece you know i love doing drama but it was definitely an opportunity for me
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00002.flac	you never know what's gonna happen tomorrow and um and i could i could certainly relate to holy trying to find her
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00003.flac	we yes we did freedom writers  came out this year as well and um we um
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00004.flac	girl and i wanna show this side of you and um and neither of us really
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00005.flac	thought of pees i love you as the next thing um and then
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00006.flac	you know worner brother' kept saying what d youwanna do and i just kept saying peace i love you and then richard had written it so it was kind of just a natural
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00007.flac	bwhat a what a great opportunity to to to experience it like that and get to stay for a
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00008.flac	i did i i did drink yes i'm leaving for thefor irland tomorrow for the preneer there
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00009.flac	really fun he's um you know he he got into the business a little later in life so
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00010.flac	he's really playful and that he doesn't have kind of any expectations about how anything's supposed to be and he just kind of finds his way and um there's a lot of playfulness and
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00011.flac	i'm so lucky you know you don't get movies like that anymore really um and to to to have such a strong cast you know around around me and to collaborate with them uh you know it was it was it was not only fun it
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00012.flac	oh you should warn us so that we can think about it um okay um il
id10374_BgwhzEfL_IM_00013.flac	great love story and again another movie i think about uh that really
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00001.flac	so interesting to hear you say that ait's the second time i've heard nominated for an accademy
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00002.flac	um it means to me that i'm being recognized for my work in a movie that i'm very proud to be a part of um it means that people are
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00003.flac	really being drawn to the movie and um recognizing the importance of the movie and it's very
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00004.flac	cas obviously opened a lot of career opportunities for me um i'm getting the chance to work with a lot of talented people um which is very very exciting and that's that's also one of the plusses about being nominated for an oscar and getting that that that high acolade is that you get those opportunities more
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00005.flac	you know i've absolutely with with other job opportunities but just even across the board without even job opportunities i've had people call me and write me directors producers actresses people i don't even know reaching out and
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00006.flac	um how the movieh's moved them and the performance has inspired them and um
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00007.flac	i can't like i can't even tell you how that makes me feel um to have that much support and the public the public comes up to me i was just talking about this with one of my friends they stop me on
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00008.flac	whose work i admire and and someone who i i admire as a human being i mean she's been around a long time and um
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00009.flac	and so admirable i mean she's an amazing talent and to i think be outwardly honest with those
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00010.flac	in a in a business that i think that a lot of people talk about you know where people aren't supportive of one another and they're out to get one another i think that um her being so open about that just shows the type of human being she
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00011.flac	and they offered it to me i knew that if i couldn't pass as a boy that i didn't wanna do the movie i knew i'd be doing it a grave injustice i mean this was someone's life
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00012.flac	you know and um i wanted to be able to tell the story in a way that one brandon would be proud of and in a way
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00013.flac	in  witch brandon lived i mean brandon passe as a boy and people believed he was a boy um so i uh
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00014.flac	it's uh when i see that i just i think about brandon so much that it was someone brandon was someone who was living his life the way he wanted and um this movie i think means so much to me it's a love story and it's astor a coming of age story and it's it's a movie that is about following your dreams and i think that that's why people are relating to it and when i
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00015.flac	mattere i don't think she thought of it in those types of things like a'm i gonna get caught or i think that she he was just saying this is how i wanna live this was what feels good this was what brings me the most joy and i have so much
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00016.flac	help but  but but really the passing wasthe biggest uh help on for me the most instrumental passing on
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00017.flac	um what it's like to live as a tranjenderd person
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00018.flac	a gay and lesbean in in this world that's full of
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00019.flac	mwas made for under two million dollars we all did it for the it was a labor of love we did it because of the importance of it and that we all wanted to be a part of it no one was getting paid to do this movie and um it
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00020.flac	uh you know being the underdogs and getting this this attention is it's just thrilling and it's exciting and i think it um speaks a lot about where we're
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00021.flac	well meryel streep is my acting rolle model i've always admired her she is my acting god and i've said that before i think she's just absolutely incredible i almost get disinspired when i
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00022.flac	i i i don't thougkt there's a word to define it i i don't know what it is it's a quality and a luminescence and a realness that she brings and all these characters that she develops they're so real and i don't know how she does it i watch it and i
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00023.flac	how are you doing that you believe that that is that person nd that when you meet her you're gonna meet be meeting these characters
id10374_Dou-0d6tgqM_00024.flac	i'm doing a movie called the gift um it's a supporting role and a and an amazing onsamble cast sam ramy is directing kate blanchet uh gevannero bc uh greg kanneer michael jeter keano rives kate homes i mean it's an amazing cast um it's a murder mystery it's very fun i'm i'm i'm filming
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00001.flac	tat sorrymaybe we should just thak about you're gonna have i'm just doing this you have to say that to me three
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00002.flac	this was extensive there's there's a lot of different accounts that you can read about this this time and and and the settlers of this country i say four mothers because like you said this movie um i believe deals with something very different than we've seen in film
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00003.flac	you know this is a fictional movie yet it as almost a true story in a way because this is a true account of what we've we've dealt with  the resilliency of of
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00004.flac	to understand truely what these people experienced dayan and day out as they traversed across the state
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00005.flac	really set the stage for why these people can lose their minds and really lose sense of of any type of
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00006.flac	and and they didn't have the werewith all to be able to handle um that uhas as we do
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00007.flac	ordinary someone first of all he's a vetteran in this business he's been doing this for so long and he knows the ropes inside and out and so for me to get the
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00008.flac	who's who's the director an cosstar working so closely that kind of symbiotic thing that you hof um and
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00009.flac	you're here and it it's i didn't want it to be over it was it was
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00010.flac	well i think funding any film can be a challenge um but that might be more of a question for tommy lee only because i wasn't a producer on this movie um but i can just say thank you to all those people for funding it so that we could get this this little movie that could up and and and running i think it
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00011.flac	it's um gives people a nice  choice besides going to a
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00012.flac	it gives people a nice slice of life and as an audience member um when i go and see movies i like to have those options i wantnta see a slice of life and and and
id10374_WzZL_EwJPDE_00013.flac	uh comedy and the big movies i want my my choices so it's nice that we're out tthere
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00001.flac	thethe script was was great the script was kind of it was amazing story to read but it
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00002.flac	went to chatham for research to um and the the place whe it took place and they still they still have i kind of like a museum piece that the actual thirty six five hundred boat that uh that they rescued all the guys on that day well it's  still tied to chatham
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00003.flac	that that would even be a legal twelve monbt alone having
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00004.flac	no no and what i find so fascinating is how humble these guys ware is like i've listened to a few interviews with berne webbert and he
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00005.flac	he he always mentions it being like an act of god or or most like it was fate or an act of god you know totally taking the responsibility out of his hands which um i just think that's i mean it's so humbling to see to hear someone who is so humble and but has achieved
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00006.flac	yeah it was no the only thing that was hard about looking into christ's eyes actually is because his eyes were so blue
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00007.flac	um first rehearsal we both kind of immediately fell in love with the relationship between berney and miriam because just the idea of that they met over the phone
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00008.flac	knew what each other looked like and and had such an such a particulaly miriam had such a instinct towards the relationship and it um you know wand they woul they would
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00009.flac	yeah so i met and i was privileged enough to get my to around chatham was from uh patty who is miriam and berne's daughter who um miriam was quite quite uh private apparently so
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00010.flac	liked to kind of to to to share that y id listening to her own voice um um but patty just the even you know an she i don't think patty quite understands how much help she gave me because she was just telling me basical things about her mum but it's just the the words that
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00011.flac	to explain someone that's so close to them just mean so much and after meeting patty i really did the character of miriam totally like poped off the
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00012.flac	stedy kind of progression i feel very lucky that i've managed i've had chance to play
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00013.flac	interesting women that i've been completely intrigued by um i think for me i when i played bonne from bonniy and clid i felt i sort of felt like the years before that had been like my
id10376_HZ1boEyPgQ4_00014.flac	sort of a the sort of learning the manipulation and so and and so i didn't feel i after i finished that mone series i was like
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00001.flac	um it's i mean it's such an epic feet that
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00002.flac	the scale of the of the boat and the managing to save so many people it kind of it i feel like it's quite a life afirming
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00003.flac	yeah i mean this is a story that i hadn't had not previously been aware of and i
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00004.flac	the kind of the morrals and the values represented by um
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00005.flac	um by bernie weber and by the by the coast gards it's it's it's t you know thhearing bernie weber afterwards after the events he's so humble and
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00006.flac	kno so this is just his job and this is just what he's out there to do and
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00007.flac	of loyalty to your job and um you know bravery in the face of danger and the the altruism in being able to put your life at stake to save other people and uh and know so strongly that that is what's right and to be able to stick
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00008.flac	yeah i mean hugely i had i sort of had no real nowlege of the of the coast gard before hand and i kind of ah you know always nivly assumed it was quite a sort of just off shore thing and to kind of
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00009.flac	i mean it was stepping on the on the thirty six five hundred itself cause they still have the the the actual boat tied up at chattham pir and it's tiny it's like ite you sort of thing
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00010.flac	this can ft a handful of people it's like how and how the hel do you save like how tethe hell des nearly forty people fit on it and in such stormy wheatherand
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00011.flac	the the sets were amazing i mean i i cause i went in the real chatham coast gard office um before we started shooting but and then my first day of shooting was in the set of that
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00012.flac	i mean it was it was set out in the same way it was just kind of itjust had the same the same scale and the same feel and and which kind of really kind of tratotally transports you back to that time
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00013.flac	aand then i so me so different from the rest of the studio which was just like i
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00014.flac	studio set of of such like epic proportions this jis they built an entire
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00015.flac	to to create what you see in the movie out of you know this
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00016.flac	this gourney of a of a ship and a kind of a a a large pool of like three foot deep water
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00017.flac	i think ll i feel like almost the location as well as the weather kind of have their own characters to play in this movie almost um because cape coud is chatham is a beautiful like picture postcard um village but there's something about cape cod because it's so it's so open a lot of it is it's quite flat and quite open that you really feel the elements and so uh you know is
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00018.flac	soon as the sun sets the temperature drops and and the you know on a windy day you can really feel it there's no kind theree is no kind of shelter and i think being there and feeling that kind of just reminds you every minute of of
id10376_OSUGWP3iYns_00019.flac	you know  such a proportion that two tancers broke en half
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00001.flac	i auditioned and i was incredibly excited about going to the audition because it was basically going to be me sat in a room with kenneth branna going through scenes and playing for a few hours um and uh that's why i was incredibly excited cause i already knew that cate blanchet was attached and kenneth brana was directing and it's cinderela and the script was s
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00002.flac	kind of classic and troditional it just seemed like am m um a movie that was gonna be
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00003.flac	an kind of encouraged us to be silly and to be over the top and um
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00004.flac	meanhe initially encourage s to kind of ground the performance in some sort of um reality for
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00005.flac	n sychology of the sisters and create a backstory and then once that was established it was there was a sense of of kind of play of just push it as far as you can go be as silly as you can go and uh it's fine cause i can always rain it in if it's too much cause i never
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00006.flac	epic and grand tthere really was particularly in the ball scenes there really was this kind of sense of of of magic that goes into that process um and i think we we filmed at pinwood studios which i think was perfect for this movie cause the's there's that really kind of sense of old school kind of history and glamor um to pinewood um and
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00007.flac	agreed they're either that they're either sixteen yeare old girls or toddlears that the the ages that they're that they're kind of like so self absorbed that they can't see anything outside of
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00008.flac	needs and desires and wants and they have no uh sympathy or mthey have just they just have no empathy um at all and i and and no consideration for anyone else um
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00009.flac	um but i um i don't think ii don't think i can cast my mind back to a time that when i was a little todler in my own little center of the universe but i do um uh i did kind of i have a few mates that ah
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00010.flac	based the sibling rivalry on that kind of ona experiencing
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00011.flac	that kind of sybling rival gy growing up that kind of love hate relationship
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00012.flac	lily in the the blue bal dress cause i'd seen tha i'd seen the
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00013.flac	um um in the costume i house but and it was a beautiful dress on the manicin but it wasn't until lily was in it and i sophia and i pulled up in a car to see lily stepping out of the makeup trailer and it just it it was the first time that i
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00014.flac	i'm in a disney movie i'm we're making cindarela because there is cinderela and i felt i think i felt more star struck seeing lily in the blue dress than i did me
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00015.flac	an see her work is amazing and ten to be part of that and um she brings such
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00016.flac	and and truth to a scene that whenever yougo in a scene with her you kind of
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00017.flac	you kind of you feed off that there's no there's no ere there's no escape you have to believe believe in it
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00018.flac	he understands the kind of that acting process and so he therefore i feel
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00019.flac	ask quite a lot from you and that uh that makes it feel quite um quite fun and quite fulfilling to work with him because he's not afraid to kind of to push you and push you um uh
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00020.flac	you feel like he knows that he'll get it from you if if if he askes you in the right way and that kind of like
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00021.flac	uh sort of every day everyday on set with ken feels like a bit of an acting workshop actually um yeahof kind of trying new things trying it differently and
id10376_hwtznlwVgkg_00022.flac	now i know more about it it seems like a very hard job i think i'd have to have a story that i wanted to tell to want to direct rather than it being i want to direct and i'm gonna find a story
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00001.flac	she found out somehow that our team listens to it in the lock room to kind of peppus up right and so she was so kind to send us like a
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00002.flac	and she sent this memo to us and she said you guys i have some advice for you just go out there
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00003.flac	the drup brees surgery it was potentially career ending um i had to gamble whether or not i wanted to do surgery prior to the world cup because i knew i may not make it back in time
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00004.flac	priciating just e pain i went through um eleven ankers on the shoulder
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00005.flac	i got through the world cup with many of shots a lot of
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00006.flac	no yeah rumors go so fast but yeah um i'm getten an emor i
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00007.flac	my goal keeper coach pall rodgers he's intense he strikes the ball probably ninety miles per hour and he probably broke my rist off one of
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00008.flac	then the final game against japan so in the quarterfinal game i decided to read their approach and you can read the angle whether they're going to open up their hips or not so it's more of an educated guess i like to think that i'm
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00009.flac	decided to take a different approach in approach that i wanted to do my entire career had it ever gone into a
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00010.flac	and i told myself um you know after many discussions with my
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00011.flac	absolutely and i have to say that the nation really was behind this american team and i think it was just the the fight that we showed as a team the american fighting
id10377_AktZd6FH5Yc_00012.flac	be apposed to it and i think i think i'd be able to hang i don't think i'd be like the best cool keeper by any means i'm not that erragant and that nieve but
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00001.flac	middle finger up to everybody and say think what you want about me i am who i am but at the end of the day i'm an
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00002.flac	for me was without contraversy despighte what anybody else thinks on the
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00003.flac	i gave my opinion was the moment i branded myself as outspoken selfish and
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00004.flac	in that room um i told him right then and there you know i
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00005.flac	coach there's nothing i can do about it but if anybody asks me i'm going to tell them that it
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00006.flac	as soon as i started to get up he made sure to push me back in and told me i could leave when
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00007.flac	every anser respect and there as no reason for me to really make
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00008.flac	er so people who can't look at you can't write up the elevator
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00009.flac	yo're using your father's death as an excuse to to for people to feel sory
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00011.flac	i'm gonna have to ask you a question back and i wanna know why it's important
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00012.flac	it's a new generation of players let's break free let's build a game and
id10377_Kl0odAQseYI_00013.flac	i know that my pla speaks for itself um i'm one of
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00001.flac	away from all the hype away from all the media because we did have a task at hand to focus on coming back to the states we really feel so much american spirit behind us and so much attention and so much just an amazing welcoming coming back to the states and we're just proud to be a part of it because we really feel like we are part of a historical moment and not just
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00003.flac	playing defense and relying on our athleticisathleticism to put the bal on abie's head to score and win games but we weren't posessing the ball we weren't creative on the attack but we did have the american fighting spirit so loand
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00004.flac	here comes the final sixty plus thousand people the pressure can amount the media coverage yet we played our best game we were attacking we had opportunities on the gol we played beautiful soccker like the game is meant to be played in the final so did we choke we played a beautiful game we played our best game but we didn't come out on top i don't think
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00005.flac	madic fashion in a magjor turnament over pkas is next too impossible and i think any soccer player would
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00006.flac	this experience that i had um four years ago i wasn't able to enjoy the experience i was grieving i
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00007.flac	i was going through my own situation fast forward four years later and truely i took a moment and i
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00008.flac	getting as far as we did i appreciated the fan support i appreciated the crowd i i appreciated that the turnament was held
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00009.flac	in a soccer environment in germany so i i really can take so much fom this tournament this team was a fighting team we are a winning team i don't think we failed personally i'm gonna celebrate winning the silver you had two of the best teams everybody thought germany was gonnawin the tournament they were out in the quarters so you have two two of the best teams germany and brazila out of the tournament and we won silver thereis
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00010.flac	want to turn the heads of the middle aged man you know if we want
id10377_owg96_aXQcw_00011.flac	for the game you know but i think if we wanna continue to grow our sport you can't just direct it at the young girls of course we want to build the game so that they can live up to their dreams but also i like to turn the heads of all of america that the sports fans a like the minute

id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00001.flac	was head of the lympic uh deliverance commission and since
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00002.flac	the the triomph of which he was apart he became very much the go to man for any corparat
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00003.flac	bret his relationship with sivon sharp for instance uh from perfect curve who has been brought in
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00004.flac	characters in in this new post uh particularly uh there are some significant characters like uh anna who is head of a output at the bbc who's really defult seting
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00005.flac	efficient um tracy prichard um who is uh first and foremost uh a very skilled communications officer and second but equally
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00006.flac	literally on its tos um and in is very keen to get across the
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00007.flac	twenty twelve which uh was obviously set against the backdrop of the e lympics it wasn't really about satirizing the lympics it was really saterizing
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00008.flac	structure and management speak and all the pitfalls of a
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00009.flac	and perhaps promoted to positions that they aren't really fully qualified to inhabit and i think the same flavor is there in due one a we're not uh deriding the bbc but we are u having an uh an interesting look at the
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00010.flac	which ranges i say from sort of hot desking to uh you know the way programs are put together but i think those i think the characters resonate through other
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00011.flac	structure and management speak and all the pitfalls of ah a team trying to
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00012.flac	uh something or mass when actually everyone's sort of passing the buck and perhaps promoted to positions that they aren't really
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00013.flac	the ns or or even elements of white hall that would imagine um you know the risks thatr
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00014.flac	pat of thet it looks um john morton's style is very very specific so every um an uh and and od word that you hear is not a mystake it's it's all there intentionally because john has a fantastic ear for the absurdities of the way that we speak or try to communicate and usually fail to so
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00015.flac	in the dialoge talking what appears to be nonsense but with great conviction and uh only on reflection do you realize that it was completely nonsense but everyone's left the room thinking they've achieved something most of the time they haven't um and trying to get that right is actually a lot
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00016.flac	harder than it looks so we spend a lot of time pretty much holding hands in a circle of goodwill trying to get the uh the rhithem of the scenes right because it is rather orcestral i've said this before about twenty twelve john writes in a certain way that is very uh rithmic and um
id10379_PZPSE6f1m4A_00017.flac	if you lose the rithem of the scene the whole thing sort of falls apart and you get sort of a tonal cords in in your orchestra um so we're we're always trying to to get that better so you youe basically spend your entire day running
id10379_S6yJVWJxNhs_00001.flac	ags en it's uh it's in south east london ne near grennage or greenwitch as you
id10379_S6yJVWJxNhs_00002.flac	and uh you know the the engin's slowing down a bit but they're still motoring and um uh i think the worst argument they ever had we were at a u a a junction a te junction you know and uh dad said i think we turnd right here pat an she said no it's left no pat it's right no it's left i

id10387_NxlCULRD1bk_00008.flac	totally humiliating if you forget the words and he was like don't worry an leand over ecause i'll help you
id10387_NxlCULRD1bk_00009.flac	called defying gravity to that big song when i go up and i'm like you know flying up in the air and it's really hhhigh and i need a lot of breath and
id10387_NxlCULRD1bk_00010.flac	girls are there and um the president and the first lady and i was just singing and i i was spitting like i was spitting
id10387_NxlCULRD1bk_00011.flac	yeah but it's like every older ga man in the world thinks it's
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00001.flac	uh it's a search for what true love really is
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00002.flac	my characters alsn she's uh from a young age she has these powers when she gets emotional she can turn things into ice and snow and um by
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00003.flac	circumstances arise she um finally is forced to flee the cassel and um end uh
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00004.flac	uh allowing this power to to come out and
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00005.flac	finds a way to sort of love who she is and
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00006.flac	and then her sister ona finds uh sort of fer pa to forgivenessand
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00007.flac	in the legacy of disney women i think sheis she's different she's more complicated than a lot of
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00008.flac	steria tipical villans um she's not a villin she's very conflicted and um
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00009.flac	you know unfortunately or fortunately find a lot of similarities in my on
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00010.flac	life to elsa and um i sort of look at is a gift that i could be inside of this
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00011.flac	now even if you get more successful or things seem like things are really great on the outside
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00012.flac	let the nerve set in and not be my total true self my best my
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00013.flac	talented songwriters and musicians and they know how to write a great song and a memorable
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00014.flac	um for me i can speak from ujust from my experience u
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00015.flac	you know it goes has this range and this place that it hits in all f  in  in my voice and different textures and so that i can eyou uh
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00016.flac	girls but it's for everybody i mean we all have to we all have all have to remind ourselves not to compromise who we are for other
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00017.flac	and um life's too short you know and uh for the younger people you know i spent a lot of time um trying to hide the fact that i had this big voice cause i didn't want people not to like me or to think i was showing off and it wasn't till later in my life that i finally realized oh when you really allow yourself to be seen in this way
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00018.flac	the more we love the i mean i think they're just intertwined one hundred
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00019.flac	i mean hes he's actually very sad though if you think about it this poor little guy
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00020.flac	we don't know what his well he yeah then ogu can't give away the endo
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00021.flac	i think so yeah she he represents her childhood he represents that part of her thtat that moment in time when she and her sister were pure
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00022.flac	aand he's an nstalega for her and and he also the fact that she created something good and funny and silly and uh sweet i think is such
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00023.flac	a a pertionent moment in the film when she she's reminded that she's capable of
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00024.flac	was save to help her sister and the land that she's from and in it's like action
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00025.flac	i have many favorite moments yeah i mean i've i love singing let it go i i i think it's such a trasf ransformative moment
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00026.flac	character and i enjoyed the process of learning it and recording it and what it represents to the film and um i also love the song about summer that ola sings um i love
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00027.flac	the're a great team you know chris has been around in this industry for a long time
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00028.flac	has the is the constant and understands how all the technicalities work and and then jennifor comes in with habing written the
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00029.flac	um really speaking to the soul of these characters and um they bounce off each other really well and um john laster would come in every once in a while he was there for the recording of let it go and that was a lot of fun it's it's one of the most collaborative processes i've ever been a part of and i love it so much
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00030.flac	a go and put your voice to couple of drawings and then a couple months later it's more animated and you see that they were inspired by something that
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00031.flac	her hands are her she wears gloves all the time to hold in her powers okay so that affects the way i physically stand and move and that then that informs my performance and then the songs come in the music
id10387_m5-lh8k3Y4M_00032.flac	sweetness uanyway it's just a i love it and i'm fascinated with the whole animation process so i beged them to let me come back behind
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00001.flac	um before directy gets there it actually starts
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00002.flac	amazing beautiful sets and costumes and all the the you know the bels and whisels that a lot of people come to see
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00003.flac	than jo mantelo and and the rests of the creative staff really found a great way of of of taking this huge theater
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00004.flac	sort of opens it up and embraces the audience and and tand they just they the show starts on such a high point and the they're they're so warm already and so loving of us because of her that we just we we have we  uh it just it her it makes our jobs
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00005.flac	wel not to down play me i mean i' i would love that's a complement to me but i also think um
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00006.flac	that that what they grew up seeing in the movie and and thinking of this horrible woman that they're gonna
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00007.flac	um you it could be about a racial thing it could be about a handycap it could be it's just um it's the way people treat people that they'are nota
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00008.flac	to that feel threatening to them in some way and i think that it it makes everyone think about
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00009.flac	norbert our first love who's um originated the roll an ho's just
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00010.flac	insinuate he insinuates that um fer was a man of it was
id10387_oer2VAs7d9k_00011.flac	m more trival and and stuff like that yeah so itit was interesting cause it makes them it makes really brings out that that racs um that racism poppi elements
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00001.flac	she just wants to escape or wants something new and wants something fresh and actually this family move  next or to her and uh she starts
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00002.flac	sort of me ryine and re had worked very closely an working on her and um you know it just became
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00003.flac	you know it wasn't a easy process but it certainly when we got there and wstarted shooting it it was just so exciting and
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00004.flac	for me it's a sort of film i wanted to watch when i was a kid so it's a real wanner to be involved in some
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00005.flac	you know you've just got you w a william paine he's gonna be huge i think he's just amazing he looks amazing he sounds amazing he is amazing um
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00006.flac	you know and and my dad which is great you know for him to kind of step on it's a real honor sill a semed with my dad on my own project it was really flattering and just felt quite
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00007.flac	yes of course i was kind of blown away at first i was a bit like well thisis gonna be great and
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00008.flac	you know i couldn't think for of anybody else to play butcher brinnas as better than him and and as i more character it was just
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00009.flac	much into my exfils and i always love paro since i was a kid so to do someone
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00010.flac	she's constantly making things up cause she's kinda bored and she's kind of stone so for me it's all
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00011.flac	um it's very exciting when actually she meets the gammons and finds like her real detective instincts kick in and you know she becomes a very good at what she's
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00012.flac	um well i have i've just done the third series of mad dogs hene the shave head i'm not having a melt down
id10411_1hEvqYi9kkk_00013.flac	i mean who knows i'm reading someing at the moent that i'm i'm very fond of but you never knowha our gona be
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00001.flac	and i kind of heard about the strike but um i didn't know the extent of what these women went to and they actually went on to change the equal pay act for me that was
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00002.flac	i don't know it was just um really inspirational and ampowerful so when i read the script i was pretty blown away and pretty
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00003.flac	you can't quite believe it to be honest and you know to see what they'e actually doing in them conditions and then they're labeled as unskilled workers
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00004.flac	it worked for a makeup company that wasn't that bad um i don't know i've been pretty lucky with my jobs to be honest
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00005.flac	you know i haven't been a worked in conditions like that that's for shure like these women did um you know we got a kind of feel of what they went through
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00006.flac	when it came to kind of squashed conditions filming conditions and three hundred supportan actores
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00007.flac	you know being squashed into a room and it being quite hectic guot a little bit of a taste but um you know the ththey were doing some pretty hard course
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00008.flac	yeah i mean i i can imagine that he was you know ith people like nicola duffe and uh lerane stanle and and me in the in the same room
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00009.flac	she's such an amazing actress and so it's such a yio know i just find her so beautiful to watch and she
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00010.flac	um i' i'm guessing she was you know when you look at the old vitage um there was a lot of younger kind of younger girls in in the pack but um
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00011.flac	it was a girl that actually did a pota shoot i think and did write equal pay on her stommic
id10411_EL5y78n01Ng_00012.flac	um so i think it was loosely based on her but um you know i don't know if there was a model in the group i think there was she was just a nice character and you know sandra was someone you read and you kinda go oh
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00001.flac	bunch of women in the uh in the sixties  worke fora four danamo
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00002.flac	that alabeled ot unskilled workers and decided to go and strike and
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00003.flac	into what they've got themselves into into the  political debate basically about women on
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00004.flac	i don't know uh dark waters should it be said and they end up going to the house of parlement protesting and uh end up talking to barbra cassel
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00005.flac	quite an emotional journey you watch them ll go through um sandra i play a young factory girl who um is you know ispiresd to be a model
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00006.flac	no it wasn't really um i know about dagnamotas and
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00007.flac	the whole factory um i didn't know that these women went on strike and it i didn't realize that it was the first
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00008.flac	i didn't realize that they changed the equal pay acteva so i was prtty blown away when i first read the script and discovered
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00009.flac	to following the bright lights of london and becoming a model and uh you know doing what her heart believes is you know sticking with her friend and um you know you know protesting in something that she
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00010.flac	no it wasn't really um i know about dagnamotas and
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00011.flac	um yeah i did you know you cause you kind af wanna know ifyou know did this really happen are these women for real
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00012.flac	these women although they did something pretty amazing and pretty important they were kind of blisfully unaware of what they
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00013.flac	you know although this is you know an important part of our history and and quite educational in that sense um i is still a movie and it is still a
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00014.flac	um yeah cause of the relevance i guess it will impower people um i don't know
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00015.flac	uh you know i've my best friends and activists and works for a charity and um you know  i really
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00016.flac	you know it's a it's quite an important cause you know the quality of pay
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00017.flac	an in that sense um so yeah hopefully it would inspire people
id10411_K0rFDvlgDt0_00018.flac	i think that's my version of ferminess i think my mum and dad brought me up to be like kind of a a strong minded woman
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00001.flac	stuff that i've been happy with and then there's been stuff that i had had better
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00002.flac	that are just not my taste and one in particular that was merceifully canceled after after one season
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00003.flac	wrk and and i thought it was gonna be better than it was but it was um
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00004.flac	on the person i mean you do wanna work um especially there's if if i had children i'd be even more desirous of working in uh i don't have any kids that i am aware of i may find out twenty years from now that i
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00005.flac	um but you know drinking does take the edge off if you do have kids i i can understand whe
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00006.flac	shooting they look at what you look like they do make up they do your hair a certain way
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00007.flac	this is not as bad anymore but these issues with authority perseved or
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00008.flac	i'm not that immature anymore although i do ave u uh issues with a authority figures still but
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00009.flac	wanted since i was uh in high school to be a stand up comic i am a standup
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00010.flac	of it is not up to me and u that i need others to say i'm okay to do stuff no i don't
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00011.flac	and i have been fired uh from pilots that have been reshot without me uh it's quite it's not unusual i'm not saying
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00012.flac	myself unfortunately um about it and try and talk myself through it and a lot of times when i'm walking the dogs and i'll wind up speaking out loud on the street and then i have to start singing to
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00013.flac	it hurts my feelings terribly cause i i want to be accepted i i want to be uh thought of for roles
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00014.flac	well i don't know what that means on my terms i want to be accepted in that cause when i  audition for things i'm not ii'm not gonna be me now granted li
id10434_FuxWg54wRjU_00015.flac	i it wasn't me um not i'm not that i'm ashamed of it it's just that poor woman who was daria
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00001.flac	and it's just lovely and and then i'm sure they'll be on broadway with sobasubo
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00002.flac	ninety one through ninety four proximately mtv kind of had a wider wider swath if you will of the music they they uh put in wrotation it was more like m two although m two is the old bate and switch they
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00003.flac	just that i would never you know had i known em to was gonna do that to me uh i felt i was tricked by hem to
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00004.flac	and narrow the base again and and ushur in this er of quent o calle pop music backstreet boys insing all
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00005.flac	perpetuated by the the the wisdom of viacomer whoever the corporation that ons mtv that
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00006.flac	kids don't wanna hear other kinds of music they're pretending that there's not a market out there if you if
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00007.flac	that there's lower reaitings they'll say uh people the people buying backstreet albums we're tired of of listening to nervana now first of all the average backst street
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00008.flac	i think that people should be upset about it it offects and like the the gramis and the mtv wards and the bilbardo wards
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00009.flac	but you should also be ubset if you are a listener who's not being treated with respect it is disrespectful to
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00010.flac	great if people had that kind of like intellectual curiosity to go you know i feel there's ylitango is out there i mean i'm listening to agalaa but i have a feeling that that i have a feeling that uh there's uhthe hives and ami man and the strokes and all of these things i just know in my tiny brain that they're out
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00011.flac	and show her the error of her thinking i would try and show her that what she does is also complicit in the dumping down of america i have i have zero respect for what she does she she criticizes the physical appearance of people who are trying to enjoy their oscar cereamony
id10434_SErC0C5Hoew_00012.flac	like people that are there to be awarded for the work that they've done she has the nerve to sit there with her daughter and that other lady
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00001.flac	thing today on the news they keep talking about how  such a groundswell of support and they're saying twenty million viewers have tuned into this but what they don't tell you is like nineteen point five million of those tune into mock it you know mean like you you watch it o mo you don't watch it like oh i really love this kind
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00002.flac	about how you know emam did suly the atmospere i felt at at the vemaes hewas a little bit hostile but then you've got justin from american
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00003.flac	you must and nd they're so they're so award shows are so compellingly awful that you that you must watch them and and like i think like the grammis and the vmas they should just change the title to horey for mediocrity o now ean like a celebration of
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00004.flac	he he has taken the the torch from cory feldman has just started the idolatry of michael jackson and he just scratched the surfice and then justin has picked up
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00005.flac	why break away to do that at least when he was with them they culd all shoulder the blame you know me the could could he could have at least claied well they make me do this i don't have to do this and then of course he breaks away solow and it's even worse actually than it was
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00006.flac	once said in le of creativity there is an undu emphacsis on
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00007.flac	and in fact i think emty it's it's so ridiculous the way they do that now that i think for all the
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00008.flac	this that whatever that was going on in that suto hip hop world and like guys with their shirts open and the wind
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00009.flac	ntv wards also so that you after you watch the show you just go wow i almost saw everyone's vagina
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00010.flac	so low it that if they were any lower they'd be foulded up in the drawer
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00011.flac	timberlake and agalara both do it like um christ i'm hear to anounce the
id10434_wpYFF_dHMTI_00012.flac	t o breth um oh you know and i like what did you guys come up the hardway through the new
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00001.flac	ould have done that but she wouldn't have been anywhere near as good a politician i mean elizabeth was without a shadow of a dout one of the great
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00002.flac	our country has ever had she was extraordinary and how she managed to as a
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00003.flac	you know her rain without ever getting married and having an air was in the this you know extraordinary patriarcal society it was extraordinary and
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00004.flac	band in scotland who were incredibly clever incredibly carismatic and she took them on and she was
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00005.flac	intellectually she fought them and she was really really good and for six years and by the time it all went horribly wrong when her husband was assassinated up until that moment the it was really touch and go between her and elizabeth but you know and
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00006.flac	i think well when danly was assassinated a um which in
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00007.flac	put all of those men on trial every single one of them you must stand up and be
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00008.flac	she was she was more impulsive and more impetuous in certain ways and i think had she sat back and gone okay this could completely ruin me i have to really really manage this really well and she
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00009.flac	in line to the thrown great great match excelent match the fact that he turned
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00010.flac	uh the the the the one mistake that she made was was marrying bothwell who was absolutely implicated in in her after that
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00011.flac	uyou just the the great thing about it is that you get to go and you get to go to all these
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00012.flac	sat around great length because when we first did this play we did it at the domma which is a
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00013.flac	tey're just not iconic enough in modern dres so then withoughtwell ia well we can afford two
id10437_9uQQoaYIGRs_00014.flac	uh that came about because we were sitting uh actually fhilater and i had come here to see um mamamia
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00001.flac	ye wer as good a politician i mean elizabeth was without shadow of a dout one of the greatest
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00002.flac	our country has ever had she was extraordinary and how she managed to as a
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00003.flac	you know her rain without ever getting married and having an air was in the this you know extraordinary patriarcal society was extraordinary and she managed
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00004.flac	sowhen she first came to scotland at the age of nineteen she was already widowed um
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00005.flac	the severe uh extreme protestants john knox an his band in scotland who were incredibly clever incredibly
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00006.flac	intellectually she fought them and she was really really good and for six years and by the time it all went horribly wrong when her husband was assassinated up until that moment the it was really touch and go between her and
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00007.flac	i think well hwhen dany was assassinated a um which in
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00008.flac	elizabeth wrote mary letter saying you must put all of those men on trial every single one of them you must stand up and be innocent and shoot them down in flames she didn't take her advice she
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00009.flac	ruthles but i think she she wasn't she was she was more impulsive and more impetuous in certain ways and i think had she sat back and gone ookay this could completely ruin me i have to really really manage this really well and she
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00010.flac	uh the the the the one mistake that she made was was marrying bothwell who was absolutely implicated in in her after that you know everyone goes on about mary but you know she was in prison for nine
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00011.flac	don't take this in the rong way one has to care very little about it about any outcome you just have to go
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00012.flac	we sat around atgreat length because when we first did this play we did it at the donma which is e studio about the size of this table and uh we had about seventy five pense
id10437_BOwXDI_yq9U_00013.flac	good idea um and we thought about doing it um in you know all of us in modern dress that just didn't work cause these women just they're just not iconic enough in modern dress so then w though well okay well we can afford two
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00001.flac	allows albert to be um to be more himself he allows the person to allow
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00002.flac	as a wife she's incredibly happy um she is herself she's more happy as hubert than she ever would be as her
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00003.flac	other female self i don't know what that name ever was we never find out
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00004.flac	avoiding any kind of uh relationship what soever and feels his life
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00005.flac	is more um less damaged i think or more resilient perhaps who has suffered from you know in her past and who then lives her life as a
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00006.flac	and then finds that she's happiest as a man and then meets her wife his his wife her wife and um they fall madly in love and they're very happy together so that's fine she's just who she is and she accepts that and that's what's and that's the big thing she's the one character for albert who just says well i am what i am and that's just
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00007.flac	in this in this room hubert accidentlly realizes that albart is a woman
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00008.flac	you know i don't believe that in all the bars in all the world i end up in this one in another room with a a guy dressed as a a woman dressd as a man that's just very funny i think she thinks it's incredibly ironic and rather funny and you know she has her own
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00009.flac	just she's phenomenal she's absolutely fantastic she's she's one of those people who um because she
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00010.flac	patty hees and because she's been in several films where she's been o i don't know the president or whatever but i think people are often quite frightened of her cause they think she's quite tough and all of that and she's uha huge perfection its don't get me wrong but she is such fun and she's so warm
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00011.flac	and and she's incredibly professional which i really admire as well as all of her other artistic qualities she's great we we've become really good mates i think she's fantastic
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00012.flac	big hearted very clever sexy lovely
id10437_yvFQpExofZo_00013.flac	the twist on a take or you know and when i was in new york before i shot this i would
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00001.flac	doing everything for her son and her love for her son and for the opportunity to live in a world with him
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00002.flac	iand she'll have a voice and be able to protect him and that is only possible if she continues with her path of being
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00003.flac	but she's definitely gone out on her own i she doesn't trust the essics whitch is anymore and
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00004.flac	sirive as the countess someone who is a much older wiser witch who could kill mary in a heartbe
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00005.flac	like like any mother if you think that something is wrong with your child you probably go through a state of denial with
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00006.flac	othe stuff going on but she wants to protect him she can't fully understand his
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00007.flac	an goes on and the relationship develops it becomes more and more difficult to egnore the facts that he is not
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00008.flac	is is evil just evil cause otherwize how can you how can you sympathize with your character no one believes that they are evil thut they're actually
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00009.flac	f people much like a politician concnt people to war and be like you know we lost a hundred people or whatever but
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00010.flac	not like to see people suffer and she's always she's sort of a robin hood like fighting for the the downtrodan like isa cause that's where she came from so i think
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00011.flac	she's definitely not like all good let's be honest but what's so great about the character and the way she's written is
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00012.flac	try and get equal pay for women uh she would definitely you know because i feel like that's a lot of what mary is fighting for is for a voice in society to be treated equally um so in modern day society i think it would be very much like she'd be
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00013.flac	five ercaus os of the show tbhut i just loved him so much and he really challenged me as an actor and
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00014.flac	so yeah anything with him um what else dild i really love
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00015.flac	i be connected with mary and o a watch  so i guess it's different in that sense and
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00016.flac	no one to turn to it's like it's all bubbling up inside of her like right here and i feelm
id10438_H4pkQL_Md1E_00017.flac	you can't just switch it off otherwise it wouldn't be real for the camera so it does kind of paus you like
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00001.flac	really smart writing um that's what i found in and dinamic characters and you know each with their
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00002.flac	and kind of potential to move forward so i felt like even if there was you know like an hale in the first episode i was intriged what would happen with her what would happen with john and mary and cotton and none of the characters were black and white so i wasn't sure who i was meant to to trust
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00003.flac	uh we're real um it wasn't just hysteria and take that as you will um i just i mean from from the work that i've done and from growing up in england that there wud the history of of
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00004.flac	that whatever you believe a witch to be i mean in puritin society any one that was
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00005.flac	different or or women that spoke up to a man or had a different opinion from a man they were a witch so whether they were casting spells
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00006.flac	taking the metaphore almost of like what a witch is and putting them in control um is
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00007.flac	a little bit of it yea i think what's interesting about the writing is that we we've gone back in certain episodes and given
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00008.flac	of things to the audience but hopefully because it's seven years we can continue to d
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00009.flac	all combined it's just the story uh there's not one you can't take just one element of the story i think you know the the location that we're shooting at a
id10438_lzvhQ6RqrXk_00010.flac	the the performances that people are giving i think m are pretty
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00001.flac	he tiche blerd she is like family to mary you know they're they're witches
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00002.flac	and rightefully so and i also think that ticebar doesn't really trust mary but
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00003.flac	do protect each other and they they have a complicated relationship ant i
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00004.flac	mary in so many ways but mary doesn't treat her particularly well so
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00005.flac	the stuff that we've had this season is it feels like one moment we're sort of having a break through and maybe we're gonna repair our relationship and then like stapping each other again and so
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00006.flac	you find out thats the season goes on she's actually incredibly powerful and if she learns to
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00007.flac	s who is a much a much older wiser witch and could kill marry just like that
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00008.flac	blod with she came into wichcraft much later she doesn't know the history of wichcraft but she obviously has something special because she's managed to
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00009.flac	i obviously can't happen in front of the the puritans but as we know like mary is very good at manipulating
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00010.flac	also she as she has another battle going  there's a new puritan character he's so evil he just talks to women
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00011.flac	and they grin and bar each other but you feel like
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00012.flac	and i think for her it's all about like protecting her son creating a world in which she can have her son without you know being frownd ound by the purit in society
id10438_mpuRYj9AF1o_00013.flac	back up again and so she's gonna bein you know extra naster o ti
id10439_jTFbjNt7qI0_00001.flac	izero because i was valanteenose muse i was versati'se muse as a
id10439_jTFbjNt7qI0_00002.flac	long with that strive and need to be perfect it was also tha to keep it that way and it was a

id10439_jTFbjNt7qI0_00008.flac	tone girl meets the other girl and they make out so you spend an entire hour watching two girls make out it's like where is the modeling

id10439_xOy8cCOLA7w_00013.flac	to me about you know putting me on the cosby show and he also told me you know i you  heard you were singing you want a singing career because he knew prior to that that i had been in rehab in nineteen eighty two you know

id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00001.flac	i have to say about that first of all i thought you know americans have a right to you know freedom of speech and when the presiding officer you know banged his gavel and said we have rules i mean i thought the whole just just thea to watch the house at work
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00002.flac	document the united conconstitution so whether someone said something about a bommarat  today t was inconsequential this is about the united states constitution
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00003.flac	concience and it's time to bring it back and and it was a symbolic sort of representation that the voice of america was heard and you know in twenty ten
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00004.flac	as on the respect that the american people gathered together to say look we're not happy with the direction of this the way the country's going and we want it brought back to the
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00005.flac	and the fact that they read the constitution just shows that they're bringing us back to americas principles and they listened
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00006.flac	well i i think it's it's a pause it's a patriet's pause to really stop to think about alright
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00007.flac	and i'd much rather have that then someone just disregarding the constitution or not acknoleging the constitution and just throwing something in the hopper and and having it voted uppon when its it has no baring andaa
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00008.flac	law that has given the government such a broad scope over the states and the american people all these government you know these
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00009.flac	o them were are out o out of bounds of the constitution most of them and helth cares
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00010.flac	looking at the document and then debating it that's better than having no
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00011.flac	tense find out what's in it imwe swe d't know that was in the healthcare
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00012.flac	and i have all i'm just actually today i feel happy that
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00013.flac	say things or don't say things to me it's just a great day that we have an o that look
id10441_IO8Xc4rVKgk_00014.flac	you know the transition of speaker to speaker from president to president that our document is still at work that it was read today on the house floor i just think

id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00001.flac	characters um and that's that all that it comes down to really i think that the fact that it takess place
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00002.flac	anand things from that time and that makes it that ads another uh layer but i think it comes down to
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00003.flac	he's there on set looking at each little piece of frut i mean he is he is madmen and without him um there would be no madmen so
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00004.flac	just the process of doing a television show where weyou
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00005.flac	to sixty pages ind very short amount of time it's been sort of an acting school and just uh memorization and learning things and going basically on instinct and not having a lot of rehearsal time and um at all so um
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00006.flac	securities that that i mean i've kind of grown into being a woman in the nine years or so that we've been doing this so i mean i've learned a lot about myself
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00007.flac	wel i just think the quality of tv has grown so much and i think mad men was part of that movement in the
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00008.flac	some of the best writing that's happening in general and movies an tv is happening on cable television and uh i think
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00009.flac	they're not many many many episodes i think tha because they're cut down into to ten
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00010.flac	but uh there's just so many wonderful writers and directors and actors that are doing tv because there's so many more chances being taken in
id10442_SV-ihymk7kM_00011.flac	deep and um i have very little time to watch tv so it's usually the half hour programs ore just reality tv that i don't have to pay much
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00001.flac	you know played all o you know all over the world is is really incredible and end surprising to me too cause i wasn't sure
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00002.flac	ad it was heart breaking to read it when we first got the scripts and then to play them out and for john and i
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00003.flac	you know this marriage and this partner ship as as actors and co workers was ending it was very
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00004.flac	i got used to this very disfunctional of don and betty you know even though that they were obviously unhappy with one another that that it would actually end was um
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00005.flac	living in the same house with the children and a new baby just a different
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00006.flac	thing to walk into ihas a very strange feeling and i think it's supposed to it's upposed to be
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00007.flac	there's just this replacement man who's what she wanted don to be all along but she just kind of filled that space for him so
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00008.flac	storyline for my character in season for as her struggling
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00009.flac	tatin thing that she has oh she has kids with this other guy and
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00010.flac	and done and her's relationship is fraid but it's still trying to you know trying to be civil but not really there'
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00011.flac	in the you know hat must happen to a lot of married in devorced couples so um it's just her trying to find
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00012.flac	her um relationship with the kids especially is saliy is very strained and very volit
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00013.flac	of course shejus changed a lot i think that she's um she speaks her mind a lot more she's uh she has an idea of what she wants um she
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00014.flac	you know married to another man she's lost all her parents she's basically been orphaned she's had to you know accept all these different senarios
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00015.flac	we start shooting episode eleven tomorrow and i got the script last night so it's not only just an excitement to see what happens but it's a bit of pan
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00016.flac	of the scripts are so they're so brilliantly written in such a short period of time and the
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00017.flac	um how they put it together it's it's i mean they really really really deserve
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00018.flac	maybe do don't relate to her as a person or don't sometimes understand
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00019.flac	that she does ind the moves that she makes i'm very defensive of her when someone else talks aboutr
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00020.flac	you know been able to continue to grow as a as a person she's trying she might ot be
id10442_fJrO8V2t9oQ_00022.flac	many of so many of us individually in the show and everyone involved in making the show recognize
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00001.flac	a a couple times and then mat wrote a a couple scenes for me to read for betty because she wasn't a character yet or she
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00002.flac	um since the very beginning because after our auditioned for
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00003.flac	i kinda put it out of my mind and um was doing other
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00004.flac	and like a year later we found out it was picked up and we were gonna start shooting so there's just been a lot of
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00005.flac	time in between in between seasons there's a lot of time and um now there's this whole other gap in between the first seven and the last seven of the final
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00006.flac	fels like a very short amount of time but also very drawn out amount of time where i almost can't even remember what my life was like before um but it was
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00007.flac	the sets are amazing i mean u i've spent most of my time either on location
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00008.flac	uh or um on stage inside a draper or francis home um
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00009.flac	the people that are involved in the show are very detailed to the point where they don't even need
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00010.flac	part of the pass back that people like to rerevisit um and then in visually it's exciting and
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00011.flac	staljic for certain people and the fashion is fun and the way people behaves seems sort of fun but the reason why it's such a hit with fan's
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00012.flac	the writing and how these characters are written and how they're flushed out and how they're very real people they're not just
id10442_zOyfCDSHvPc_00013.flac	they might not like it they might see something of themselves in these characters and then have a negative response to it but i think that's because
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00001.flac	is he fact that it is a scify show that's not really a sify show um i think that that's the world that it's
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00002.flac	about people who love each other and wanna be happy and sadipnd it's like
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00003.flac	to see how well we've been able to integrate you know a the
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00004.flac	technology and and um incorperations and and medison and how that's affecting our lives and also how it affects
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00005.flac	hth've been on net wor tv it's like such a perfect set up for for new people who don't really watch s fy shows to be involved
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00006.flac	you get to finish telling your story and nobody has to keep fighting and nobody has to come back to work on monday and wait to find out like what the numbers ware for friday
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00007.flac	thing ever like all we get to do is have fun and we get to tell a really good story because that's the piority you know it's not like i said it's not about numbers it's not about wany
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00008.flac	an i totally forgot what it was that's what i mean i think that she um that's his way of of showing affection for her i don't
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00009.flac	in the middle of the night and like tries to sep cany down your throut like that's the only way that he knows how to show that love and i think with astrad it's with you know
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00010.flac	like a last minute decision so i don't think she said that i don't know
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00011.flac	udy and her family that she cares about and so i think it would be a big oversighte to just leave that blank and i want
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00012.flac	motional discourse about what about my dad you know he's not around anymore and that' so  tiital
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00013.flac	head you know like what happens to your family a what happens to you wend they're not around  anymore so i hope for asrads story that that is
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00014.flac	stuff um but was wats the singing i had i had no
id10445_9ldBLVvtnWU_00015.flac	especially in this in this world and i think that it worked out surprisingly well like it made it made sense that you know it wasn't
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00001.flac	wasn't here last year and and we were talking about how when uh the three main actors josiand john and anna came and
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00002.flac	it was it was a different kind of ibe cause everybody knew it was tugi abrms but they didn't really know what it was about and now
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00003.flac	yeh you know it's funny it's it's harder in different ways because we had to tranition from new york to vancouver so in some ways it was like starting over again
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00004.flac	was like you know a cow on the high fashion diet or something and her moo is so weird that they're probably gonna have to dub in mose
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00005.flac	have the stage presidence that our new york cowhad but i have high
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00006.flac	that she will be able to to fit into her role a little bit more ut
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00007.flac	writers and of course they were extremely veg about telling me what was going to happen because they don't wanna give up too much information but they said that she w's going to get out of the lab and that they had some exciting things
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00008.flac	that was uh the first scene i think where the audience gets to see
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00009.flac	the crazy guy it's you know a little bit more intimate and a little bit sweeter so
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00010.flac	ntwo is already starting off to be we've shot uh three episodes and i read the fourth
id10445_XLOUc4otqFg_00011.flac	and then just stick with it the same way they they changed it up immediately so i think that that's going to keep the viewers that we already have and probably attract more
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00001.flac	because they love the show that much and talking about how a big part of being on a television show is trying to get
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00002.flac	because they live in a reality that has never been seen in the show before so it's almost like starting from scratch like you're being
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00003.flac	so he's being integrated again so it's almost like uh like this is the perfect
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00004.flac	you would need to probably go back to really get the story of who
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00005.flac	exist does that mean that without memory of them that they
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00006.flac	energy somewhere and people just don't have him in their minds i
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00007.flac	nippit of information that that might intice viewers who
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00008.flac	is to think of the michal jackson song man and the mirror and that's going to that's like a tiny tiny
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00009.flac	to let you know that peter's gone but he's not all the way
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00010.flac	song and it might it might simbelize something important in this first episode for people who are really
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00011.flac	vironment that the audience has never seen before because of course peter peter's not her peter doen't exist we've never
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00012.flac	still two worlds and if you remember the the finaliy of season three uh where the big machine is that's kind of the space
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00013.flac	same space together uh without dirupting anything and so you find out that this world our world is working with
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00014.flac	through that room where the machine is that's bringing them together to try and figure out how they can repair their universe so they're having to like review each other's case
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00015.flac	ach other and we were like it's like it was just yesterday like there was no
id10445_b86awCBDd3w_00016.flac	to slide right back into it it was like butter that part was really cool i wasn't expecting that and i don't think that
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00001.flac	this show is about a comet that is about to hit the earth and end all life as we
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00002.flac	there are a bunch of different characters all dealing with this impending end of the world and we all have a different goal different something that we're trying to accomplish before the world end
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00003.flac	i play a character name ronda she is a librarian she's a mom she's just an ordinary woman
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00004.flac	i'm in prison in new mexico my family is in washington dc and i bust out of prison and i now have to make it across the united states and get home but so that i can see my family before the world
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00005.flac	megan malely in the show is completely unrecognizable in the most delicious way possible megan plays a career criminal a white supremacist who is in jail and takes sort of a liking to my
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00006.flac	i don't know why she does but she does help me out and as i'm busting out of prison she litterally shackles herself to my ankle and forces herself
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00007.flac	i think it's really fun to follow a lot of different people's storylines um everyone's story is quite different um
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00008.flac	i really like the international scope of the show i really like it's really beautiful to look at um it's not the same network but if you love amazing race or house hunters
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00009.flac	love this show just because you get a peek at all these different worlds um we shot the show in south africa in london in malta the locations are so beautiful and um i think it just almost looks like something that you don't normally see on television you sort of see this kinda stuff in the movies but i don't think you see it on
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00010.flac	this show is one hundred percent different from anything you've ever seen before
id10471_GlVET5ja8Fw_00011.flac	ompletely it's i feel like people say that all the time and people even say i feel like you hear that all the time all the time but this
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00001.flac	i hear a lot of feed back from fans who just sort of um maybe fell in love around he
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00002.flac	and now they've gotten married and they're starting families so i think there is like sort of a
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00003.flac	community like a generational thing where people are kinda doing this at the same time
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00004.flac	cause if she checks in after midnight she gets a whole extra day payd
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00005.flac	well in this episode pam is having contractions at work but she doesn't
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00006.flac	but she's refusing and then they get the office to kind of distract her from her
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00007.flac	i think it's kinda cool because jim and pam are usually the two reasonable people in the office but now this baby and the contractions
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00008.flac	my sister just had a baby two days ago and so through my whole fake pregnancy
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00009.flac	experiencing a real pregnancy so i've been calling her and asking her advice on how to act like a real pregnant woman and um she just gave birth so i was even able to call her and say um it was really cute i texted her and i said okay i'm they're saying that my contractions are six minutes apart how much pain am i in and she texted back you're uncomfortable but not
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00010.flac	yeah he sorta treats pam like um he sorta takes on kind of a fatherly role but also sometimes crosses the line into doing things that the husband should be doing so he wrides that
id10471_KAnnsNGPEJs_00011.flac	but um but like i said in this episode pam is all for spending time with michel because she's trying to distract herself from her labor and he is um actually
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00001.flac	fnny because i never set out to be particularly a comedic actress my background i was i studied theater and um when i came out to hollywood and i was making my way i just tend to get cast comedically and i think i have that sensibility but i tend to approach the work from like that theater actress place of making everything really
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00002.flac	like i never took improv classes or sketch comedy classes and i can't do um characters i can't really invent characters so i think that the characters that i do they're always coming
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00003.flac	talked to peter and bobby about it and um it was really important to them that um when this woman gives her husband the hall pass that she doesn't seem crazy that she seems like she's made a really thoughtful
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00004.flac	rational decision she's at the end of her rope and um luckily oan and i really hit it off right away he
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00005.flac	is such a good hearted warm person that we were able to connect quickly and i think that shows in the movie and um
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00006.flac	so it was important it was important that you felt like this was a real woman who was really grasping to save her marriage and um because without it you weren't really rooting for the guys you know you wanted to really you wanted them to have fun on
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00007.flac	was really hard to shoot where they're walking around and they're on the hidden cameras and they don't know it it's um we were laughing it was hard to keep a straight face when you saw everything they were doing and some of it was scripted but sometimes they would ad lib and so we would kinda lose it and we'd have to try to get it back but um so yeah that wasn't that
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00008.flac	think you need to get away from the restauants and get into places like target
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00009.flac	place where there wi'll be way more women than men and women are not expecting a
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00010.flac	id the rapping paper ile or maybe like the scrap hooking ile because those il
id10471_a6b0UyRPP2g_00011.flac	gonna think that you're like you know out working but that's a good thing you're like you're just headding to the garden
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00001.flac	like ilike i had to put the the facebook live down um butyou'reall very important

id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00006.flac	ca i saw somebody's comment that was interesting oh who o i look up to more as an artist literally the guy that i was playing earlier who's name uh is john bellion or i don't know how you say his last name
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00007.flac	tt i love him as an artist and think that he's really hit the nail on the head and he's doing some really
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00008.flac	ye i respect anybody is an artist who's trying to push things forward and  you know or succeeding in pushing things forward
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00009.flac	your point of view up on its head and make you say oh well maybe didn't seewat tha way before and open your mind a little bit i'm super into that
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00010.flac	gongthogh the process for a long time udefinitely drew on my patiente
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00011.flac	oit thik i've i've definitely been made that uncomfortablebefore i hould take that back but it was like a different level of discomfort um they were like rats bigting my toes and the
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00012.flac	near i was taking like the work out class and i ran into him out front of a ritade neare that work out class a couple months afterward and we like took a picture

id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00014.flac	like weird like the monthly kind of checkons with myself to be like oh what have i done this month what have i spent most of my time and last month one of the things ii realized is that i went to the
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00015.flac	so i was like maybe moving forward uh into november i need to cut back on the deltocko
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00016.flac	i know that's probably disgusting to some of you healthnets um and honestly i try to be healthy sometimes but it's just

id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00022.flac	um it is really difficult i actually shot a show in trono though in the deat of winter and that was difficult because it was so
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00023.flac	yourself and knowing the things that you want in your life and the things thatare important to you knowing what you want to gieu
id10472_0IOynLx6Av8_00024.flac	attention to and what you don't and deciding that for yourself and not

id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00005.flac	to bullet points so that i was not memorized so that it could be natural and you would have the
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00006.flac	came up during it and she would also call out to me during the shooting and
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00007.flac	like you know circale back to talking about um derty endoweror what
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00008.flac	and then i would go back and during tha time of kind of walking backwards

id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00010.flac	i don't know i try i try that's all i can say for myself but um forgillin to say
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00011.flac	who is i am like really active and kind of high energy if i was excited and felt like oh
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00012.flac	in the i i felt like i wanted to ad i would only ad if it real
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00013.flac	the the point that we had was that wer thoughtfulness to film about
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00014.flac	id film and the jokes that you know like that you're ina
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00015.flac	since i was yeah you can't remember anything else it is my first end
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00016.flac	desire and she was uh my age and acting when i was growing up and
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00017.flac	ch a huge fan um but you know after getting past that
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00018.flac	just like being totally flored was discovering her personality she's very wise
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00019.flac	and i think she sets the bar really high for performance and i felt that in a good way you know i i wanted to
id10479_Hr9nMngXW80_00020.flac	never seemed right to me but i'm not danna i know my boundaries and i think um although my stand up is about like being horny and having diarea and things like that um i still feel that it
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00001.flac	really you are supposed to adopt dogs and we should um but i um i found regy on what was maybe one of the worst days of my life i was um i really wanted to be an actress i'd just graduated from colledge i did not know any performers or how to become an actress so i thought i should be an assistant to a performer and i went on creg's list and there was an opera singer and i was like wha this is really
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00002.flac	be this man's assistant i met him in a public place he seemed fine
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00003.flac	normal i guess um and he was like well we need help um decorating the apartment would you like to do that and i was like oh i love that i would love to help you you know
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00004.flac	beautiful and he gave me the adress he said come here it was like a fancy appartment in the west village d i was like this as great um and i got
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00005.flac	the lobby was nice the stairs were really pretty i went up the stairs um i walked in the apartment door was like open
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00006.flac	down the beach and it's a beautiful time and then you step on  a dead fish and yo're like o and then you look up and you realize it's like a red
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00007.flac	and like i have tha kind of personality where like my mom would never put my name on my shirts or like no no like jenny shirts or anything because i'm very friendly and she was afraid that like some weirdo in a vand would be like jenny i'm supposed to pick you up from school today andi
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00008.flac	on this barito i look up in the apartment it's filled with garbage it's just a total crack den it was a total crack den and i was like and the dud is in there and he's like
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00009.flac	live a life um and so there were jars of like everything in me was like jenny those are jars of pi
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00010.flac	um so and i was like well he's an opera singer maybe it's like a fancy
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00011.flac	um so i was like me meed to drink and then i looked ind one was just like a smucker's jam jar with jam still in it and i was like okay
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00012.flac	in experience within the apartment uh i eventually got on my celphone and pretended to be on a call um i should ve just left
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00013.flac	s i could leave and then i went to a petstore to cheer myself up and look at the puppies um so i was like wel
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00014.flac	on freeda that's what regy is and he was up in the corner and i was like what'
id10479_YkWjfSi9Jrg_00015.flac	like oh he's just not a puppy and nobody really wants him and we don't know what to do with him and i was like i took it so personally
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00001.flac	like at at sleep away overnight camp and i remember um putting a bunch of socks in one of our counselors sports bras and doing like a stupid um
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00002.flac	lipsink to a version of zippady dudo that they used for the eropics classes at camp and just thinking i was so funny and also we put it in in the but
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00003.flac	i would say i use the words shithead for to you know twenty times a week depending on who i've met chithead
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00004.flac	cel started with the voice um i was at my friend gabe's brother's wedding and we were all like cramed into one hotel room me and my husband my friend mike his husband and my firnd
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00005.flac	gab and i just felt cramed in with all these boys and really small
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00006.flac	just tiny and uh my husband had promised a friend that he would do a video for her like sort of art comedy show thing that she was doing and then he forgot to do it and then like three days before he was like oh shit we need to do this so um we decided to make a little short using that voice and my husband created marcel how he looks
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00007.flac	it's fun it's exactly what you think except more i think because well there are only two marcel videos online we get to do marcel
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00008.flac	and i'm not allowed to use the marcevoice during romantic
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00009.flac	twhich is called the most surprised i've ever been um which is a lovely thing to know what that is i actually don't know what the most surprised i've ever been is um comes out on october twenty first and then i've also
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00010.flac	finished crole show season three and recorded more bobs
id10479_g-qXuV1ICTg_00011.flac	i'm gonna be on brooklan nine nine in the fall just the season premire and go back to parks and reck and house of lies oh and married the tv show that i'm on that's it's on tv right now
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00001.flac	season one that she's been persuing and and wanting more than anything but obviously she made a mistake first episode back she's stollen hovier's music who is no longer with us yes he
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00003.flac	so the next few episodes is definitely chaotic she's going to fall into the whole worlwind of fame and and essentially her career
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00004.flac	a is something that always follows her around she's essentially addected to it and the highs and the lows and the chaos but the next few episodes she's definitely going to be living it up and loving the
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00005.flac	and kind of losing uh who she is essentially and from dates with jo jonats and and red carpets and this whole whole
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00006.flac	focused on music and i've been singing since i was three i've been singing my whole life and and play piano for ten years and i love it and it's something that a lot of peole didn't know they're they i think they just thought oh this actress and ust trying to sing but i've really been singing my whole
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00007.flac	uh the ironic stuff happens very ironically if you will um i was recording in london and happened t be at the same studio as him
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00008.flac	i said sure and didn't really i wasn't really familiar with a lot of his stuff and i obviously went home did my research and was really excited and then when he called and told me it was i single i whas very excited and then
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00009.flac	oh my gosh that's so hard i'm definitely loving the cardigan right now not intoday
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00010.flac	i love the cardegain i'm loving like the high waisted skirts i am loving the
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00011.flac	yeah o i'm i like the socks with the high heels tha like i've ben ding that on the show like the cue little ones like i'm like
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00012.flac	makes me uncomfortable um i'm pretty i'm pretty
id10496_KayD_u3nFEw_00013.flac	cool with taking risks like fashionie like i don't really i kinda like to try everything once so um yeah i guess something not
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00001.flac	um and she's been trying to to have things go smoothly but she's also someone that gets very board
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00002.flac	um and she loves navi she really does but um she's ultimately torn between this new life and this new decision and her old life and the acting which is such a huge part of who she is and teddy montgomery has definitely spice things up
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00003.flac	se represents this childlike happiness and her childhood hessentially and summer camp and all the
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00004.flac	hat are just passionate and fun and nvieds now more reality like schoolwork no acting um home on a
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00005.flac	i have to see but yeah definitely tonight where she or last week where she had to make the decision between going on an audition
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00006.flac	um shns applying to navd goes on the adition books the part
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00007.flac	e a saw all last year of her trying to do and she retay lost it once before because of the cokane
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00008.flac	she kisses him and realizes that it's the wrong thing
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00009.flac	either way i love them but i love working with both actors and both are very true to the story you know cause she had very special relationships with both navid has been there for her bhogh through thick and thin and was gonna marry her when she was pregnant with somebody else's baby i mean that's dedication
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00010.flac	hteddy never really had to go through any of that when she was thirteen and twelve
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00011.flac	her torn between the two guys and between like what she's done and when she's under pressure she's someone that cracks she can't handle it and she turns to other substances to like num the
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00012.flac	she um she does a lot of like crazy things when she's under pressure as you saw i from last
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00013.flac	i i like tried to play her off is like being just so you know like
id10496_PU2Zv6T__mA_00014.flac	abutthe baby is something she'll never forget that's o  life changing thing but as of now you've seen her hold it all together and she's wound up so tight which just makes for a greater
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00001.flac	and other than that i don't really know i uh i got the offer
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00002.flac	initially i thought i was being punked and i was expecting ashan cuocher to jump out of the closet even the first day of filming
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00003.flac	ity todo it to do it with two of my favorite actors of all time was a dream come trough
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00004.flac	but there was a moment where i looked at him and i was like ow i am making out with elfh
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00005.flac	that's not to say there weren't moments in between takes where we weren't laughing
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00006.flac	the hardest thing about this whole process cause secret movies are really hard and my friends would be asking me where i was going and i'm like i'm i'm filming something that
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00007.flac	than i respect them so much and christan's one of my role motdeles and i
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00008.flac	yeah share some screen time with her was amazing and i would love to do some comedies and and yeah
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00009.flac	mas the pyco path that um i'm i'm steeling the women's ment away from
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00010.flac	song when i was nine years old and i love it it's something that i do like wheni'm not filming i am in the studio creating and writing so the last single that came out was called silcon in stero and i wrote it
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00011.flac	ook on instero and i wrote it about some of my experiences in la and it's about staying true to yourself and and not and not getting consumed by this crazy world and um
id10496_UlQorhA7lVA_00012.flac	and yeah and then i've got some new music coming out this summer that i'm really really excited about aso and some films out in the falls
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00001.flac	i um i flew in this morning and my single bang bank came out
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00002.flac	and in  like twelve countries at the moment yeah it's really overwhelming i haven't really d it hasn't kind o sunki
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00003.flac	ths reaction i've had especially in the us um obviously having ariana granda and nicke as super helped me out and i've i'm so thankful i meet them tomorrow for the first time
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00004.flac	basically and macxmartin was like i want it to almost be like a girlband i didn't want it to be a feature i want it to be like us three
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00005.flac	enough anymore and i just felt like since like molonruge like lady marmilard  i used to love that i want ed to be a
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00006.flac	ben taken out and someone else's put in so it's really boing but they have to connect the bones have to
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00007.flac	yes i love like in the uka like bashman um is huge there so like growing up that's all i used to go to is bashment raves like vabs catel op coan like i would just go
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00008.flac	no one would nowtis id is fit there's enoughthere'ld be enough girls in there that would sut that
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00009.flac	like that's what i listend to but obviously singing anny isn't the same you know um so many
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00010.flac	es do stuff so i feel like as times gone on i've learned that and realized that you kind af have to just go this is how i do things it's like if you wanna weare jordans you don't go to a crock
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00011.flac	be i kinda get frustrated at campaines and stuff cause for me it's not
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00012.flac	a moment it's a lifestyle like don't allow bullyin to become moments whereit's okay and then other times it's not like it's point blank it's not cool um and a majority of the time the bully
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00013.flac	ihills like glass on the stage i was like okays you know it's a little get o vibes i
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00014.flac	been in the dark i was weird um and the lights didn't come back on so they started my music so i'm just there singing in pitch
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00015.flac	to get an early night i honestly like i have had so many things in my life that have happened to me that i do not take this for granted like this is my life right here so i ow it to my fans to be amazing at what i do like so i every day i'm trying to teach myself something new and i really do dedicate my life like the way i eat the way i live
id10497_EsHJPBrSHlw_00016.flac	look after myself because i know that one day i could fall ill and so i make sure that i do my best to be able to do this promo skedgal that's ridiculous like it's crazy but everyone else does it so i wanna make
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00001.flac	yeah  now we just arived and there was layes of fans and papparai and i just kind of i think i'm just i don't know
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00002.flac	it's it's kind of in it's in it's growing stages and uh we just saw a picture of me and i was like someone came in here last year
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00003.flac	ways i think it's healthy ifthereo always be a little bit as long as its it comes from a good place you know cause you wanna give your best like i remember just saying to them theyr like you know is there any particular thing you want i was like just be you like i want nicke to be her kind of cool edgy self and i wanted ariana to be sweet and cause i'm not sweet when i
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00004.flac	yes i think it's really important to understand the responsibility as well like you have and how many people especially young young people that are watching you and that your they're like oh they get on and everyone 's like ho did you not get on and this  nd te other 'm like no we got on really well and had fun and enjoyed each other's differences
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00005.flac	live in fear but i don't live in denial that's kind of my thing i don't live for other people but i'm very aware of the responsibility that i have the
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00006.flac	and there are things that you know i'm gonna do and things that people shouldn't see that  certain ages however i think it's important to just know like my neece is seven and you know i just want her to be able to i want her to be able to listen to my album and not have to skip a track or my sister worry about
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00007.flac	it's ti think it's really important just to adapt you know not not change myself but just be respectful you know i' put myself in their shooes and how i would'ave felt seeing something that maybe i wasn't i was like that's
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00008.flac	m i feel like i've really understood what i'm good ot what i'm not good ot what i should
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00009.flac	um the good and the bad and i feel like this new album seet talker is a great
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00010.flac	or i like collarful food people always laugh at me cause i just make everything itdifferent collors and vegetables and
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00011.flac	s on on a daly basis dependng on what mode i'm in one of my personal favorites is sel men with a kis cause it features delo
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00012.flac	it just represents the kind of music that i grew up listening to kind of bought to now you know and i was so privileged that they were on the
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00013.flac	um beyond si's like my dream vocal collaboration kim
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00014.flac	blinds like yesterday and i w i got here last night nd theknow they finished the night before and i was gonna pop in and
id10497_OS6jfTphRl0_00015.flac	to watch the show and i read as the new coach s on this series and i'm really excited to see what she brings you know as a coach and
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00001.flac	not over so much time like still having the album in at the top fifty even now after like three years kinda makes me go
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00002.flac	i don't know um but there' still people thare discovering it obviously that haen't heard it but honestly like you you never know you're in the studio and no one knows you nd you'r unknown and your passion is
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00003.flac	based on everything that you live for every day and and once the people have the power they can run with it you can't control how many people by it or tell their friends or enjoy it or come to show so i feel very very lucky and very
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00004.flac	cause you know when you look at your diary as you probably know you look at our diary you don't go right on tuesday and wenesday i'm gonna have aa frfection i'm gonna get food poisain on friday you know a no one ever imagined right i'm gonna snap my uncle in four

id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00012.flac	no i think you just write yeah i mean i write my own songs so obviously i can only write about the shoes ie walking and the shoes i was walking in was that of a young woman
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00013.flac	clearly i think the core of them are gonna make sure that they kind of relate to young women
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00014.flac	yeah i think the new album definitely relates to more a still i'm
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00015.flac	i feel like i feel free i feel like i'm in moi' i'm more incontrol
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00016.flac	phases they've got lods of friends that they don't really need and you find things and you know i've recently like discovered things about myself that i never thought i would want for the rest of my life you know with regards
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00017.flac	you feel like you foun i found myself and i feel like i lived through a lot of fhazes in the public eye you know
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00018.flac	ll the time and the dice in their hair you know and and wolebies and i've been trough that but it was in the public e and i went through the scarry kind of
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00019.flac	now i'm kind of becoming more of a woman and i feel like i know what my morrels are and
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00020.flac	di tak embr eventar s trying catchu pa she's a lon now and one of the bigest sen
id10497_vdtq3l5f0k0_00021.flac	clas of n  it just os an agree with me and ie usually gott work  ex day so
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00001.flac	so that's a big misconception with um big brothers in school mentring program you can be paired with um a girl or a boy and you can be male or female ages eighteen and up and um you'll get paired with somebody that is a good fit for you um i had two little buddies throughout my time with big brothers and they were both females but i couldhave receved
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00002.flac	pration which is actually really great because i think one of my bigest concerns of signing up for big brothers was you know would i be good enough what do we do for fun what's allowed what's not allowed and they were just really wonderful i mean it didn't take a lot of time to just
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00003.flac	bit nervous going in mostly just because i wanted her to think that i was fun and that i was cool and that that she was so happy that she got a cool
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00004.flac	and my first five minutes i realized that she was a little bit nervous too so i need to sort of step up my game and show her you know how much fun i was and how much fun we could have and within like five minutes her
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00005.flac	but you can pretty much do anything i mean they're very lenient and i'll say there was a lot of times with my little buddy that we just had so much fun i felt bad for the other kids
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00006.flac	outside skateboarding and playing basketball and making snow men
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00007.flac	fist moved to vancouver i felt like i really lacked that sense of community i'm from a small town in northern alberta where there's a lot of kids and a lot of family and i have a
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00008.flac	and i missed being around people who were fun and funny and since my mymy
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00009.flac	with big brothers yeah oh i love it i totally love it and you know um one of the things i love so much about it is people think that it's such a huge time commitment but it's not and you you know you're at work and you'e thinking oh my gosh oh my gosh i have to leave in a half an hour to go and you're sort of in a rush and you're
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00010.flac	to do this the second you walk through the school doors it's like having the best lunch break you could ever have you'r having fun you're baking and you're have you're laughing and
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00011.flac	yare applying the things that that you know are important in your life to your little buddy and
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00012.flac	well um my boss actually told me that the days that i perform best were the days that i um did my mentoring because he said i came to work and had so much energy ad when i
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00013.flac	i had like just a different boost of energy he he i actually was so busy last year with work that he um i talked about maybe
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00014.flac	he said that that know that he would do anything to keep me in the program because it was so important for my success in at work just having
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00015.flac	my little buddy actually taught me a lot actually taught me a lot of things um to do with music she taught me how
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00016.flac	yeah she um taught me a little bit about life just in terms of
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00017.flac	being a girl like i found that ellie was not a tom boy but i'm a litte bt more prissy or was i
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00018.flac	she just reminded me of my roots of what was really important and to love yourself yes but not to worry
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00019.flac	comin to school one day and high heele shos and she kind of made fun of me for it and i'm like you're right let's get these things off and we just had a great time and she
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00020.flac	where you know it's like a friend of a friend and there's an issue and you're able to talk about real life things things like how to deal with somebody not getting along with a friend or how to deal with um you know all
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00021.flac	i just found after having those real life conversations with her you could see such a huge difference in the way that she not only sees
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00022.flac	cwas very involved with my mentorship with elli um and i always went into the office and talke to them a little bit
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00023.flac	mwhere she was falling behind a little bit in like in her school work that i just
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00024.flac	was fun and that was entertaining and that was hanging out in the class and so ellie actually there was a few times where all of her friends were like oh my gosh you know you get to hang we get to hang out with your big buddy and it became a really positive
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00025.flac	clear with ellie when i first started that um i was not a mom and that she you know could she could open up to me and we could have fun and there ware sometimes you know she wanted to do things that i knew you know i one of my favorite memories was um her and i she brought in to i had a skateboard and she had a skateboard ouand we were um wriding um on
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00026.flac	m her and i she brought into i had a skateboard and she had a skateboard and we were um wriding um
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00027.flac	and because i'm so small and it was from the back one of the teachers came up to be like hey kids stop it and then i turned around and i was like and she's like oh okay you're okay cause you're ar big
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00028.flac	and i fellt it was kind of funny because she was with me we could have so much fun and you know the teacher knew that i was looking out for her but that was one of my favorite memories just because she knew that yit wasn't gonna be boring it was gonna be fun and we were gonna have a great time and i sometimes i'd go back to work and i'd have like
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00029.flac	we all know what it's like it's like oh my gosh i don't know if i have time to go to the gym i don't know if ihave time as soon as you go to the gym you're like oh my gosh i love this this i feel so great it's the same thing i think you just have to make that time and it's gonna
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00030.flac	avertizing and i think you just make it happen and because of it i know how much of a positive impact it has had on my life
id10500_V5MSKuwJVso_00031.flac	do it and you'll realize tyou fit it in and every time you're finished voluntering for that day it makes a huge difference on the rest of your day and you're
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00001.flac	town where i was born and raised is i'm a little bit of a gipsys oi've been all over the place but i would say peace river alberta is where i was born and raised um population maybe seven thousand i think there's maybe two sets of street lights now
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00002.flac	eaters couple restaurants but u'm actually drive up there from other vancouver
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00003.flac	o once a year igo an may so i'm going again at the end of this may and honestly i mean i think where i'm from has obpall
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00004.flac	about me you know i just like where i'm from is just like i love sitting around a campfire and smelling like smoke when i go to bed i love four by fouring and going fishing and i love you know now i live in colona um so it's not as small of a town but it's like i travel to new york ale or vancouver or calgry and i'm always like working in so many different cities to be able to
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00005.flac	back home and know that you can walk to your grandmos or your mom pops over for coffe yor my little couson lives with me to me that's what makes me
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00006.flac	tikstor and so she used to inspire me a lot to find things that had a story and that really like you know she loved anteks and so as a kid i hated
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00007.flac	right but then when i think for me when i started traveling um and you kow ive been
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00008.flac	so in austrailia and everywhere you see how much personality and how much of a story in are in all these pieces that you can find around the world so now i think my style is very colectic and i love amtik so i think growing up in
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00009.flac	tat are tied to my roots not everybody has to have a dear hanging on their wall but for me it reminds me of where i'm from so just like thinking about certain
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00010.flac	o nam go as a gramma's basa yeah ore your parents groge cause sometimes i just gon
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00011.flac	and i knew i wanted to be a designer but idn't wan t go to school for it because i'm  incredibly impatient
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00012.flac	met scot morison who is the ownor and founder of catisuber was the owner and founder of catiscu now he um bon's browun's restaurant and he um
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00013.flac	sixty thousand dollars piece of ark from like new york and i just i was doing things that like twenty two year old should not be doing in fact i have a huge gray streek right here probably
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00014.flac	now factors and egnoring the rules and just doing whatever i comes naturally to you so like you know cactus ubam browns they're very like mid century and they're modern but yet they're warm and they've got great art and the art speaks to you and i think he taught me a lot about that and he really pushed me really hard like i him and i fought a lot and there was times that i hated him and i thought he hated me and i cried a lot at work but if i had to like say where it all started it would probably be with him like he really pushed me and he used to
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00015.flac	calle me on weekends or evenings and hou'ld be like no if you wanna get anywhere in life like you have to work more than forty hours a week and i just remember
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00016.flac	like oh my god i'm so tired but he pushed me so hard and he taught me so much about designe that i'd have to like
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00017.flac	th d o with a twenty five beer but i wish it was a real beer but i mean i love to be out and i lo i i hate missing out like i can stay awake till six o'clock in the morning but for
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00018.flac	always be up early enough to go to the jgyim to  volunteer to answer my phon to make it to work to do a great job and i think it's just being an honorable person and doing what you say you're gonna do and if you're tired and you're drog
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00019.flac	fee like you can't do it you you have to change something in your life so whether that means like i often actually think that
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00020.flac	pso but it's just work hard play hard and you mse a hundre percent of the showts you don't take
id10500__AQIIB_ALVI_00021.flac	i think so so having my own fiurniture line is obviously a huge dream of mine and we're talking with a lot of different um companis right now that would help sort of make that dream come true so no
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00001.flac	but it's crazy and and actually i admit there s such a huge team that you're always ike yyou're always at one point you're thinking okay we're gonn
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00002.flac	something i'm not so i really tried so hard to reeducate people like this is who i am i'm jill the designer i'm jill the designer and i was getting all these offers to do hosting gigs and to do all this stuff and i said i will not go on tv again unless it's something to do with the things i'm passionate about which is fashion designe
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00003.flac	thig else on tvbcsaid you know and i was like no no no i i'm done no more i just wanno get married and lived happy
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00004.flac	a batchelor bachelor application video and i said uh no and she goes why i go i just
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00005.flac	now here i am this like twenty seven year old successful designer and you know now i'm goinna go on tv to date somebody i go i just doesn't seem like me and she
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00006.flac	the case i should be doing something like extreemmake over home adition like i used to those are the
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00007.flac	it is and every single time you know i'm i i keep on asking you know miche i'm tie like do youever get num to this do youever get num and you don't because every time it's a new family and every time you
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00008.flac	you know uh tony parker and evea longor andall the tuffean you just think these people are famous and so like they're i'm sure they're fine you know i'm sure they're getting a manny cure right now but that was a really tough period ifn my life this last year or whatever because i really actually did think he was someone calle me stupid but i really
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00009.flac	but i did i did this whole like i'm okay thing i'm okay and then i'm like you know this is what all of us girls do we prtenre okay ad i was like i'm not okay i'm really sad but i'm gonna
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00010.flac	i actually came to vancouver to um renovate my place and i was gonna sell it cause i wasn't sure if i wanted to live here and i was here for may be twenty four hours and i completely
id10500_k_VlNqfZrJA_00011.flac	think i mean for people who are watching this right now if you haven't driven across the granvel bridge or or the lions gate and you haven't done this to your ar
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00001.flac	fully recover especially when the person who perpetrated the murder of our
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00002.flac	has never been brought to justice um it leaves sort of an unresolved
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00004.flac	the family was very crippled by the loss of this child and and so it's
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00005.flac	what happens during the course of the story is there's a special surgery that that takes place that changes john and nick's faces they switch faces basically during the course of the story and so john the good guy becomes nick the bad guy with
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00006.flac	especially when when nick starts to inhabit john's body how how uh he starts to reakhabit on the bga and starts you know killing people off
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00007.flac	quickly um sort of thrown off thrown off gard i mean the first time she sees them she thinks she
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00008.flac	he he has been drinking and so i think she sort of passes it off to oh he's had a little bit too much to drink but he's not really
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00009.flac	an and so we wee tried to drop little things in like that so that hopefully she doesn't seem too you know
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00010.flac	s actually um if i could call it favorite was this was a scene when when nick comes into the bedroom um of our home and i see
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00011.flac	and i'v coming out of the shower and he really is my husband at that point but he's in nick's body and i see him and i see him as the murderer of my son and and it
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00012.flac	cnsort of being terrorized um because he's trying to explain to me that he's really my husband and i'm just in complete terror that he's going to
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00013.flac	it's been such a happy set you know all the people that i've worked with you know ore sa
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00014.flac	the the way he is with people and a lot of it also is the way johncrevil and nickkageare with pe
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00015.flac	um john and nick are such  incredible actors and you know everybody that's been cast in has been very very
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00016.flac	you know has a lot of heart in a way i mean ultimately you know in in in a way the whole
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00017.flac	the whole reason the story takes place is the loss of this child and and so i
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00018.flac	what that kind of loss feels like to a family and how it sort o
id10507_APrARrLD03w_00019.flac	and and so yeah there's a lot of great fun you know
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00001.flac	i love that you know well i grew up in the midwest as i said in a very small town i started doing plays when i was like thirteen years old in my little high school um and i loved it it was i knew that's what i wanted to do and then when i um graduated from college and was fortunate enough to be able to
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00002.flac	a good play and sometimes the next one isn't so good but you learned something from it and you know it afforded that kind of um environment to be
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00003.flac	you don't you really don't you care deeply about the play tht yu're doing but it's over an like six weeks and then you get in
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00004.flac	just you know i think there was some you know for me there was some amazing romanticism about this woman being a more fhen
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00005.flac	i think but i i love that kind of i love that kind of thing because i think i grew up in a place where your you know pleasantness was quite was was highly you know
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00006.flac	on the same you know it didn't matter you know and you could be
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00007.flac	play for a really long time just believing what's written becomes kind of hard because it gets old after a time and you know the vanes
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00008.flac	food but if it's fresh and knew and well written you know just looking at the story and thinking of the
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00009.flac	differentiation you know i know at times when i talked with guarry ross about the character um
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00010.flac	t would be sort of like well and and other other peope would say wel are are we using
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00011.flac	history no f you know they were just kind of
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00012.flac	to old you know fifties television um role modeles of what what families were
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00013.flac	n then yes yeah yeah i well and i grew up in the midwest so you know i had sort of
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00014.flac	i think iii think it was to a degre you know my mom is a homemaker and she
id10507_Mfkx6CIVwf8_00015.flac	spent her whole life doing that working really hard raising four children and working in the home and and
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00002.flac	her life her childhood  kind of childhood she had what was expected
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00003.flac	she would write hand written thank you notes to people i think that was where she was more comfortable she was more private um but um
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00004.flac	her the way she talked cause oliver stone was interested in having me to you know sound a bit like her and and watch her mannerisms and things like that but um
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00006.flac	tvery sympathetic to uh pet nickson's situation
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00007.flac	how cool is that th the king of you know corgraphe action sequenceis
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00008.flac	do you you do your thing it mattered the domestic part of that story mattered tremendously to him he was like this this film will not work
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00009.flac	um and apparently according to nick hightner and other people there w's a stock way to play elizabeth
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00010.flac	and i was kind af like well i have no idea what it is cause i've never seen it and i've never read it so let's just
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00011.flac	cold i think they were worried about her being too cold and too tied down that that they wanted it to be more about
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00012.flac	ding the cros whe they were e people wouldlit say aren't you intimidated you know to you're doing an me you know this classic play and that everybody knows and has read and you're working with dannel da lewis who's like one of the greatest you know you know if not the greatest contemporary actor on the planet right now and i was just like well
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00013.flac	that time that kinda blew my mind it kinda blew my mind um between the godfather films and pocklips now i was
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00014.flac	you know forgehed and he's he's he's a very accessible person he loves to cook he loves to have people in this
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00015.flac	s like i said i'm sorry the music everything so so my point getting back is when everything
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00016.flac	for for for biopics as well cause i love lovio rose you know i just saw that it was stunning performance you know i um and maybe that harkens back to my teenage years of liking tortured women who are going op
id10507_YgrzjvCnGSA_00017.flac	the comedies i like you know cause there are there are comedies i love tot umo
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00001.flac	i was actually when i first saw it i was but i was also so excited for it
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00002.flac	wo this is great this is like what an opportunity to do something like this that so belongs and necessariy
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00003.flac	i of course was familiar with the japanese invasion of china um but the intrigu of the different government
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00004.flac	back then was something that i read up on for this film i mean i didn't you know this is historical material that uhanded handed to me like a whole stack of it but it was very interesting yeah so i did
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00005.flac	dyou know that's what's great about making any films is that somehow unexpectedly you learn something great and and that part of the history i know the japanese invasion it's of course we know it's taught in every school but the intrige of that government was not something we read up
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00006.flac	she understands that her husband needs this that her
id10508_8t97-YsuqpM_00007.flac	s a serial cheater and he's done this many times before but the only

id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00005.flac	it is the longing for mutuality that compells us to create art the exchange of

id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00007.flac	that exchange brought home to me for the first time a prescious idea that all of humanity is somehow

id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00011.flac	the urgency in the longing to share was what compelled me to write direct and produce a film a story that i must tell or i would

id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00013.flac	i had to shoot the film without a government permet because i did not make the changes requested by the
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00014.flac	our production went to the high pltos of tbet which was one of the poorest regens in
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00015.flac	the air was so thin whether so severe and fooed so unpelatable that the crew almost had a mutiny we didn't have any green vegetables or a shower for an entire month and there was also the constant danger of being discovered by the authorities and being arested or
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00016.flac	this was nineteen ninety seven before the era of satelihte telephone or internet we had no communication what soever with the outside
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00017.flac	before imbarking on my unknown journey i made my last call to my husband in san francisco from chunlu the final city where there was international phone
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00018.flac	and he told me that i could stop and turn back that no one would love me any less for
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00019.flac	ove the ship i said if the tytanic must go down then i will go down
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00020.flac	laughable hen i think about it now but the risks were real
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00021.flac	sho sho was by fathe hardest but the most gratifying project i have
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00022.flac	the film receved many awards internationally and i was honored by the national board of review with the international freedom of expression
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00023.flac	but when i set out to do the film all i wanted was to tell the story and winning awards were the farthest thing on my
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00024.flac	the sharing of a story that is deeply personal and important to me was my way of reaching through the fence to give a priceless
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00025.flac	and organization that promotes the mutual understanding of the peoples between united
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00026.flac	we're curently doing a video project called youth voices on china in which young people share their feelings and thoughts on what china means to them it is wonderful to see the young people reaching across naruda's fence their internet with a peace
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00027.flac	one film particularly resonates with me it is from a defmute chinese young man who has been adopted by a
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00028.flac	the urgency in his silent voice is deeply personal and percing there is nothing generic about it no one likes to be given a guift that can be from just anyone
id10508_OZxQo0H6O28_00029.flac	gift giving across the fence is in my mind what international relations is all about like nerudas exchange with the strange nighbor boy once shared the gift enters the relm of the spirit and logets in someone's mind and soul
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00001.flac	thikeverything she does it comes out of that love um the most
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00002.flac	i it doesn't happen but anyway in that world in that um time um that's a way of life that that's how they
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00003.flac	also you know if they get on with age it's like okay let the young girl wants to
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00004.flac	but um the one book that was helpful was called i
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00005.flac	mungl queens um it just talked about
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00006.flac	they are really all strong they actually they were on horsebacks they were in battlefields
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00007.flac	they were holding half of this guy and so that is a good
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00008.flac	um other than that um you know if you googocob um there's probably ten sentences you know you you wouldn't be able to find much um aabout her but what was found that was interesting that she was a
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00009.flac	her compassion was known and so when they concered many parts of the world you
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00010.flac	children that she adopted like one of the uh child uh
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00011.flac	was a character of the finest minister in in the show
id10508_v1aPRoiBZ6E_00012.flac	and and actually people they have concered she actually rased the the offering
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00001.flac	much more organized than i am and she's much she's a lot of her father you know you forget
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00002.flac	um yeah and it makes me terribly sad that i see that because i know after i'm dead
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00003.flac	or je i wonder if i hurt my mother when i said that and she will never think that until her son says something to her and she'll go
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00004.flac	moving to  o los angeles tillit was all done you know i'm saying i never even said what do you think you think i should go i just called up one da and said we're going next
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00005.flac	my mother never said a thing to me but she said to her friend it broke my heart never said  thing
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00006.flac	they think they're all so strong and they can be sixty five when their mother goes they
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00007.flac	jo i'm lucky i they've really known my life i can't explain it uh people know they used to know me when i was single they knew me when i got married they knew when i had malisa then they certainly a lot of them picked up when edga committed suicide my husband when i was fired from fox so it's just an extent
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00008.flac	all such different you know there's so many aspects o all our personalities uh it depends on what the asignement
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00009.flac	uh the my asinement on fashion police is to tell the truth
id10510_1Rna2dYBwlc_00010.flac	my job my allegiance is to my audience and my audience i always think of would be friends if i was sitting in my living room and we were looking at these pictures this is what i would say about so and so this is what i would say about so so that's fashion police uh

id10512_YkaFqsk2yLA_00019.flac	sweet to say the glorio same i kind of like things being slightly different i've had the great good
id10512_YkaFqsk2yLA_00020.flac	and that's what i love doing because i've always believed that gieography and history should be taught together i believe that we are stupid in how little we teach our children i think we patronize our children and we patronize our viewers we don't realize how clever people are and how much they want to know and so i would just like to say here's stuff here's stuff and you youl learn about stuff not but i'll learn with you look at this look at this open up the glories of the
id10512_YkaFqsk2yLA_00021.flac	do you realizewe 're one of the richest countries on the planet  you know even cutting back by fifty percent we're going to be richer than anybody else on the planet so
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00001.flac	everything that's what i said to somebody before i said in a word everything i feel
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00002.flac	to get to do the work that i love to do and then on top of it i get to be honored by my
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00003.flac	to be here in new york and to be on broadway and to get to work with this amazing team that i'm working with a
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00004.flac	this is really extraordinary i think i'm still a little bit in shock about it too i'm trying to come present in my body and and and for me i just wish that my whole team was nominated you know you don't do these things alone you cannot do them alone i mean i couldn't be doing this without thomas kal uh our director and and dan loria and all my guys in the show i mean you know
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00005.flac	cannot do this by yourself and and eric simonson our extraordinary play right and
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00006.flac	thomas kal uh our director and and dan laria and all my guys in the show i mean you know bill das and robrile and cris sullivan and keth nobs i mean and you just cannot do this by yourself and
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00007.flac	um marie lambardy was really an extraordinary person and she had as
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00008.flac	support but whenever the players had a problem with vince they went to mari so to play a woman with that kind of stature and a very dry sense of humor
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00009.flac	i it t that's a complicated question and it's a very good question um there there was process along the way
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00010.flac	um i remember when i first started working on the voice so things were being put into play all the time and i did a lot of work on my own um just the process of thinking about her and reading david's book and i chose not to listen to any
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00011.flac	tapes that they gave me on her or any of the video that they had on her and i asked uh thomus kale and erick simonson and i said can i
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00012.flac	because i don't want no do an impersonation of her and i don't want no do a characature of her and i'm afraid i might so might i just do what comes as we're in rehearsal with the work on my own and see where it goes so then one day in
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00013.flac	i said okay you guys eric simonson said to me you're walking differently and  he said i said i's that okay and he said yes i like it and tommy just kept an eye on me so it was
id10570_FpvbwQUjU3I_00014.flac	when i first rise from that living room set and begin talking to keath nobs and then continue talking to dan loriea that i i experience it afterwards that i
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00001.flac	new also that i had worked with jeffery forty years ago at the mill walke repertory
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00002.flac	that she knew how i felt about him she knew that he and i had done uh other things through the years i played his girlfriend on a series that he did with john lifth gow that was very short lived called
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00003.flac	the thing about jill is that it was important to her to put together a group of people
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00004.flac	and i knew that this would change that and i knew what jeffry would do with this i knew the
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00005.flac	ability level that he would take for creating this character
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00006.flac	and she creates a context for the work where you are physically connecting with people out of like she'll say a line like or jill will say a line like will you still love me if
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00007.flac	and then jon starts talking to you about how to move with somebody
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00008.flac	the cinematographer jimmy prona came and jill was part of the work and the first dad an the
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00009.flac	all the actors and everybody was working off the same
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00010.flac	and so when you first watch transparent you say oh that's a family
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00011.flac	thost people and that was what she wanted to created and that is exactly what she created was this
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00012.flac	drive each other insane but at the same time there was the depth of love that they carried with them
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00013.flac	it's addictive they can't stop watching it no i'm not a bitnh watching person
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00014.flac	aand we really have to be careful that we maintain that level
id10570__6dug2ilQf0_00015.flac	um uh mora is sitting there and she's just had this big fight
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00001.flac	and you love them and so i think that's true about every one of those characters and in particular shelly and of course in the later
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00002.flac	when ed is dying and you find out that she has i don't know ow much of it y
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00003.flac	i remember jill saying things to me about when i was doing it and she said go deeper go go from down
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00004.flac	and i say and he's the one who's been here for me none of you kids and something in he's
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00005.flac	and we did that over and over again untill jill got it exactly the way that she wanted to
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00006.flac	shellie's doing and and and there were times when jill would say to me don't look at them just don't look at them or she would say say that line and just getout of the room  out of the rom so that what she's created what we've created
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00007.flac	is this person that's not necessarily coconnected
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00008.flac	the progression of a character over ten episodes so that you don't get that
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00009.flac	be off you rite shelly off you say o she's this way and then you go no
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00010.flac	the information that's given if you don't block it and make it about yourself or your ego
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00011.flac	jill and everybody else jeffry and amy and gaby and jey douplas so genius and
id10570_dWFvO5ICPi0_00012.flac	and then the work with jone and the cinematographer and the crew and everybody who's involved gives the platform of support and safety
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00001.flac	cort i believed that family court should be all courts should be open to
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00002.flac	because i honestly believe in i believe to this day that the only thing that close
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00003.flac	the public pase for a very expensive judicial system and the public has a right to see that it's
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00004.flac	uh josh was writing a three part series for the los angeles times on people in from different parts of the country that shake the buracratic
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00005.flac	and that piece came out on a valuntines day i don't remember when it was probably nineteen ninety four around
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00006.flac	minutes and they said you know we read this article and we'd really like to come and see how
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00007.flac	well if you'e gonna walk the walk talk the talk you gotta walk the walk so i
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00008.flac	you can't come in with hole bunch of lights and everyting yu can have one camera over in the corner and you can't show the faces of any miners
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00009.flac	and youe always take a chance with sixty minutes because you never know how they're going to partray you
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00010.flac	that was a risk i had to take because i said i'm not changeng the way i do business
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00011.flac	you come in and see it and if you see it and if you agree with it report it fairely that's all you
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00012.flac	and morely safe was the correspondent and he came and he reported what he
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00013.flac	i mean you can't say if you watch me work for a month they were there for a month you can't say i was
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00014.flac	but they first of all they said that morley safer was doing it and i saw maly said e you look like a nice enough fellow
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00015.flac	i mean you can't say if you watch me work for a month they were there for a month ou can't say i was
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00016.flac	can't say that i didn't know my business i knew my business can't say i lacked perspective i had a perspective and there was a rational basis for my
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00017.flac	if you wish to conduct you business in a different way but you can't fault me for being
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00018.flac	because there's really nothing wrong with you and they find your building a deck on your back porch and you're collecting two thousand dollars a month because you heurt your
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00019.flac	and we had cheats like that in the family caurt all the time
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00020.flac	big government and big corparations and they cheate all the time i said but i don't work there this is where i
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00021.flac	you want me to say well they were only cheating a little bit and a lot of people different in different vocations different professions are cheating a lot therefore i will do nothing i mean that's ridiculous is that what youre
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00022.flac	the way i conducted my business and so while i had you of course have reservations and jerry and i instead of having a sixty minutes party where we invited all our family and friends just to watch it together we i remember sitting that night in our bedroo
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00023.flac	door and just the two of us watching it and when it turned out to be a what we considered a favorable piece we went to
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00024.flac	on first avenue in manhattin and met my friends e leane and barry
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00025.flac	who was to become my longtime literary agent jane distal and she said to me judge shinlin i really think that you should write a book i think you have a perspective and i think that your perspective should be told you know there ware lot of academic types that write books on the family court and psychologists and sociologists and theropists and
id10571_BR-KHbOkbsk_00026.flac	group of folks who wrighte and they became they become the text for study i think you have another perspective
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00001.flac	how it sort of would break the spell the show has been such a
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00002.flac	because so many of those shows that did win ar no longer with us so i say to myself you want the my
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00003.flac	because i think if you try as a judge slash television person
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00004.flac	and keep your perspectives your personal perspectives a secret
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00005.flac	viewing audience could tell when somebody's not being honest when somebody is peeking on their leg
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00006.flac	was because i don't filter myself very well but i was never a great filter of myself even when isat on the bench in new york no sometimes that got you into a little bit of ho
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00007.flac	and if you anoy me or if you' ly to me or if i feel as if you're trying to u
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00008.flac	wou judy say um you know the book which comes out which came out yesterday for
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00009.flac	actually my literary agent has been on my back for about three or four years and said judty you know you haven't written a book in a long time people wanno know what you're thinking
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00010.flac	easy way for me to communicate with some of my fans on the webste on a website and exchange ideas with me because i've had lots of experience but i can't compeat with the experience of
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00011.flac	csome and where do you start in the ark you start in the ark of living together because young people now
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00012.flac	who live together before they decide whether they are permanent partners so i threw out a question on my webside i say you must have stories about living together with benefits you know my time
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00013.flac	didn't leave home unless you were married or dead that's the way you left o why do' dressor a pine
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00014.flac	weu're both living in sin checking up there are all kinds of things o everybody does it you know wit started i think with the
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00015.flac	and particularly with regard to any celebrity but i certainly think from the stand point of the
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00016.flac	and that's not a good thing if justice is supposed to be blind it's supposed to be blind for celebrity and
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00017.flac	on retiring i am having a ball i am having such a good time that why would i wanna give that up and do what
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00018.flac	i can't actually think of what i would do if i were not working we
id10571_eHb5mpgcHsE_00019.flac	had a very long week and it's been a long day today and i'm still doing fined and what time is it it's now four o'clock in the afternoon and i mean if i were home and been up since five o'clock in the morning i'd be ready for my
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00001.flac	favorites are but i get a lot of i love when you say omis
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00002.flac	and he was talking to people who barely got out of second
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00003.flac	and i got out of second great but even i couldn't understand
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00004.flac	most of the time that to me was very unfaire i mean if you if you'r putting somebody in jail and
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00005.flac	one woman said to a young girl that she was sending to a reformatory she said the young girl started to cry she said i don't want you to cry i know exactly the way you feel when i was your age my parents sent me to paris for the summer and i didn't wanna
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00006.flac	and we all stood there with this look of incredublity i was a prosecuter
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00007.flac	i would i remember my parent sent me to paris when i
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00008.flac	one judge said to a young man who was fifteen who he was sending away to jaile he said to him i want you to know that this period of incarceration is going to have a very prophelactic
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00009.flac	so the's has to be plain speak so lia lia pants on fire people understand balony people understand um is not an answer beauty fades dumb is forever i want you to think about that
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00010.flac	sai wouldn't i remember my parents sent me to paris when i was sixteen and i didn't wantna go
id10571_hCXLrRyBZk0_00011.flac	in the way she related to these people and one judge said to a young man who was fifteen who he was sending away to jail he said to him i want you to
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00001.flac	i uh we did a long time and we i guess we finished that thing about three years ago three and a half years ago so it's um but it sue was a heck of a lot of
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00002.flac	i'm not sure i i i i i mean i think it was extraordinary that we all were lucky enough to come together but once we came together it was sort of there i mean i don't think there was sort of i don't think there was magic beyond that i mean it was just a a a great
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00003.flac	for a really long time uh and i have two um children
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00004.flac	othat's what i did i didn't have i a a work agenda at all um and and then i would say
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00005.flac	curb your enthusiasm and i don't know that was exciting and
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00007.flac	even if the same thing was good i needed to make a different thing and um so he came up with
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00008.flac	right we have real time and one camera so it's very different then doing the kind of television that i had been used to doing you it's shot like a movie so it's very uhyou know you don't rehearse for three days and then
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00009.flac	we ddthat's how we did signe fel for the most part you shoot every single day and each episode takes about five days to shoot and then of course the real time is this puszle for everybody in terms
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00010.flac	telling the story and of course in terms of kind of kontnuity of coming around a corner and making sure that
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00011.flac	sort of unsomble work and uh improvizational we're a team and stuff like thatit
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00012.flac	well the ui knew larry david larry david was a writer onsnl and that's how come he sent me these signfeeld scripts cause he knew me and uh so that's something that good that came out of
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00013.flac	yeah that was nice it was great and when we were doing sine and when i read those scripts of larys and i thought god are we gonna be able to get away with this because that show was not written like most television
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00014.flac	the conversations were not particularly meaningful they were small conversations that were
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00015.flac	in fact we're doing thirteen this season and then subsequent seasons will be fifteen and uh i'm which i'm you know delighted that we've been able to to
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00016.flac	what's my passion um i would say i'm passionate about the n
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00017.flac	um work uh for the environment um but
id10572_0lQ2j2C05PI_00018.flac	besides that i just really enjoy making people laugh that's my thing that'sh
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00001.flac	o idea it is i have to say i n if you didn't see it
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00002.flac	in the episode i was in the cold open and so which is sort of
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00003.flac	event because lera was there my third year on the show he was there for a year and we were
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00004.flac	and that was in nineteen eighty four eighty five so the fact of us being back there you know i mean how many years ago is that that's like
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00005.flac	that i don't really have any  i recently came to conclusion which is
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00006.flac	but the cooking thing except for baking when i'm and i am in fact a good
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00007.flac	every year for his birthday that's what he asks for instad of a cake i' make him a kelm ppe but you know lemon squars orange cake i've got it i've got it covered but if you want like you know chicken parmag you'll have to go out
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00008.flac	i mean you know it was camping and beside the river and and and but it was unbelievable to be in that environment and to see that natural
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00009.flac	in fact we had this one thing that happened we cause you know we were all actually rappting we had a you know you'd have a guyd
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00010.flac	bin a weird way it does it's um it's a worldon making this show um but it's so much fuyou've no idea what a good
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00011.flac	upcoming season uh in which it that begins uh the first episode of season five begins about seven hours after the last episode of season four so it's fun
id10572_f2sE1065SvQ_00012.flac	that's my advice my other advice would be don't take any advice from selina mir if if selina mir
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00001.flac	for a couple of reasons um first of all it did take a while for the show to become
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00002.flac	i was having my babes during this period of time i have two boys who are not babyes
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00003.flac	you know who was gonna be on the final episode and i was so shocked that
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00004.flac	n occasion and um in fact we got together uh i guess it was last year um and we did
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00005.flac	it's a couple things first fal i think it's a sort of lightning in a bottle a lot of good
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00006.flac	gular vision we were left alone to our own devices people didn't get in our way
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00007.flac	very good time and genunely enjoy what you're doing and and and believe in it truly you know you're not faking it at all um i think that
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00008.flac	ends the teraney of oil man that was great except i just checked and right now big oil is still pretty much running the show but mter president you've got a fabulous chance to turn that around and
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00009.flac	house um did the right thing on the kee stone uh pypeline and and didn't allow it to go forward
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00010.flac	not an expert i'm not a scientist so and i don't pretend to be um but i like i say i sort of use my celebrity to to to to help and also frankly as a citison you know i like to be vocal and i vote
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00011.flac	the way that the politics and white house and capital have been portraied i think in the past very well
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00012.flac	between the two it's uh it's a show about political behavior and
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00013.flac	and um and he's the a genius creator behind this show and the director he has a a
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00014.flac	there for the artist and the and and and what your
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00015.flac	all women in government i think that uh being u a a woman in a position of power um is trick
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00016.flac	it's it's hard to be a political person umale or female by the
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00017.flac	sn because all of these issues are are you know trans vaginal probs and
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00018.flac	oh yeah but i like my my guys i mean it's really funny because i come from
id10572_tb7xTEZrKqI_00019.flac	i it's not an inol battle um the uh but who's funnyer i don't know know how to answer that we have a good time together um and we share the same interests and and um and i he's just a good a good companion i think we're just
