id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00002.flac	tentions and stuff so it's a bit uh i look a bit different but um i get t
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00003.flac	a mystery to me i'm not a big haro fan but only because i haven't seen a lot of them i think as soone as i get into it i love it i mean i love i've i enjoyed nearly all the movies that ire watched inresearching for the for the role and all the books i um all the books i read but
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00004.flac	things that make a vampire what whe are but there's also other things more important
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00005.flac	i may have sugjested that i weared the mare cause i was cold on set it was so cold shooting the show i mean i was freesing all the time so any extra laier we could get ut always take so
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00006.flac	isin cold in bristel as winter um ye'm great surprised i don't know how
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00007.flac	being awarewolf that i just sukreally wouldn't i me that you don't gane you don't benefit at all really from that guss ti be a
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00008.flac	be a vampire o guest then wo a i be a vampire cause i just cause i can't be the other two
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00009.flac	think ang i don't now live forever bt i love to live like five hundred years and then just u i' tough myself
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00010.flac	you know i need to be a more honest person  i didn't i didn't miss u no i did't geta  that um but yeah i as an actor i learned to tones
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00011.flac	when the first jobs i've don o one of the bigest jobs i've don um so to work with the the calaber of actors that ive workd h
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00012.flac	but yeah if as an actor i learned to tones i i mean i learne so much this is one of the when the first jobs i've done he'm one of the bigest jobs i've don' um so to work with the the calaber of actors that ive worked with
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00013.flac	i think i'l be excited by anything i love to make anything work and because now i have such a better sense
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00014.flac	where he's come from and all those kind of things and just a bette sense of him as a character i think i'd love to try anything out
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00001.flac	you know he he's he realizes that this is oh it's all too much thers people getting huart this
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00002.flac	n if he was to do that and completely cut tives in the story that's not that's not a bad resolution from itul i don't think now at least you knows you can't huart anybody else or at least he's not responsible soly responsible for the legacy of these other people that are all lathe inocents you know so it's a hard thing to have so when he shows up at the house after killing hearick
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00003.flac	he he needs to be stoped and killed and and the only way really is to is ti let his best might do i don't think it was ever the writer's intention in thi show to kinda make characters that are likeable as such anyway i think it's hard to to write that down i think it's yhe just kinda have to feel it and play is and i i
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00004.flac	nocking around for centuries so he's not done with living yet un like michele and in a lot of way so
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00005.flac	i can't believe it's all over now i can't believe this is the end after everything t this is the end
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00006.flac	uh so that's what machele does and he makes the bravest decision that he's
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00007.flac	certainly madein the entire series i mean probably in in in all three of them you know it's it's a proper decision of bold decision and
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00008.flac	some of themthey get through and and some of them they don't and i think it's it's a realistic sort of balance on that um and how they deal with
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00009.flac	i think it's manage to do that's something i' quite proud of at the show i think they've managed
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00010.flac	you know he's managed to get several lives just gooder bader in different i don't think it matters i think he's managed to screes a lot of living in
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00011.flac	for other people i think it's the consequence of what he fears he fears runing life for other people but it's that mentality i think a lot of those vampires would have i don't think they fear death that way
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00012.flac	uh it it's a funny thing finishing jobs you know you think the emotion will be in the scene and and hopefully bits ut will be but sometimes that can that can sort of change things not always in a good way you kinda need to
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00013.flac	uh hate saying this ing character um and not to be you cause he can be very he can be very self indulgent you know just to to let your own emotions consume what's going on e i don't think it's a it's not about me it's it's about michel um so i think to serve him right
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00014.flac	uhi kind of you need to kinda know your heads out and stuff i think i think at the party i think when we have a couple of drinks afterwards and stuff that wiuld be um no that tere's a lot of people i wnt
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00001.flac	i'm pretty excited yeah it's like to do presse and to kind o revisite the memories of the show um it's nice to be out here doing it to and the first series went down pretty good
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00002.flac	welli know i know it's yeah clif hanger you know u put intended were we're rightin the side of the clif wan it all happens um that's where we thats where we continue right in real time from that moment um it's pretty rugh for us i mean it's his
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00003.flac	gindiliquidation they broke um the relation with with domazas kind of ad it's worst they lost julia um their their daughter it
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00004.flac	there's the only way it's up and then you know he gets when it's potentially charged with with inciting ariet and and murder which is a death sentance at that time so it's it's pretty grim for for the
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00005.flac	well i think george always wanted to be in the gang you know george is is the son of a of a ilegitimaut um uh black
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00006.flac	you know he he always wanted more um and i gues ross had it you know ros kinda semiously sort of slips between the the aristocracy and and and the working class and that's something that george just can never get you know george wants to be he wants to be ros ou knowhe wats to be the leader  leader of the gang and and thit's not really happening why rosswone let him in i guess he just dusn't have perspect from you know all he wants
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00007.flac	yeah yeah he he relly wats to bring ros down i mean he's he's absolutely committed to doing that um and he's he startsto by doing a a decent job i mean this he sends flyes arounda
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00008.flac	yeah um the les drana isn't it i mean i g i i to suppose i don't know
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00009.flac	it's a lot of fun to play i mean he feels like a a real person to me i mean he's flared that's wat like he's not just this
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00010.flac	just stepping in as this iconic kind of um person legndry figure um on a horse you know riding into town and saving everyone's life and being the robin hood character to everybody and he's not he'
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00011.flac	it's um he's a real guy fror me you know he's he's heavily floered he he makes mistakes
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00012.flac	he's he's very proud um he's not great a deligation ad you know he's he's what we probably called ur control friee you know these days you know he wants to do everything himself he ants the way to the world he doesn't wants to he doen't never want te melte to worry about anything um he's a
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00013.flac	but he is the people's hero too you know i mean by defalt he wants to help people you know that's that's where he lies and think e's got a big heart um and he realizes he needs to stick around to to re establish the mining industry to give people jobs to to help people i mean that's um and he's a good drinker too he anjoyhs is
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00001.flac	in america they're angry uh in general i think they're angry at inflacion and they're angry at
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00002.flac	at an and not being nuhable to influence their own lives
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00003.flac	i i i don't understan why they still call them stu students they've had the hostages for ninety days don't you get don't you get expelled if you'r out of school for ninety
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00004.flac	time and um and people are very angry so they take out their anger and then they they they use um sexual explitives to express their anger ther's that funny thing whe're uh people expres their anger sexually and it makes you wonder if they express their sex angrily and i wouldn't want to actually
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00005.flac	uh one of the strong reasons i wouldnt is that i wouldn't um send people off to war and that kindas a basic requironment of being president that you're willing to do that
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00006.flac	reading a next question in to hit about it because the the the thing that's coming up now is should they draft women
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00007.flac	well if they draft anybody i think they auh to draft everybody i think that el i don't i i don't understand the thinking that feels that women are so inferior that they can't
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00008.flac	in u whatever meaning fol action is taken i i think if uh if something important and vitl
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00009.flac	with me what they would do about it and how they would react to it and for the first time in their live
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00010.flac	they were talking to me about something that concerned them as people the course of history
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00011.flac	uh and it's a horrible way to to go about it it's uh it's it's uh it's an it's an
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00012.flac	did include them as as principles in the action uh i don't think we should uh exclud women as principles
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00001.flac	to get gen to u agree to let me work on to let me do i i i had an ithis idea for thi story about thi aiatris becoming depressed and and writing ah to get out of his depression he writes a secret letter to simanfroyd and
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00002.flac	uh i mean in his imagination porit is of course dead bu this time
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00003.flac	uh gen said  no this is a mistake don't do this because if you if you ask an actor to play depressed it i'll be depressing for the audience
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00004.flac	i took that to heart and i and i went even more for what i
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00005.flac	had a sense i could do but i but id really confermed this forme and a and made me go more in this direction which was that the guy is fighting his depression and on the cirfice seems
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00006.flac	a lid on it and and is kind a hold it trying to hold it down and that uh that helped make that work but it is't it isat dangero if you if you have if you askin an actor to to play somebody depressed ther first tenenc yous to get marose
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00007.flac	i just i just loved his work and i and i wanted to write for him i was so convinsed that he really was a saciatriss i used to sit and talk with him between scenes as if he was a kytrisan after a couple of months of that i noticed he was giving me these strange looks
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00008.flac	to me and i would talk to him as if he i knew he was an actor i knew hiet wasn't this a kiatress but he just seems so so real in the
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00009.flac	you know both of these shows i that you're asknd me about here i i i wrote and directed
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00010.flac	i had a lot of fancy writing in anga i had had it opened with a a
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00011.flac	of of hok guy you know to set him to set him up as this woman ising guy that that anga takes down a notch
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00012.flac	i i loved that writing so it made it made me  made me very
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00013.flac	a handspring on the way to the stage to pick up my emi i because i was so i was so really really happy to
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00014.flac	n you get in the word for acting and you don't really know how much of it is
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00015.flac	cut or or because youre on a popular show but if you get in a word for writing the chances are much
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00016.flac	the interesting i talked about how i thought i did a good job writing especially i that that monalo get the
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00017.flac	thati was able to come up with but the funny thing is about writing is that the stuff that comes out the best i think is stuff that you feel you just happend to be
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00001.flac	i was making a movie in the uta state prison when they sent me the script
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00002.flac	i what i i i i had to wait until i was finished with the prison job uh before i could say yes to it
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00003.flac	that the war wouldn't just be a jovieal background to high jings i i didn't wantna do high gings at the front
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00004.flac	um recent example of a wartime comedy was a mickal's
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00005.flac	the kind of thing we wanted to avoid i mean everybody was amiable on that program wan it was amusing but
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00006.flac	the job they had i mean it might have been the newseroom an the mary tilen were
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00007.flac	and and the people who come back from wars tell you that and the all the research we did certainly conferm that
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00008.flac	painted war is a nutural or even amusing
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00009.flac	and i didn't know how they felt about that n that's not somethng you can talk about on the phone easly so they had to wait untill i
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00010.flac	happened to be the night before they were gonna begin rehearsing at a about ten days rehearsal and then we were gonna shoot the pilot um so we sat up in a coffie shop in a
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00011.flac	the night before we rehearsed and we talked till about two in the morning and they were in complete agreement with me i just but i needed to be reassured
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00012.flac	the way we did the show but the fact that we did the show that
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00013.flac	difference between that show and just about any other comedy that had ever been on up until then because we
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00014.flac	very funny comedy we had all kinds of comedy comedy burles satire
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00015.flac	and we didn't drop either of those and that gave us a combination that was
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00016.flac	it gave them a chance to appreciate the show the way you appreciate
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00017.flac	life is not a series of gigles the way most half hour
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00018.flac	it was by the way in my mind not about the vet no
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00019.flac	refernce well there were  the i understood that there were connections because it was
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00020.flac	i didn't think we were trying to convinse people any of anything about the vt num or i think lary galebart
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00021.flac	but it's really about now it was to say a hundred years ago was irning i think
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00022.flac	except then i thought that that ware applied what we had to say about that were applied to all
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00001.flac	sort of unexpected family and it and it and it goes really weal  we are really a great family tlitle boy b los sime as we are in love and everything is great and then
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00002.flac	absolutely i think in a funny sort of way because it's a perd piece you can tartof stand back from it and and look at it but in so o doing you realized that there's a not much has changed there has been great strides and sam alas
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00003.flac	biggetry and pregidous in homeo fubia i have not ebed i've not disappeared so it's it's it's really i think that was actually one of thenameis why w didt wante to do it because i thought it did have a lot to say about it's good to remember that great things have happened and but we mustn't become place and i mean musten't ike you know be greateful for getting ar right s should we should they are rights not privileges and we should demand
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00004.flac	you know the one of the best things about doing this film is meeting him and haven't spendig that time with him and and you
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00005.flac	nstenly came out in america getting to see in atall tese other events her's been and keeping in touchd wit them we sent a tle

id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00001.flac	tl cming long but the othe thing about being the host of it this weird is that you know when you host the show normally like if you host thome filmar words you don't hae to like make a film ut like when you're te host of the toentes you actualy have to be in these musical
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00002.flac	we're doing this like tribute thing to him and its sort of like being in a weird kind of vertual reality dream for me because we're doaning

id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00004.flac	because i think um especially in  placers late trainer whe're theyare no dealing with s epidemic and it in a uh you know and and i saw not prepared or whereant prepared for it um and i just feel like i've always felt like that uh t i still has such a stigmarf
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00005.flac	sort of idea that gaypeople were in some way you know invented it
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00006.flac	few good things that maggy thatchar did uh was she did this campion uh whil she didn't but she
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00008.flac	find myself really is by sexial but i don't mind i don't care what you call i mean i i think it's really un
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00009.flac	remember just before i got that actual thoght i really  to play more growing up people you know people who just aren't
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00011.flac	i i uhit was i think everyone knew it was kind o going to these last films
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00012.flac	but it just tik so long for it to happen it's shot for a year and a
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00013.flac	tom cruse an stanlicubrk i i'd met tom before he was very nice and i went
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00014.flac	thiss not this is not king leer i'm playing hou i just  was and  i just too arli and i just thought i mean
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00015.flac	i feel i'm nearly fifty and it's kind of when you say that you think craky what
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00016.flac	i i i i like being alld because of the wit and the expeedience and things that you you gain and you have and and yet i love the fact that you know i i still seeme to have the energy
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00001.flac	uh as i have  two shows coming up today which seems at the moment like a kind of impossi
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00002.flac	was a what we calle primary school so n kno what you call that um elemen just seven years o
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00003.flac	well i think i was quite an i 'd already trained as agrapfic designer i'd already
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00004.flac	uh and in and in fact once i' decided that  now i was the time i it was always too earliy for me
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00005.flac	about being an actor al though i probably always knew that's what i
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00006.flac	what do you do you write letters two repatry companies and they all say well we've only got two eequity cards o year to give
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00007.flac	um we've only got two erity cas  year to give and you must
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00008.flac	a lak a lot of things a lot of activities you wrote this piece of your equipment called your
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00009.flac	and that takes forever to so to answer your question it's not
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00010.flac	you know as i was just saying to you what i hear is not what you hear so i don't even knew what you're talking
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00011.flac	a lot of it's just to do with the arcitecture of your mouth the sound
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00012.flac	you know there's a there's a rud definition of acting i forget which of which of the english actors was tha
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00013.flac	and as luck would have it or one of those jorining up the dockmoments was i did a play by dusty hus calld com
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00014.flac	that eventually led me to doing and a for bem play called the lacky chance  the wrl
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00015.flac	n dongers backet strapford but this time back it strafirt i kinda new when i was
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00016.flac	theater and we go over the rad to a baro restaurantnd there's a bunch of actor's rul
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00001.flac	and produces ram your armup behind your back and and say listen if you'd play this part we
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00002.flac	um it's not even as if you have the opportunity to to consider what the challengees are the only thing that made it in any way doable for me was
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00003.flac	and in many ways actually the challenges on film aless because you've got so much more of a support system you're surrounded by people who know what they'r
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00004.flac	that set in sixtyen eighty two in france and you're shooting it in england
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00005.flac	never more than twenty five miles from a motarway or if the wind changes you've got a flat path coming over your head so suddenly the word capt is happening
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00006.flac	if you kind of through a less su around them you'd come out with human and
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00007.flac	period nature of it was it wasn't in a relevance cause of caurse it's a
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00008.flac	when you or members of the audience watch it i kind of hope that you're all
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00009.flac	mearly decorative objects they had no function so kate winslit's character in the film
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00010.flac	you know you still have women as decrative objects all over the
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00011.flac	change and everybody sits at home with their huge screen and thei five seats ind their suround sat and
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00012.flac	sit together with a bun a huge bunch of other people and and and a kind of once uppon a time
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00013.flac	macacrosm of what i've just talked about because because on the filmset you may have a scen between two people but this
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00014.flac	forty people with clip boards all around it everybody kind of knows um
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00015.flac	and in uh iit's what i was saying about ka before anda andmaties two youre you'r your you got two characters who have to learn who they are on screen so therfore all the takes of them
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00016.flac	yeah yeah you thought you knew what this film was about or what im about i the movie uwas about but
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00017.flac	that was very mesurably a time when we knew things were difficult
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00018.flac	the families nit together so u bit like a film crew came into operation ants and
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00019.flac	in you know amazing tbhat it sticks in your m the title role in a play called king gres
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00020.flac	goes back to what i was saying about that silence you're involved in a story and then there's lode people in front of you and theyve gone
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00021.flac	tbut it it was u fantastic school and remains a fantastic school because it doesn't term limit you it's now co educationl in fact when i went there it was all boys uh
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00022.flac	very involved in the art department and so and because it was a very highe atchieving i cademic scrowl the idea of going to drama scrowl
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00023.flac	go to art scrowl and i went to art scrowl but still
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00024.flac	whatever piece of my brain is missing i don't know it's never ever thought that way um about
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00025.flac	od my head you now i i  all i really remember from that time is
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00026.flac	if there's something difficult to butten up or something thit's gonna be falsoned behind in the dressing room
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00027.flac	and then if they got changes down to the wings with the quick change costume and theyr
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00028.flac	when i relased to play it cause you have to remember that ony three books have been written when we started filming
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00029.flac	put through her on the phone she was with her sister at the time and she
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00030.flac	it is it is possible clearly to manippulate people into an emotional
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00031.flac	itsthat ie gonna fail you know that it's possible to try things that aren't going to be necessarily attractive i mean i'm not sure
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00032.flac	and i do believe i as an actor am part of a
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00033.flac	like most actors i don't enjoy watching myself cause of all you see is what you
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00034.flac	and you know one has so many examples of people like
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00035.flac	uh or how much preparation you've done but somehow it all a ribes
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00001.flac	yeah pretty well i mean he ma you mar say he's just a average man
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00002.flac	absolutely liberating yu it's uh well i mean yu  sometimes acting can be a great sort of playground and  uh and this certainly it was that
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00003.flac	it's pretty tough you know first thing in the morning good morning my names alan what's your name o fn well you like to bend over this desk
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00004.flac	nickeralastic slea snapp or anything like that you know we were pretty
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00005.flac	um i think it all becomes part of the job likethis you know
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00006.flac	you know get up a haps five in the morning and curman star at a smiling
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00007.flac	uh about a piece of work you've done is one pout of the jobe and another pourt of the job i think which of course it
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00008.flac	is um a wards um i think but i think uh any sensible actor knows that parts when prisees rather than the
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00009.flac	t again it's port of the industry i believe in the film industry and i believe in telling stories i think it's all incredibly important we have to do it for the human race to survive and and awards our part of promoting that so um it's always interesting to see where tho'se
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00010.flac	well yeah because you can do it in your pajamas rather than a botire and uncomfortable
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00011.flac	i don't know i mean i've got i've gotten some pieces of mettl at home with my name stamp
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00012.flac	um but you know what i when you think about uh movies and jobs you've done really the image you have is of the people you worked with am where you were in the world you know
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00013.flac	well i mean i started doing some work with that with him bertan and i said to him so do you want funny voices and he said no and so uh i'm at the beginning stage of it where because it's a mixture of live action animation stop motion i'm in the animation part of it so we've recorded me and now s i're gonna go away and drowy it and then i'll come back and revoice it many months down
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00014.flac	he's pretty um motionless but you know who knows i'm not quite sure what they've got him
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00001.flac	more eimies than any other qis or game show on television and yet there seems to be more excitement about the
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00002.flac	de tend to do better than others doctors loyer not
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00003.flac	urlists also we discovered that of course in our power players turnament in
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00004.flac	n device and i tell them don't worry as soon as you come up with a corect responce you gane in confidence if you get the next
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00005.flac	went by and unfortunately for me my two children discovered some of my old
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00006.flac	grades kept going down i i was just too tired i was working to
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00007.flac	bn in broadcasting for fifty years hosted jeferedy for twenty eight years a reporter asked me have you ever thought about
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00008.flac	debates that i have seen that are hoasted by people in the news reporters comentaters is that it's all so
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00009.flac	to come in and say het you know what's your vision for america
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00010.flac	we really want in this country is this a capitalist society well i don't think
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00011.flac	and i would hope that somebody they get the man off ths and some of the debates in the republic and
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00012.flac	s jepraty all uh all kinds of people because americans are very
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00013.flac	and they can play in the safety of their homes the there's no danger for you if you
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00014.flac	yeah you'll learn a lot of trivia and that won't do you any good in life but you will i hope be
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00015.flac	uh during the commercial break about the new film about eurnest hemming would i i didn't know that he was involved
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00001.flac	parence on his last appearance uh doing a
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00002.flac	we've never had any contestante who are we're as ornery as men and as troublesome as the shon
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00003.flac	i'vd been asked  whether uh how i would feel if we had uh shon conry as a contestent on celebrity jeprity and uh because i'm such an easy going guy i tell everyone i just walk u
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00004.flac	it's something i can regrow any time i want it's an easy thing to do you don't need a great deal of talent to grow up
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00005.flac	and tha yet people still talk about and it made the news of course when it
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00006.flac	newsday there wasn't any war going on and uh a lot of the tabloids got hold of that bit of information and we're playing it up and so people noticed
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00007.flac	ubut it's a difficult one because keep in mind that our first president served almost two in ha half senturies ago and so the amount of information that george washington had is a lot different than the amount of information that maroco boma has but all other things being equal i would think perhaps woodrole willson might have been a good
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00008.flac	uh jimmy carter was known as one of the smartest presidents when he took
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00009.flac	as well so i would pick those three as uh legitimat
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00010.flac	no i don't want to uh venture a response on that some of them uh were more recent than
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00011.flac	became our champion not too long after we
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00012.flac	got rid of the rul that said you had to leave the show after five wins and he wound up winning seven
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00013.flac	ken jennings was really the perfect storm of contestant game material and savy in terms of
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00014.flac	had a good sense of humor he was bright certainly he knew how to play the game knew how to emphacize certain points at
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00015.flac	on a duble jeprity or a final jeprity clew and uh i think ken was one of a kind and i'm not sure we're gonna see that kind of success ever again on jeperety he was with us for four in ha half months my gosho was spending more time with ken jennings
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00016.flac	for our ultimate turnamat of champions in the final match which was a two game total point
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00017.flac	i i over heard uh our three contestants talking before the show and uh saying you know what we should do to throw alix's off his game we should
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00018.flac	and they didn't do that of course and i thought that was kinda silly because they're behind theyre lectors
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00019.flac	my trousers o and i walked out without pans and that really blew them
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00020.flac	when i come out i'm out in the open somebody wrote in and said you have good legs so that was
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00021.flac	all the time i hav what i calle senor moments uh i have a story that i tell also when i began on jeporety i was much younger of course i was in my fourties and i never made mistakes then after a few years i would catch myself just as i was about to miss speak and
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00022.flac	myself just after i made a mistake now i'm at an age where i don't even know when i make a mistake i have to be toled by
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00023.flac	we have to uhask you to reread that cle why because you said seventeen forty three instead of fourteen seventy three ohi
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00024.flac	sit down as the host and that's something ai have had the opportunity to do only once in my television hosting
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00025.flac	my age it's nice to sit down and the great thing about hosting hollywood squares is you ask a question of a celebrity and the celebrity gives a funny responce
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00026.flac	and i can't think of a much better job than that one unless it's the one i
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00001.flac	suggestion i said you know there ben a lot of different actors who portraded why i
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00002.flac	uhin aditiion to the witer television series and keven costner
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00003.flac	so they wrote a cattagory on wer and it played well and they did cattegores calle you know alix's favorite film
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00004.flac	ui don't have uh such a big e ego that if they don't accept them i'm gonna get my nose out of joint if you except them fine if you don't
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00005.flac	and in the studio when we are talking about a responce and whether we should acxcept it or whether our ruling was correct i expresse my opinion sometimes forcefully but if they don't acxcept my opinion i'm not gonna go in a corner and solke  i'm pass that
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00006.flac	who does better as a contestmant who performs the best and i said i
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00007.flac	your arieas of interest and exprtis if you know
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00008.flac	d well everybody thinks they know something about movies i said but you knw don't be embarrossed if you don't know the correct response
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00009.flac	as i have with people is name the for defendance in judgement at
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00010.flac	now i happen to know that and i've known that for a long time i don't know why those names have stuck with me but i happen to know
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00011.flac	and nobody else does nobody else cares which is fine but if that came up on a show and you didn't
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00012.flac	so what don't feel bad about it a mile hon ursanning preter oeter and vernr lumpy just in case
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00013.flac	some catagories that have failed yes and some that have succeded
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00014.flac	depends on the three contestants who are on the show that day you have a cattagoy that you think is dinamit di kno might jimmy walker
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00015.flac	well those three players didn't do well with it somebody else could have done couldhave moped the floor with his apponent uh in that cattagory so you never know and we try the writers god blesse them are really sharp
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00016.flac	uh i'm happy to see they one so mmmy so many mis because of their writing they can take a mundaine fact and
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00017.flac	make it light we're gonna do a category this year that we were i thought we were gonna do last year
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00018.flac	they gave me the games and i went over the games and one of the cattagories was when the astex spoke
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00019.flac	and the catagory was filled with cluws that had all of these astek words and welshwords it was a tong twisters
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00020.flac	and the game was going to ar aprel first aprel fools day so it was just anaprel fhools joke but i mentioned to a studio audience i was talking about this the other day and i
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00021.flac	after putting in i was really ticked at them because i put in a lot of minutes working on all those words and getting the the right uh dia chritical marks so that i'd give it the corecter
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00022.flac	and uh but it was just a joke for them so i said let's do it this year i'l be kindof fun and i said if i screw it up then i'll come after you with baseball bat sant uh break your neese
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00001.flac	a sense of reality you never wanna fake it you never want to be outside of the person you're petraying
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00002.flac	so if you're telling somebody's story which is what you do when you envodya
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00003.flac	verali so uh i you know that's that's my gig that's
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00004.flac	s but with in that interpretation i can ben those that i'll make you here
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00005.flac	and so i was delited that somebody saw me in a different way
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00006.flac	so uh and then i knew it was the people from the condring and with that petagru wll that's the that's the way to do it is to hop in
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00007.flac	net is a great sine matographer and i knew um telling a story
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00008.flac	to create movement but not the kind of obvious you know i
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00009.flac	i i think the the best ones is when you're mod is affected and you didn't see when it was happening and so i knew he would be able to bring that as an adit tool to drawing everybody into what seems like a story that they could be telling a reality from their own lives and they're next on neigbor's lives and before you know it they're often itd
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00010.flac	oh i  i m you know everybody thinks theire trevailes ore
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00011.flac	but um so that's all subjective but i have found piece because that's all we're all ever looking for in the things that we do y once we stop corrousing and
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00012.flac	still war off and i'm still feeling that we start to look for ways to uh
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00013.flac	i yeah  i hi i think it's there in our lives that's why we
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00014.flac	but i've also not had a lot of experiences how i'd react i don't know i think im
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00015.flac	that uh i uh i would see
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00016.flac	as a sobjective state and then that means i
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00001.flac	um so we watch the work that they do to make sure that uh the american homelin
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00002.flac	age uh but they also have a personal relationship uh that is very complex
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00003.flac	is that daily briefing book that the president gets every day this is the truth has the top ten most pressing security
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00004.flac	an homeland and so the amelis we never hear about them we started to talk and see things about the opratives but the amelis or the ones sthat have to sit and
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00005.flac	from around the world constantly chatter could be inernet chatter it could be anything that somebody saw ar prorceed you know that
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00006.flac	a lot they'regetting a lot of input over it langly constantly ihas to see a headquarters and so the annelist job is to is to
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00007.flac	's um she's come from the millitary she was a person that saw combat during desert storm doing the first one the first gulf war uh so she's experienced and we find it very interesting we have not had a millitary president since
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00008.flac	to explore and so constanc has she's at af calefornia
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00009.flac	follow portocalle and find out who's responsible for this attack and bring them to justice but as
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00010.flac	anything will be solved every week the episodes stand on their
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00011.flac	the the characters will keep unfolding as we go on and the storylines
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00012.flac	unfole and the complication of other parts of it will become even more
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00001.flac	well um i came to annabell which is u
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00002.flac	thriller i came to it because i was invited no one's ever asked
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00003.flac	do that jana before um and i im
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00004.flac	to do the same thing a lot but even in doing that i try to always
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00005.flac	um so we meet our beautiful couple
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00006.flac	and they live i think on the west side of los angelis and they have nagbors that they have
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00007.flac	awful acurente next door that slams right into the lives of
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00008.flac	people always say based on a true story but whatever has come out of a
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00009.flac	all kinds of images and thoughts and people that have flashed flashed flash so
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00010.flac	this type of story and annabell i it would depend so much on the sensibilities and the  of a of a really great siimatographer
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00011.flac	oh that is i't that head of yours this is just crazy then i would ask
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00012.flac	oh that is i't that head of yours this is just crazy then i would ask my
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00013.flac	prts and people and gamesas and everybody just wacken it out  there anyon
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00014.flac	she really every time they would give me the i dod't have to hope and it was like oh my god it w's like a big oll four year old how
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00015.flac	you know the way you know shes kinda put together but i also felt
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00016.flac	i don'tknow i just felt badly for annabe people were creeped out bire but
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00017.flac	i all love so i have not um i i've had no
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00018.flac	but all of our lives a's subjective o
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00019.flac	that's that's the reality um and we can tell their stories as well and we all like to hear each other stories
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00020.flac	i think one of hings that we're attracted to when we start to talk about the pare normal is that we get boared with what we can see ind
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00001.flac	they were very welcoming um apart from when they pushed me over and all stood on me
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00002.flac	i'm joking they 're incredibly welcoming i i pushd myself over the first day around on the enterprise they keep this flors very
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00003.flac	and um i had a little wedge built into my boot and i uh came bounding on the enterprise with all the energy jj wants you to have and i just went
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00004.flac	he was he was yeah i guess that gave me tempercenttreki  he was a fan of it he liked chattner i grew to really liked chatner actually and now um i loved chattner
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00005.flac	i watched the eighty two movie which yeh bb bes plays caral markes i i loved
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00006.flac	it's exactly what you' saying evehe he brings families together everywhere you know he has a u strong family of his own um his amazing kids amazing wife um he then goes on to set and makes us a family he makes us a family by starting every day with a big loud joke that he will like bomout sometimes he'll have everybody like just break into applors which being english i found really wiired i was like whate we abe
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00007.flac	nothink i was like oh naturally we all just epplored at nothing but he would and you know that's kind of a a a very like tribal primal way of uniting everyone and he just has a the ability to uniht he's a he's a leader i guess in a war he'd bed the uh
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00008.flac	yeah you know it's definitely complicated um making you sure that you preserve the integrity of the film and give people something to be surprised by but at the same time you just
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00009.flac	ea i was doing a play when i was twelve uh called twelve night i played a liviea and um i was in the middle of my like speech and i forgot where i was and i finished it and like i came back and realized where i was and then i thought that if it has the powers of like transportation if  you can be you out of your moment and back again then it's probably
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00010.flac	it was a very different experience to working with jj it was three of us it was stanly tnel and myself it was a very intimate experience
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00011.flac	was was an an intense and wonderful time actually he's a great mind and um the characters he he develops a intricate and multi lar so some velvhat morning is a movie i'm very proud of and stanliy tocie and i had a great tye
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00012.flac	uh lods of things you know i then went on to do a movie called coled comes the night with brian crancst and both of those men are such dignified agentleman um and stanly is very funny um i don't know i i i haven't i didn't realize how funny he was until i worked with him and brin is very serious detailed approach to his work so i learnt lighteness of touch from stanly every time we were like tget
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00013.flac	me and brin's a detaile focas sky which is why he was able to play a cemistry teacher on breaking
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00001.flac	hy are an amazing group of people that ous essemble and everyone has
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00002.flac	talent and depth of personality and generous spirit and
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00003.flac	and also a great privilege to be around so to have met everyone on this
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00004.flac	father who's no longer with us was a huge star trek fan of the
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00005.flac	s in  sixties which is what i went back and watched im preparation because it was the sort of advent and um
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00006.flac	so yeah so in oner of my grandfather is enough for me to be part of something that i know he was a fanal
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00007.flac	manity would sort of trees and bunnies but we would still feel and have spirits even if we were surrounded by mettle as we are now so i think it would be an oversight to miss that but it's very difficult to capture and to track an emotional story but that's jej
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00008.flac	that's the the the absolute motive is to find the the source of the
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00009.flac	and um the emotion and the gourney of each character and then on nhat the information comes
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00010.flac	thn that we sort of almost had a albetros round it's neck and um so
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00011.flac	super successful action film on all levels i mean not just successful in financial or hollywood terms but really successful ind rewarding
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00001.flac	it was a gut reaction cause it was actually um in we made it a couple of years agos you ma know and twas actually the best script i'd read that like ever ditin like eappral something it was the best script i'd read that year
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00002.flac	rong i don't really have a judgement on that actually but for right or wrong it still is and um i relateed to maybe if you don't want it to be howv
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00003.flac	i think she doesn't want it to be and i think it makes her hard inside and i don't think she'll ever recover
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00004.flac	like i remember i was i was hungry and and i was um tired u up one stage and i went and i had some
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00005.flac	play the price ou no there's no thert's no like magic to it it's exactly how you would imagine it being it's like oh my i'm naked ruing
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00006.flac	about the whole thing and he he didn't like when we were offset he was like we could both
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00007.flac	he didn't wanna like chat and whicheventually i i grew to cherish because it ment that like you were just coming together as these characters and um that made the whole process
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00008.flac	he's just a great guy like jim is and you know that i think when you're u an actor in you'r twenties i think so much of it is about being a great guy because you really are just like being who you are as an actor and you're twenties like him like in those these roles he plays if he was a
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00009.flac	he's go tos gofrin who he's been with for like four years a she was around and she was great
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00010.flac	right but we know he's got a great vois cause he did across the universe and he does yeah i know that's a whole other world it's not my world
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00011.flac	aus i was listening to george harrison and his voice was so like george
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00012.flac	writ well wen wrote it as well and that makes for a specific conbination i think when you have a writor director they're married to it in a way that um someone who like takes a script on
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00013.flac	and so it was very much about win was very clear about what he wanted and it was very much about like getting that for him and um it was very personal for wen as well i
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00014.flac	you know because he he's he's south africans he's not american and so he have to have a struggle to gan sdatas as well ad he
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00015.flac	inconation of waine and some some capasity i don't think exactly but i think so our relationship i think was quite personal for him andum so
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00016.flac	i mean yeah it's very it's it's an issue for everyone their imigration because imagration isn't just for the people who wanna go to the country that they wanna go to i's for the people who are in the country that are accepting the people into it and and then it's not just about people who wanna like live in a country but it's like so you have imigration lat say from mexico to chalefornia and then you have like torism from chalefornia to mexico so thethe
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00017.flac	tik that it's difficult for both parties on both ther recieiving end the hosting and and the kind of
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00018.flac	um compassionate about it i think that's the ke and i think when you read about the connadin the british imigration poliscese they're very compassionate in theire
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00019.flac	to um o the people who don't want people to emagratn i think that maybe um astralia an america a little more hard line about it
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00020.flac	i i can't say that it's harder for me as an english actress to um to get anywhere just because i think americans a very generous towards us and i  that's a wonderful thing for mean it's just dam hard as an actress prright i just i think it's just hard because um thereare a lot of you
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00021.flac	and um there arn't so many roles as there are for young men you know especially leading rolle and um so i think it's just as struggle as as as an as an artist as an
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00022.flac	is cool and i guess you can only be that cool if you were a carpent
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00023.flac	cool men like i he just walks around he's easy you don't feel like he's a star you don feel like he's um

id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00001.flac	because he was so he's such a an excentric man um i was always embarise because he wasn't the guy that was watching sports with my friends dads he was he was like in his basment trying to like figure out how to fix one of his reals and put it in the projector and he was like up tol three  am every night reading this

id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00012.flac	playing my mother she's a force but i swere i knew she was in my corner immediately she's very maturnal and she was
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00013.flac	she just said the wright things and she got me there and i sweare she literally slapt me intoh

id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00015.flac	inthe role um but i am so grateful for that because there's nothing i like reality i as much as you can do it without like hurting somebody i don't mind being slaped i because tit just really i m was real
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00001.flac	um i you know i don't remember i think i kind of just oh god i uh
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00002.flac	retibly born and i've had an amazing childhood and i grew up very close to menhatten and um
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00003.flac	for for for example she uh in the toa movies she made the guitars that they
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00004.flac	s incredible movie um but but you have to uh you have to know how to sa
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00005.flac	for me um i used to be singer i quit uh when i was seventeen biges wer read im m
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00006.flac	which makes it um you have to change your lifestyle for for to you know that diciplin is um is in saine but you get to be in the moment as an actor it's like super indulgent and uh i had the best time ever but um and also for the audience it mit connects them to the characters and and
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00007.flac	dhitrates you you drown yourself in and watter you always have to p
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00008.flac	you go home at night um and you you sit and wait till the next day because you don't wanna get sick
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00009.flac	there's so much going on in you'r in you'r vocal cords that um yeah you have to treat them like they're
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00010.flac	big fanno wisky and uh i'm i i uh i love middletin i had some middles an russel cro gave mes a middletin frorm my birth day i had some of that before i got here and then um you're lovely calleads uh
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00011.flac	i've never done a lit o television show or uh uhafter
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00012.flac	i i i'm i'm supernervous when i'm on stage i have stage for i i've never done in brodway show or show in general
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00013.flac	a heartful of love which is one of the iconic numbers where i get to hit a really high note and um and eddy read man and sma the barks are incredible uh my credible costars the best singers um they're singing
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00001.flac	i didn't really yea ou never seemed very holy to me at first it was just really really
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00002.flac	you i've never i've never seen a a story like that before really i mean i
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00003.flac	he movie that it was based on but ihad nd i had never seen it nore i mean had i read the script so of of
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00004.flac	boy it was so indriging because first of all i never got the opportunity to play somebody that's so complexe and so dark and
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00005.flac	and and uh and he knows the character so well so and at that poi
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00006.flac	we knew our characters at that point cause uh we had you know really there was a lot of
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00007.flac	uh when you're on set it's just the it's really account is really being able to
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00008.flac	ma me feel like i really fit in and i belong there and that was like the that was like the best gifts
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00009.flac	her o these scenes it was just like we were going at it as one as upposed tobe like
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00010.flac	not necessarily looking for love or looking to be loved but i think she hopes for it one day and she's really kind of just getting by i mean she's she
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00011.flac	meshe she got by you know she was able to make monney because she found this kind of sexual power
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00012.flac	things that happen and and then i think that throws cloveoff even more and and the osession comes i mean naturally because
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00001.flac	thleadership came from a place of empowering others and that was the entire movement was was going to these farmworkers men women and children who were were so uneducated so eliterate so unresorced and saying you can be your own change
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00002.flac	you don't have to wait for someone else to come and make the change for you and he gave them a way to um to find their voice and to use their voice and i think that that is the
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00003.flac	dream that we live in a country where the power is in the people
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00004.flac	what i found so interesting about dgo's vision for the film was to really humaniance seaser and to not
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00005.flac	make him to to kind of do away with the iconic heroic
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00006.flac	the gall was to make him feel like a maon like a mortel like you and eiy so that so that the audience watching it could see themselves in his struggle that heroes aren't born heros they
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00007.flac	and one way of achieving that was to depict him as a father and as aa husband as he was and and also to show the sacrifices that his family and those around him were asked to make in order to create that
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00008.flac	nineteen years old and so they really grew up together they formed their views and opinions of the world together as a partnership and they both lived this reality both of them were
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00009.flac	since they were children hellan since she was seven years old she was working in the fields so
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00010.flac	um this cause was deeply engraned in their relationship
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00011.flac	think that that  you know who can say what seaser would have accomplished with without hellin but um but i think that who he became and who hellin became was deeply informed by their marriage and their
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00012.flac	let theno watching this film would take so much pride and so much inspiration in what is possible in our communities you know
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00013.flac	in our communities and it's up to us to impower ourselves and for me that manefest itself
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00014.flac	and you know we are becoming the face of this country and for the issues that we care about
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00015.flac	disguste and talked about in the halls of power and for us to be a part of that conversation we have to clame that political presante and to me that means registering to vote getting into the minds of our communities and to our youth that that change will only happen when we show up for ourselves and so u you know if i had to say there was you know one first step towards
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00001.flac	we took a trip we do get along but i just always feel like vigus is the wrong choice
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00002.flac	like i was terrified it's not fun untill all of a sudden be in the midle of a magic show and and and my cast ot i was in on it and um and i wasn't and
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00003.flac	like asked me all these questions about myself and then had me right down a celebriti's name and then
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00004.flac	um and then like this uh stretch um humvlymmopldub and we were just gonna get in cabs but then like you're drunk and there's a humby lymmo and you're like that's a
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00005.flac	and and they're like it's fun it's only ten itjst you know ten box a head but then you take like a five minute ride and you pike two hundred
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00006.flac	but the the length of the ride was the length of hot lan bleng and we danced to that
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00007.flac	imploys who were at a big box walmart like stor and the
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00008.flac	like stor and the chanannagins they get into and their relationships and it's
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00009.flac	people were tweating me like oh no americais doing walmart
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00010.flac	i this wonder was like oh thank god is the show i was super concerned
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00011.flac	touched by the concern and i was like thank you for your concern i'm fine but also like i'm pretty sure a walmark nastional like adwould
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00012.flac	rbest i'm all about it but the best like whereever i am if i'm waring that vest people ask me where things are like people think i work wherever i am
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00013.flac	re coming in and out and they be like excused me where's this i'm like i don't werk hare they're like sho
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00014.flac	and and then by the end it was like dasix i'm like the toilet papers an il fo like i i knew it was there
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00001.flac	very happily and then there's an outside conflict that involves people who don't believe in that way of life of bikings writing dragons so that comes to sort of threaten pickup way of life and theries ar fikings and dragons and lots of
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00002.flac	but uh uh hickup finds his long lost mother who's voiced by kcate blanchet um and there's really they're a a couple other incredibly
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00003.flac	and kid harinton uh comes and stars in u as a arits son of arid
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00004.flac	feel uh romantic vibe in their relationship but
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00005.flac	um and hick up you know this is definitely a coming of age story for hickup and hick up his coming into his own as all all of the characters are and he is moving towards
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00006.flac	having to step into the role of chief and for astra that that is a very natural
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00007.flac	hion hole hartedly with no quams about it and hick up is more of a reluctant
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00008.flac	hero he doesn't know that that's right for him so that's his journey and and astread is is ah just a different person then him they have kind of different beliefs but
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00009.flac	that uthat the that the whole audience no matter how young er old you are enjoys the experience i mean it's a beautiful experience one of my my favorite parts of the film are the the the writing sequences because they're just they just transport you to another place and
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00010.flac	you feel like you're there in the middle of it but the story is deep and and and quite touching and so hopefully you know those old enough to really go with that story will will really appreciateet and and
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00011.flac	it's will um hove fun and i also think you know are never to be undrestimated with how much they can
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00012.flac	and den our writer director was not afraid to to to really let the story go where it had to go and trust that the audience um no matter how young gorld
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00013.flac	y different this time around d the first time no one knew what to expect and now there's this beloved audience that has high
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00014.flac	you know i have to say for myself i was a big fan of the first one and i was blown away with the second film so i think
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00015.flac	i'm just excited to see what comes out of den's imagination i mean after the first film it was so satisfying it was hard to imagine where it was gonna
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00001.flac	it but it was yeah i was going to o wedding with my boyfriend at the time and i
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00002.flac	was in like my mid twenties and just was like i really hate this and um i can't do it like i can't be this social with this many people for this long
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00003.flac	and then but getting to a place where i didn't think something was wrong with me and that i thought it was okay and i actually kind of like i really like that i know that i need time on my own to
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00004.flac	for the bar minamam i can't do a weekend a full weekend
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00005.flac	i mean iand you know my friends are still getting married i'm like we're thirty five can we stop like whyere people still doing this um but
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00006.flac	um hopefully i have access to a room but i have done that ihave like sat in a starbux bathroom and just sat on the floore and just takeng a mit nobod
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00007.flac	to uh when we were filming tranrected to jud apita and i id lik
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00008.flac	like i just noticed  what am i doing so i just made sure not yu
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00009.flac	donnel trump doesn't pay his workers he won't release his tax his taxes there's never
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00010.flac	uh an num and he who's ever not released ther taxes so um and
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00011.flac	i don't think you can have a i haven't had a conversation with anyone who doesn't like hillery where they've had anything meaningful to
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00012.flac	too spain for somewhere it's it's it's
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00013.flac	it was not like sex within a relationship and you're stleving to someone knew most likely it doesn't go well
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00014.flac	oly flew all the way here i'll just like drink enough that my body
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00015.flac	than i'll have sex with this guy ucause i fel like i owed him something
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00016.flac	hand i think as a young woman you might get confused about that so
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00001.flac	doin your kids and so the boys somehow talked to send o that we were gonna flash them  you know they had a really good argument like do it and
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00002.flac	and all the boys looked at me and i didn't not have the biggest boops at all of the crew
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00003.flac	for for my whole life i'm always the i fealing too much like oh i thought we were all admitting eal thing bout ourself like no
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00004.flac	like walking hipocrets i think pretty much like we there's so many sides to all of us and i i'm you know very um charged politically and i really care about the world but that doesn't mean that i don't go home and watch every real house wives nyou know and every batchalarret it's just
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00005.flac	i think and we were timig out the scale it's just so strange t people always they'll say um i usually don't like female comics but you'r okay and i'm like would you go up and say i don't usually like black
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00006.flac	lookni just it's i think a specification that doesn't need to be made because some people they'l say you're
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00007.flac	i was thirteen years old yeah and so just like with my stand up before i talk about anybody on stage or uh you know if ri'm being rea anything i clear it
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00008.flac	oi asked my mom she read it i said if you don't mean to write andy f it i won't if you wanna writ a respond sorof correct anything and uh the only corection she made was that uh hebr school was on
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00009.flac	think it just seems like very tiring to have them um
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00010.flac	you know usually something happens but i really try to just enjoy the moment and high you're feeling now
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00011.flac	yeah i  you know the last note of my o if you uin kis you don't have any joes in your life when you have
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00012.flac	do a good job but then everybody laughed and then i laughed and it was like ol that's better than if it had
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00001.flac	hso i kind of just think of the worst thing or the funniest thing  i could say in a situation
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00002.flac	yeah yeah so min a little bit better but um and then describing my humor that's hard if you ware gonna describe yourself as a
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00003.flac	uh softmore year of college so when i was about nineteen twenty
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00004.flac	the parts of my family are really autobiographical and so i wanted to just kind a get the story and and of a girl like this like a woman
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00005.flac	i judged and i were were working on the script
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00006.flac	he heard me onhoward sturn that radio show and wanted to meet just have a general
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00007.flac	i've heard him say that he thought that i'm someone he'd wantna follow around and see what they do during the day
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00008.flac	he encouraged me to rite a movie which i had never done and and so he was we were kind af collaborating through the whole process i was sending him scenes
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00009.flac	he encouraged me to rite a movie which i had never done and and so he was we were kind af collaborating through the whole process i was sending him
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00010.flac	i don't remember thinking that there would would be a bunch of mal
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00011.flac	and yeah actually was more judscall you know wonder what's going on there but i think you're right i feel like we all grew up you know with the mal gays kind of born into us and we're used to
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00012.flac	slow panup from the woman's heel and then you know a guy it's kind of shocking to see it a guy with out all is close on cause we're not used to that but um it's a nice
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00013.flac	u he really found that character on his own it was written that
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00014.flac	gonna be a guy who cares about working out a lot and he's more intome than im into him but then he sort of he really created his own character and and just took the script and around with it and
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00015.flac	we have been here before we came here and uh i think we just went to like innerlock and and smoked a bunch of hash
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00001.flac	deeply deeply upset and i like in a vstral like personal way and i was very confusedcause i've never been through in a viction i'v never but i somehowe knew what it was i somehow understood in a in a emotional personal
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00002.flac	werso by doing that we're exciling parts of ourselves that uh we that the that the culture doesn't deam uh worthy because uh you know if we
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00003.flac	it's that there's a fear that we're going to be exciled ourselves entirely or rejected which is what this part of the story is about
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00004.flac	ante avicting are not happy the people who are being avicted are definitely not happy it's a culture that it's
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00005.flac	people against each other and uh stripping us of our ability to create real community and it's well it's making it's not it's awe we still have the ability it's just really hard work to care for each other in the
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00006.flac	um where the imagination gets you out of whatever situation you're in
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00007.flac	um it's it's it's usually if there are two two easy options out
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00008.flac	and yeah tragic um well it goes back to what does ou culture value um it values
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00009.flac	um that's uh that kind of again exciles and devalues
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00010.flac	all of the abundent beauty that the world has and uh
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00011.flac	it's very very limited and it's very narrow and surductive yeah there's there's a lot of surduction that goes on an
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00012.flac	that we um are told to worship you know you can tell the religion of a of a city or of a town by the taulest building um so we know what that is in
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00013.flac	things that we're told make us worthy human beings if we are on the top floor of that building or if our bank balence is aso
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00014.flac	bulshipi'm sorry it's s i don't know if you can us that it's bullshi though it's um it's uh it's uh it's it's death of a salesman it's relly lomannism it's uh it's this it's this fulc
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00015.flac	that uh more is better um it's it's you know superscized me it's all these it's all this kind of madness um that that tht that we're going to ward um so yeah with within the tethe industry of hollywood yeah there's
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00016.flac	noi have i i and i know that i know what that is i know what it is to be tempted
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00017.flac	no i actually just would like to be who i am and i like you to be who you are
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00001.flac	i i i i i i i watched it more from a like you know inspiration stand point than than from  uh sexual
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00002.flac	an inspiration from anywhere um and when when it comes to this character cause it's everyone it belongs to
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00003.flac	i hasn't really started yet you know when the film comes out it's gonna be a different thing the comi con thing was a big important thing for me
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00004.flac	about just going to commicone and and being and being subjected to to
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00005.flac	to make sure that everyone knew that i was just then and i were all the same and that i'm
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00006.flac	that uh that that's able to you know ththat that that  has a that has a kind of defense
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00007.flac	a a difficult difficult to access aspect um so so there  there was that and and you know there there's so much demention to peter parker es he's i think he finds a a confidence when hwhen he finds his power and
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00008.flac	peda parker is he's i think he finds a a confidence when he when he finds his power and that
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00009.flac	a kind of a rebelliousness that um that he hadn't ben able to acess before um and the rebellious not only comes u
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00010.flac	um you know finding out trying to find out who the hellhe is but also afther his uncle dyes there's something um about that sychologically that you wanna run away from and hat ou wantna kick out against cause he feels
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00011.flac	coo william spenser um in in pn im an utub and and you'll find his his his skate reals and you'll be
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00001.flac	yeah i mean it's it's very very strange being a part of a film that um people like you know uh it's it's uh when you make a film i think um you you put all your care and your passion into it as a collective group of people and then um you have to kind of accept that people may may may dislike o or hate it in fact so so so when people respond on mass in a in a positive way tit can't really be um exgnored and you and you ou have to
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00002.flac	images of of i don't know you know car explosions in a you know the the the usual thingis that we go
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00003.flac	es for but uh of course then you you hear ar in salking in david fencure or involved in the movie in summers in in some way and you kind of go well the pretty smart guys and and i'm gonna trust the the the
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00004.flac	but it just kind of flew bey it's just and all the script as in the film like word for word like it's all there very very fast so yeah it was incredibly
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00005.flac	funright yeah yeah yeah but uh yeah yeas absolutely but at the same time i you know i i feel like um comminc books ar are
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00006.flac	kind of mathology are gree mathology like a modern kind of greak mthology and i i kind of aquate the themes um and i and i
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00007.flac	he thins you'll yo'll find in shakespeare or in esclis or you know in in these um tragities ind these greak tragities so uh i feel like all of the the the the same human themes are are in theree and uh it's it's it's just under a different kind of
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00008.flac	you kind af go wall this is gonna be great and and but then of course in n in practice it's obviously a great deal of hard work and and a gea deal of pressure and
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00009.flac	imen a lovely message through a mutual friend and uh he had i he he gave me his support and it ment a great
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00010.flac	got to the monaters and and watch where i've done because i get very self conscious and id like to kind of like not know what i'm my eibrows are doing all the stupid thing that
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00011.flac	i think people care about the books so much and of course it's very difficult to adapt um such a belovied piece of piece of writing into sinamatic form and and it's jus very
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00012.flac	i'm i' yeah of course i'm if if i i i think it probably does um my dad's american and my mum's british so i've had both accents in my ear so that
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00001.flac	y the uh n m convents thei're great uh but it's te firstime i've done bellfast so it's lovely to be
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00002.flac	sure yeah i think the last london one i did i think there was uf a hundred
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00003.flac	noother moment i mean if if be invii've been einvited over to florider i think ut i couldn' make tha as i was filming i've never bee invitedd the sondygo

id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00009.flac	you've gotta be in it to in t y so um and you do learn you know when i when i started iv o actin since i was seven and thorty five u know um and i was terrible i
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00010.flac	and be open be open minded and also i i think be
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00011.flac	the most success i've had careear wizse is when i've stood out
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00012.flac	embraced what i was as a person and and was able to bring that to the screen ndin
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00001.flac	and th yeah i thought e i mean it's a funny one isn't it cause  you know the fans are gonna be
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00002.flac	that you go yeah in the drama you don't know hat anybody could go if he's gonna go  then anybody could go and um but you know he was orl
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00003.flac	gota thing back from my ege and went they really loved you but they didn't believe anything you said caus you pronounced
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00004.flac	coner and abia in the show you know they i surprising lhy take to it very quickly you know we have that
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00005.flac	doblin um they decided to make our own versions of the tranquilize guns which wis
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00006.flac	yeh so they kinda made these gose but yeah the the art designer and it was amazing they they they were
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00007.flac	and yeah some of the stuff they used as well to make the show look very cool in sifer you wouldn't you know i'm talkingt
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00008.flac	they might uhthey might revisit it we'll see we shell see so it wouldn't
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00009.flac	who for instance they had a lot of practical things you know and maybe less
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00010.flac	it it's genuinely really something out of a hore film and i thought the episode
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00001.flac	heo he was brilliant in the place  the theater we had e glss gowas amazing as well a is a proper light sinnamer um and the response was brilliant so het was he was lovely actually  premar two episodes actually in glass go and it's always gone down really really
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00002.flac	iseen to like it uh bu it's  it's nice as well cause uh it was kinda lose a big episode he plays pickc and sheis from
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00003.flac	mnts for that so when people watch it about the gu oh right kay yeah wa so but it came out i love
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00004.flac	yeah basically it's ah jis grase cop goes back to work hes collee's not like him he's bitmade a bit  his bit of a manr made a bit of a mess of his career and he goes back to work and he gets partnered with an  unit called unic white who's experimental and he just sees it as a baby siting job he think so because you don't like me i've been given looki after
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00005.flac	crack piece of teck um and basically yunit why is uh yeah talking car but she swilessly connected to anything so that s what makes he kind of interesting thet even more interestig thing about her is that she's been given ta thing al the pulse and the pulse inables her to feel and learn emotion so that means she develops
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00006.flac	um so within the it's al seton one day within the day she will go through every sot of human emotion that we've had to deal with them in our life in one day and have to get over each one as they come up create problems and feed into the next one and it's about them tob working together to to survive the day from the
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00007.flac	the scene weh i can't give too much away but uh we
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00008.flac	in my mind exactly um so i do try and keep things
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00009.flac	to go from here to to the screen obviously some times you can't get it that way sometimes things work better and it's no whaty you expected um but yeah i know i'm a bit like a conductor when i ed it i knoi know thi sounds weird but i'll stand back and i'll be like the points and  it's a it's i it's got a lot of music in it and that's very import an to the pase ins  and literally i'll i'l
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00010.flac	lie c conductto when i ot  goin it and  like that's that point that's that point that works that makes you laugh that doesn't you know it's very
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00011.flac	when i show it for the first time i i am nervous i'm not nervous about putting out an line i'm o nervous about showing it like to me
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00012.flac	yu know i i do a lot of my work in stuf i do i've always done from my kinda family and stuand that's you know as much as everybody else is apin an is is is reallyn
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00013.flac	whether the gambets are al good or abod whether they're be an infil trited you know who's controling them
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00014.flac	so the story just i mean owe know what we do in we know exactly where it's gonna end up um and it will be all explained in the end um but yeah in in a way because
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00015.flac	um but hopefully when you sit back and watch it al  you know e
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00016.flac	a friend of mine rachel h i just did a movie with um she uh cause we've only just met she watched it ol in one go so and she said it was
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00017.flac	was like how how long od  take tur like o about an oor in haf i was li oh i' made about an owr in after tvi
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00018.flac	but there's a backstory between cro and uh
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00019.flac	thi why it's the i think he's a man at the moment is  cro and he's pretty much dealing with it as i happens but like for an instance when rebecka go's given me a m flat keeber cand he's like
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00020.flac	we's in the ca prbably not lain the car s ahis pro his pocket sr he doesn't want to detatch
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00021.flac	and ther little storys got somewhere to go as well but there's there's gonna be some switch in op there's gonna be some betrar going on very soone and hopefully some
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00022.flac	idon't the probary is a lot but i can't think off the top of my head um i mean we we wrote this story inou heads a long time ago and it's not
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00023.flac	it's not really gone off track in a sense we knew the ark of each character  n that hasn't changed much but it has been
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00024.flac	ou is ithis tru bu but what we came with that i that actually opened another door
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00025.flac	try and get my sister into it that opened another daughter another character wheche opened another dater we a
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00026.flac	side of a relationship which it actually made it better in the long
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00001.flac	but uh so i just o aditioned and uh uh and uh that's wiming pool
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00002.flac	i mean i i'd read some of the stories yeah i think the guys who write at mark gages and steven off it are huge um ah urluck an to enthusiast you know so i think
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00003.flac	sful is because there there's nothing cynical about it you know they love it they they they know all the versions of itand  and so i think
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00004.flac	don't think people thought that they were gonna see me as morreority i don't think the the tvve audience had any relationship with shar facewhich i think kind a hell
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00005.flac	you know that it wasn't a a a tv face at uh at uh at the time and um uh so yeah i think you gotta just look at you know the the dark side of your own self so then you can sort of create something that's a little bit more original you know um and i think they're very clever in that they don't overuse the character you know a litte bit like hanabl lector i think if you he's only in twenty minutes of of the silence of the lams i think it's it's it's the talking about i minute's the it's the um it's he
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00006.flac	think i think going with that i think if you're gonna gonna be adatious an cast somebody like me in in in that in that in that character you might as well go the whole hou
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00007.flac	i don't i don't think you kd uh we couldn't have uh for seen how how successful  i always knew that it was gonna be a  a a aa big
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00008.flac	fantastic he's uh  both of us um uh kindo came from the theater you know uh i think u i think because we were both you know in ou early thirdies when when shurlock started and so i think it's quite good for actors to
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00009.flac	do things that you don't really want to do and you starte going after things for the for the wrong reasons and um yeah i think we had ten years i knew benedict uh as a as a theater actor for for years or end it the scene and uh so yeah ii think the quality of the writing and tit tha the sort of theatrical natur of the right o really help just i think he's a i think he's a real real star and he's a great pow and to  you
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00010.flac	he got the ocasional he get the ocasional ud uh person ye uh but no for the most part
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00011.flac	things you know people really like atd it' sold to two hundred and twenty countries  all around the world so and
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00012.flac	yeah we we last year we shot him a film called the stag o him u a film with
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00013.flac	ted up the dob oblin um um mountains and it's abote um kind of marder and il irish males um people hve beenasking me recently if it's if it's like the kind of the irish orisin of the hang over
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00001.flac	i i think i i i think the the o older i get an well naybe not the ol i've always been a bit um uh quite physical you know i think of things sort of words i love words you
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00002.flac	so watching watching myself and um so when we sawt the screemn first to mea o
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00003.flac	help n i don't think that would help i think youd have to try and sort of forget about it so i  i well i don't well i i i i  haven't watch
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00004.flac	yeah yeah yeah but it's a it is a it's a it's a really interesting thing but no i don't i i wouldn't
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00005.flac	that' said a great mistake that you make when you're casting something
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00006.flac	u sort of um i i i kinship with that and a of course i think about my own family and peopl
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00007.flac	yeah i think it's i think  i think actors can sometimes move too far away from that that's what you're supposed to that's what you're supposed to have chieefly is u is an imagination and i feel that if
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00008.flac	o the opposite of of love isort of and um yeah so if you've gott an imagination you can if you use yourself you know and that's maybe why i don't do too much um looking at
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00009.flac	i if that happened to me if there's something awful like that happened to me and trying not to act or how would i be if i was a if i was asi
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00010.flac	e it can't be anything but your own and that's what i think you knowone's
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00011.flac	well when i first read it i was like it's a really it's a thing where you know when you have to do a job because you like
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00012.flac	in uh in the jerowood sbaseon and simon came to watch it and lie
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00013.flac	remember that very very clearly actuay because i remember think you'd have to give all your energy to see wa um but yeah thar's at's otan
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00014.flac	yeah itwas tiring when we did it at the edberof ft festival i found atiring because we  we had to do it at nine um in the morning
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00001.flac	um mack denb uhn his cod name  sc who is the new um head of an organization called c an which is the center for
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00002.flac	yeah he's one of those guys i he's uh he's h he's he's quite uh pasan he's not lacking in um uh self confidence uh i mean he's intelligent ol i think those guys
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00003.flac	you know we all uh our little fearful u i think ing the dgitle age and um so yeah he's uh he said
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00004.flac	uh and of course uh you know we have to we have to embrace the tecnology that we have because it doesn make things safer but und the idea of just training cameras on everybody had
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00005.flac	unnecessarily is uh his questionable and should be questioned ond uh so it was important that we had an i an idea that was sort of a rational idea that dat actually sn' he's not
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00006.flac	really really agree with some of the ideas of of seeness in the film am i'm not sure that i would myself personally but uh there's there's an argument to be sed for to be had for um for some of the things he
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00007.flac	it was one of one of the things that i was um quite scared ove a lot of the films and that iv don o been sort of more loky and more independent films and  bit of theater in everything and so my worry a littlebit
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00008.flac	you get sort of lost in a in the huge multy millian dollar yum action movie that bond
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00009.flac	in your door and s o what iv we what if we make sure we have to beat here and then i felt that i could speak at any stage about saying you know
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00010.flac	don't want to be bullied no matter what the budgedal of it is an to doing something
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00011.flac	um uh faikness or stuff that they've sort of seen before so i feel like it's important that that that the new ancisom stuff is uh um remains
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00012.flac	i feel like it's important that that that the new ances of stuff is uh um remains an
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00013.flac	i i know some we did a play together some years ago on broadwayand that's how we how we met and i think uh that thatthat's the same with a lot of the actors and and bond their rife rife and danal himself and ben wih shol rekineeare and they're all
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00014.flac	an actually what i love about uh spector when you see it is that that that sort of meluncolly that done your har in
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00015.flac	certainuh um tat you have one much larger budget and you're shooting it in pinewood i mean it doesn't sort of escape escape you that you you're in this balls o amy five um but actually after a few days i mean the i i always say the first couple of da
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00016.flac	fw days uh no it was just like making another film and you go ho do you make it right and um and at takes us much it's it's exactly the same um method does it as is
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00017.flac	secrt yeh it's all that's that' uh anyway uh dos hat the small stuff is i sa but it is yeah you just not
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00018.flac	i hope to yeah i think my fome yare coming over and it's a big old deal an uh yeah no it's important tt the it can be quite
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00001.flac	his time off uh returning baby birds who had fallen out of the nest back to the
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00002.flac	it's pretty great i i i as i like to say well because is california i dressed like a todlor

id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00006.flac	like a teager i couldn't fokes a my bloss had talke to me and i could think was like the president think
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00007.flac	he'd been choing gum right before iy i think it was razels so i
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00008.flac	it wasn't always sexual but it was physical cause we'd restl a lot
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00009.flac	he'd spell words on my back with his finger and i have to best what it was o om he' fellt tickle and i his tickle and
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00010.flac	well yeah that's literally having sex with a
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00011.flac	mhy hands are small i know but they're not yours they are my
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00012.flac	i forget it like sorry i'm not quoting the andreues sister richard
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00001.flac	i don't think any of us could engage with that i don't think we could engage with what lammas has been the histeory of it
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00002.flac	it stature i think we all came in knowing what our own feelings about the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00003.flac	uh were and our own love for it  i think we just wanted to honer the stat the the statue that has had in our own lives i think that was kind of where we began and that was the thing that motivated us
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00004.flac	knew the show backwards i learned the show when i was a kid and so you know i i remember i used to sit on my um my stairs
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00005.flac	there's is something about it that that is so liberating and and fun and
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00006.flac	it wasn't it wasn't it just seemd really exciting to me you know because i don't i i don't ive ie i i traditionally have not enjoyed movies when there's play back i think
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00007.flac	thati'vever seen really nale at is maryiang cotyard and in a levion rose and uh maybe jammy fox and and and you know ray and things like that but but a lot of times i don't know it can kind of had as have a stultifying effect on on the proceedings and i think
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00008.flac	things were un expected feel like you ouldn't  quite get comfortable with it because you didn't kow whatw'sgonna happen next
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00009.flac	andyou know i think that i had opportunities ind the in performing it in film that a lot of actresss don't have
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00010.flac	excit you have to project to the back of the audience you know an idea that you have you know your character has a thought you must project the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00011.flac	ou kow to the cheep seats and i just think on on film you don't have to put that much efort into it you can kind of sit back and make it a little bit more conversational but ithink that's always the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00012.flac	there was i wish there were more but there was one definite moment when
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00013.flac	it's the sort of thing where the ocut and you remember that you're acting you're likeoh no im i no i'm back now i
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00014.flac	and i and i it was a gorgious soundtrack to have that moment to and it made me feel u weirdly enough itshoul hvemade me feel more silly but i actully if it made me
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00015.flac	for huge jackman that we can finally see so many of his gifts on this place still not all of themthere's no dancing in this one and the man can dance and um vhelgohn whell he has a certain charm is not as charming as huge jackman
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00016.flac	all of the things that you can do that's they're so rair to find i one performer onthe
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00017.flac	and i know he would joined m in saying the biggest surprise at this entire experience was reallso cro i've never
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00018.flac	digan deeper or work harder and i think the film is so lucky to have his
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00019.flac	this could be a really bad idea why did i agree to this i had a lot of my friends wo were actress is just kindof
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00020.flac	to do it i needed it to be real um i i i've i've kind of intellectualized why but this
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00021.flac	o feeling um i knew it was gonna be more meaning ful because and whatc her sacrifice is so meaning ful and i just thought if we did it for real people migt
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00001.flac	just the audition process it was you know first it was rumors that chriss was considering a knew female character and then it was okay so he's gonnameet with a couple girls and then it was then he told me what the character was and then it was wether or not you were gonna be one of the irls invited to screen test so it was  three in a half month process so by the time i
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00002.flac	i was it just seemed like it it couldn't possibly happen i mean i'd i'd i'd loved the
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00003.flac	and then i went to set and it was one of the best experiences i've ever had working on a movie
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00004.flac	i didn't even know it was because it i mean there 's something chris chris got a star in the hollywood walk af fame today and
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00005.flac	an it just didn't seem possible that it would be a reality in my life and so then
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00006.flac	i thought this would happene to me and it's the same thing you just don't imagine that because machel fifers performance is so iconic um you just don't think that that opportunity wi'll ever come up again and the fact that it did while i was the righte age i just it's kind of minde blowing but it's it's a it'sit's  it's a postum it's after the fact it'
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00007.flac	wated me to do and a lot of the fighting styles and christ had said he wanted me to do all of the things that uh that i could um and i'm a hyper competitive person so i was like i'm gonna do it all i'm do everything um so it was about getting myself
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00008.flac	a deep and o the sounds weird because there shouldn't be degrees of althanticity but he's a deeply authentic person very very much
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00009.flac	himself he's one of thes martest people i've ever met and he's just a
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00010.flac	i loved him instantly and i still do i think he's adorable and um and the's just such a great great great great actor i just every day was
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00011.flac	from the people that i work with i mean especially when you're in this kind of company i mean i i remember coming in one day and i saw joan an like hey you had that scene with oldman the other day h
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00012.flac	but it was uh i mean it was a master class every day everybody that you saw work and everybody had
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00013.flac	i you know everyone comes from such different backgrounds but somehow everyone found the same
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00014.flac	really good person um he's a wonderful father and so i think he's able to uh be amidst ube in the midst of caoss and keep his cool um and he's also just
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00015.flac	he's he's h's kindof too good to be truge v everything about this film he drinks a lot of t he drinks a tehe drink a tremendous amount of tee i believe that's the secret
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00016.flac	the camera test and i still had a wais to go before i was happy with it but i did have a moment were i was standing with um tom who was in the full baine get up and then christian was wearing the bat sute and i was just as cat woman and i said this is either going to work spectacularly or we're going to look like rejexs from
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00017.flac	and that wen that one not desimilar to this one where you just couldn't believe the talent that was around you um and how professional and hard working everyone is
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00018.flac	and it was very scary to to go to ome of te places i had to go to as this character but um i had so much support and i  it's
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00001.flac	ambitious and potentially wonderful film i i jus thought the screen play was incredible and so incredible that i forgot to focus on my character and i jut thought oh wamoa who is she who is she i supposed to give chris an answer about this
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00002.flac	ot the movie i love that it trusts in the inteligence of its audience you know it's a challenging film it's challenging to to  thinkits gonna be challenging intellectually but it's also challenging emotionally and so far all the reports that we've gotten back are that people feel transported by the journy they feel opend because of it and people seem to be responding to the film which is great cause that's the way i felt when i first read
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00003.flac	it would give away uh i can i i play an astrya biologist i'm a lowd o talk about that and i am part of the
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00004.flac	to save man kind but i can't tell you what from what or where we're going or anything else
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00005.flac	it is it is it's a very well we're trying to protect people's uability to enjoy
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00006.flac	it was ait was i had a great time working with him as a as a person and as an actor
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00007.flac	um he cares about what he does so much and
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00008.flac	to because it's the way i like to do things but he also you know in between
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00009.flac	amazing stories you know he's a he's a he's a person who's really lived his life and
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00010.flac	i started off the film with a great sense of admeration for him and honestly iat increased every single day and to the point where now he's he's just one of my favorite people i i'm i'm a big belivor in mathe
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00011.flac	um how did i go bck i mean i just i looked at the film and i looked at the lines that i had i n a lot of which were science paced and i just thought okay sou have to understand what it is that you're saying to the best of your ability so i just worked really hard atd exploring the concepts i thought about ecause the movie is not really about her person even though she's a big part of the film and uh she goes on an emotional journey but that's not necessarily crucial to the film either but i had to know what it was that i was doing so i worked very hard
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00012.flac	in uh creating a backstory for her that uh that i could then that would then inform my
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00013.flac	i don't know oh io' i i i would not presume to to say that um he loves
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00014.flac	this film um he's exolent at making great films but i think the person that he is is a father you know i think that's probably the most
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00015.flac	an amazing father um from as far as i can tell he's a wonderful husband do his wife i'm atomus who's also is producing partnr
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00016.flac	and a deeply thinking really compassionate human being and that's not something you necessarily put together a lot of times when people are deep thinkers they they can be intimidating or judge mental or maybethey don't suffer fools gladly chris is a man of enormous patients and i i
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00017.flac	ou kow the beginning i was intimidated to go to him with problems with the character causethe din't wanna bug him but he's really not that sort of person he um he's pretty approachable as at
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00001.flac	you got to see bella grow up and you get to see the progression of her kind of turning in to a woman and and getting married and you know having children and dealing with forever and um you know i think it's a beautiful thing and
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00002.flac	something that's very relatable so um i'm really excited for everyone to kind of
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00003.flac	you know alis collan she's purky and sing songing and um and very loving and welcoming and uh
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00004.flac	you know wat points become a little sasy and at points become very dangerous and so um i kind of feel
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00005.flac	vdmental picture um and being able to kind of let that play acrosst your eiyes and and a lot of people to see you really seeing this thing happening in your mind um and i had you know help definitely working with bilcon and saying what do you think about this idea what do youthink about this what should shod be seeing because there's a lot of greayars and that because i can't see the future an so uh there was a lot of time spent you know making sure we kind of agread on
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00006.flac	process every day um that is the one thing that i'e probably will not this is the contacxt because you culdn't see anything but um i will say you know it took about two hours every day and i will say the one positive thing about all that was that um ione it completely transformed you and i think they you know people oer
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00007.flac	they love the books and i love this character alise and they wanna see alis and so it's it was really cool to kind of bring her to life every day um but i think also that process kind of forces you to um be become these vampires and because we didn't have perfial vision i think it kind of caught us off a little bit from the world and
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00008.flac	and just gave us more of a sense of being uh cold and
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00009.flac	my life has changed since i started twiligt except for my friends and family um which i think they keep me grounded in saine but it's been i mean it's just been amazing and kind of a world wen and um i think every day ha's been a new adventure and you never quite know what's gonna happen and it's kind of presented so many opportunities that i um
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00010.flac	i mean i can't imagine my life without twilight now but uh i couldn't have drumed this upr imagined you know that i was gonna be a part of something that was
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00011.flac	penugh i do um feel very flattered at and excited that you know there could potentially be a spent off for alis because i love the
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00012.flac	just as much as everybody else and um and i think it would be a really fun thing um but of course
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00001.flac	so i read it and um i just really responded to the material and um i responded to the film as a whole and
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00002.flac	kind f strong yet bronable character she's kind of both sides and um i kind of liked her she was kind of
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00003.flac	alo th on the wold moreso than sm a character so it was really drum to her
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00004.flac	o um love ast heartbreak trying to go from
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00005.flac	dulthood and having to adapt um i think to the change that was happening and um and so i i loved it said i you know would love to mek th diractor on this and so i went in and rud
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00006.flac	they thankfully responded to me as well and then i had to go back in and kemmisued and
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00007.flac	of yeah and it was you know one of those things where it was so organic and easy and sumple and we just
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00008.flac	it was in shreekpoart louesianna we only shot at actual small part in texis um but they felt that creep woare had enough of the
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00009.flac	it was kind of osome bit um but no really was not familiar with the adies and um one of the best things that the producers actually in director did was they gave um the
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00010.flac	they would potentially use or um that was relevant or that they you know remembered from their past time and so that was really nice to have
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00011.flac	volved um so that was uh very helpeful and then you know we had conseltutions with hair and makeup and and the war drove stuff like that but um but no before it wasn't really uh
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00012.flac	fun like boning experience and um you know we kind of lived out some of the
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00013.flac	i mean i mean i'm very thankful for that because he was playing my brother and it made hit very easy um to really genuenely care
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00014.flac	i mean it's huge landwise but it's that kind of a little bit of the small talementality an and a bit sothern and so um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00015.flac	i don't think to the extreame of what you see in scateline i definitely kind of have a tast of at
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00016.flac	i wint but tot that and the ice kiting ring weing ot for a long time i think in the middl
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00017.flac	hen know himself anymore uh in the mol the mosteen where he brings me and ie
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00018.flac	anthat whole thing uh we had to do that scene i porticular had to do um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00019.flac	in a modelin class and i just kind of they also had commercials and acting and so i just kind of
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00020.flac	you know because it's tough trying to to pay rend an alae but um but i started in
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00021.flac	in a modelin class and i just kind of they also had commercials and acting and so i just kind of you know went from one to the next and then um when i was likex sixteen i just
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00022.flac	look for so long just to get any kind of partan so um you know after that started happening i was just i wanted to work and i was
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00023.flac	done much before twilight and so everything that i did do was knew and something i hadn't played before
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00024.flac	nrnd a different character and so um you know they'reall coming out this year and i think it i'll be
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00025.flac	we are in the midst of it we're coming towards the end of of
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00026.flac	r different parts of of canada um but then we'll we'll rapp out there an whel be done
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00027.flac	each of the films have been severely different and they have very um i think different themes and and um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00028.flac	nt be darker than others and um and some mens be more magical than others and i think um that you know they've done a really good job it kind of sulecting a
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00029.flac	in the film and so they've all been very severely different
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00030.flac	and he has a way i think of working with us and and really pulling things out so i'm um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00031.flac	yeah well the the thing hat attract to meed to apersion is that they you know when i sat down and i talked to to and i talked to
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00032.flac	being more elevated and some of the movies the referenced that i watched for like rose marye's baby and pulterguysed and and films like that that we're just
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00033.flac	no blod and gor and hor and and that's kind of the same thing that we wanted to accomplish with aperitieon um is is
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00034.flac	it's it's not the typical or film and and we are doing everything that a normal person would do um you know rather than doing the cheep thrill scar or movie tactics and so um ye that was a
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00035.flac	uh you know really wanted celing to be
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00036.flac	stupend and they're noti mean just to peopl unt but they're they're not smore  they're not proactive and so that was um a big votabater for me as well and um you know from the getgo they have just been very collaborative with me and with sivasian who plays my love
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00037.flac	uh i have seen some of it in there um we were actually doing

id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00003.flac	um no not because ofbhout i think there's a difference in the sense that um we are a little more comfortable with ourselves and in our skin and with our characters um i think that may be part of the reason it is such success s because we have i mean we have great writing we all ofe our jobs we
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00004.flac	honestly we love what we do and we love our fans and uh i don't think any of us wanna
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00005.flac	uhone are just so moved that everyone else is as passionate about our characters as we are because we really do love what we're doing um and as an actor you want to amursomeone in this world that you've created and you want to afect them and so the fact that these girls are
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00006.flac	yealling and it's just it's it warmed your heart it's a really amazing thing
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00001.flac	um i enjoyed the wedding episode i enjoyed playing a robot and and the idea that she couldn't be photograped was histerical to me and when he said i do she should i do instead of him you know things like that were very funny i did not agree that they sould'ave
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00002.flac	that was something i didn't think should ever have happened because first of all at couldn't they werenat the same
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00003.flac	the script was good um i loved the show with the lion

id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00006.flac	but i did know you're supposed to let them become familiar with you and be friends and feed them a little meet uh i knew things like you don't stand too close to them you can scratch theour ears but we're ready to jump because they could break your leg not on purpose but they're big and so the first day the lion
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00007.flac	i went to lary and i said lary let's go over and make friends with the lion and he said make friends with the lion i said yeah we should go over and feed him a little meet and make friends i'm not gonna make friends with any bla cand be black black
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00008.flac	and i i made friends wof the lion fit him his meet scratched his ears and then we

id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00001.flac	no if they aske me for me or if i was sold to them for it but uh i was very happy that it did it was a wonderful experience it was based on the
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00002.flac	i was very happy that it did it was a wonderful experience it was based on the the song hearper bala
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00003.flac	where the moma went my moma went to the pt and told hem off they said her skirts a to short misis
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00004.flac	very had her own ideas about how things should be she was not very conservative at all uh she wasn't a bad woman but and she was a good
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00005.flac	because she wasn't like the other momiys she was uh prettier but she was all so kinda swiner you know she she liked to dance she liked to drink a beear once in a while and uh she went to church but uh when she walked in everybody
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00006.flac	i don't know who's idea it was to buy it as a television series nbc
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00007.flac	the people who owned the properity i have no idea oh i know as one day dhay called and said would you do i and thy said oh yeahoh it was
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00008.flac	more they they excagirated the characters more um the problem with the show was that no one could decide who was the bos on the show if the producer was or the director was and so the second year they they got a different producer and
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00009.flac	uh i had nothing to say about it i was very unhappy about it actually it was sure would
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00010.flac	nand they did a fabulous job i don't know who was unhappy with them but somebody was and um
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00011.flac	second year so thatit was constantly going ziging and zaging going in different directions and with different casts and different
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00012.flac	that isn't healthy for anyone i don't know it was everyone's idea of what comedy is you know they each
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00013.flac	um the problem with the show
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00001.flac	has to let her son grow up and doesn't want to wants to get him out of the army and so uh she doesn't join the army but she takes on someone elses
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00002.flac	and there you get the comedy of course it's really about bonding and and
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00003.flac	and uh she finds out uh he he writes her letter andtells her that instead of going to college he joined the army and of course his father uh died when he jumps out of an eiroplane in veat nom and the parashoot didn't open so the mother is understandably nervous about him going into the army
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00004.flac	men well that's the contract with a studio or a net work to do uh so many shows mine is a pilot and six shows
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00005.flac	a widow a working mother no she's not either she's devorsed it's right and has three children twelve

id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00007.flac	that we had sidny sheldin creating the show and we had a wonderful cast who uh who
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00008.flac	sit together um that's
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00009.flac	and andy tried to get me fired because he thought i was a a disructive influence in the barber shop and then he ended up
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00010.flac	i do i think it's it's wonderful the people that do it i i like to look at them i thinkthey're beautiful
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00011.flac	id love to you know the problem uh with uh being an actor
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00012.flac	that so often you you form really firm friendships with people and then don't see them for
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00013.flac	uh because uh as you know lary is doing a very popular series and and hopefully i will
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00014.flac	for a while i don't i don't know what it's doing now i haven't seen it no one's told me anything about it so i guess it's not on the
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00015.flac	well ut the the movie was on about two months ago
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00016.flac	i's a very natural actor yes he played a half bread half
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00001.flac	george con students  ended up my juniear summer at working at an investimant
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00002.flac	and i think what happened is i had this experience where i'vd been making short
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00003.flac	i had t experience where mian's al mic directed and other earth sall directord and of my
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00004.flac	under watter wit work like taking a car home at three in the morning showring
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00005.flac	relike we're gonna make this film here's the top ic we'e got forty thours let's do it and i was like okay so he write this little short and do this film and stay up for two days
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00006.flac	new exactly what kind of money i as to make what life it would be like and and it all felt i wasn't passionate about murders and accusitions i wasn't passionate
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00007.flac	and i saw that some of my hollys wor you know and i thought this i just don't belong
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00008.flac	and i'm gonna be a workholic no matter what i might as well be a workholic
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00009.flac	really that was really challenging but the place that i had arived at was that
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00010.flac	i love uh i love that and then i s always graduating from the  find
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00011.flac	and so then it just became a question of okahow can i act in how can i act in the way that i would like to do it you know how can i
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00012.flac	i i had do plays in things in high school but no
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00013.flac	met this wonderful man hary master george and i studied with him and he's amazing
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00014.flac	this what he told me the first day that i walked in the glass this kinda sound sort of like heddy and intelectual but itsnot really
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00015.flac	epic mackro part of the story first the more sot thesort of sience uction element and then we worked backwards the mhe idea was haow
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00016.flac	in the sort of like scyfypremise what human drama could we tell that
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00017.flac	talking to you or me talking to me like whatwolt that conversation be like we have that in our minds all day long tit's like iner personal dialog
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00018.flac	you know overnight becomes drastically different and how does she
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00019.flac	terrified by him in that memork and we loved the idea of casting i somebody with that kind of graviy tas and
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00020.flac	we um uh back in jorshe when we first met we were we dated and we went to kubit together and we made the
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00021.flac	his courage is is unbelievable you know it's it's really difficult to make your
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00022.flac	not traditional way you know to not have go into i it a lot of financey i mean it began with myce and i going to live at his mom's house with my sister and his friend
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00023.flac	e have a camera we have a laptop wt final cup we have this crazy story idea let's try to make a movie and
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00024.flac	s to do now which is that you don't have to wait for pormission anymore i mean before it's like i  came to ela
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00025.flac	can't really think of it yeah we were inspired by the innernet and the idea that at the time we were watching a lot of intreatment on our laptops
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00026.flac	lone in my bedroom with tae laptop watching the show that's about like unraveling this s
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00027.flac	at night and i think we thought from that like what about writing a story that within the dna of the story you're taking advantage of what the web experience can do what watching something on
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00028.flac	quit you've driven all the way there you've park shou've like gotten nd i mean it has to be a really bad movie for you to walk out like ye o  but with can you tellus
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00029.flac	you have to at any point they can just close their laup of and do something else you have to find
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00030.flac	loer them in it's a much more uh suductive
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00031.flac	and the idea of crafting aa story where that was in the dnnaa
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00032.flac	appeal to us bcus is is when obamo was happening and the the power of his campain over the internet the way the
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00033.flac	iincredible woman came up to me after the another earth screaening and this wis after the uanen
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00034.flac	she was uh she was crying and not in the way that you sometimes feel people cry at the theater which is i mean i do this i'm gilty
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00035.flac	the're really high concept that's sure he could't not we
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00036.flac	that imfltrates a cult that's meeting in the basement of this house in the sanfornando velie and when they go there they meet at the safehouse and they mead ju scrub down and put on hospital gdowns and theyir hands a're bownd and they're blindful they're put in a van
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00037.flac	some of my voice for instance is that i think it it works as bot it works as both in a theatrical so i
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00038.flac	with michr budget filmmaking hat question really becomes like watdo you do with the thee
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00039.flac	take the place of that down the road like i wonder what thing could agrogate story
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00001.flac	do art and he made a video art piece at the time of uh himself
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00002.flac	and i was inspired by it i think he was to a the time we were also listeing to a lot of doctor richard barins in's uh pulp physic sort of aer physic stuff on tape i think those two things came together and it kind
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00003.flac	the story was born and we just we wanted to tell story about a duplicate earth and thes sort of parolele reality and then we were like well what is a human drama
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00004.flac	where a conferntation with yourself would have the most emotional resonanc
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00005.flac	to retall the human dramas that we often see but from like a slightly
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00006.flac	lke a fresh sort of perspective and i think scifi also lets you talk about what's
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00007.flac	without being didactic and so that's i think sort of why we're both indo cifie
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00008.flac	that moment was tremendous i mean i can't even i don't think we ever thought that this story would reach such a wide
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00009.flac	move people that deeply like that response was overwhelming it was so visra
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00010.flac	to i think when you make a movie you know you don't make it in a vacum you make it because you want
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00011.flac	and so i think hopefully we smuggled a litt of bit across and that was
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00001.flac	comes up with stories he directs he shoots he edits and he loves to do all of those things and that's part of how he really works as an artist is this complete sort of
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00002.flac	um an actor and that's what i love to do and i
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00003.flac	that inspired me and i didn't and i was reading a lot of stuff for women where the women are always
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00004.flac	dao distress and and uh i didn't wanna do that i didn't i oidn't wanna i don't wanna be part of putting out visions of girls into the world that like i wouldn't have wanted to take in as a little girl and so i thought i would be cool to just righte better stuff for women and
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00005.flac	so we started learning to write trying to read screen writing books and trying to figure o had a tell an erative
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00006.flac	the kind of ideas that make you leave the theater with a sense of wonder like what is you know that sort of feeling and but we wanted to marry that with
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00007.flac	i don't know i i think we often went to the theater looking for those kinds of movies and didn't see them it's like films are either really spectical sort of high concept driven or there's you know small substantive dramas and you don't often see the two braite together and so we were trying to do that and it was the difficult thing to crack in the wrigting of it because on one hand you're dealing with these like huge lofty
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00008.flac	skuy and the discovery of dople gangers like what are people even like on the streets you know how are you dealing with that and then you'r tryng to balence all of that thinking with what ar
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00009.flac	you know genuan ways in which two people who have sort of suffered through tragity together heell one another s a lot of like maccro
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00010.flac	in the directing and in his vision of it because you could easily toppl over into making a film that just seems not
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00011.flac	and sort of silly and i think it for him it was really important in the way he shot it in the way he edded in all of the construction the colars everything for it to feel like a real story that this thing was happening to real people so much so that it has it would almost feel like what if you you know we're watching someone's home vidio and you just captured another planete in the sky and that that kind of realism would make you believe and um so
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00012.flac	it's it's great writing is amazing and i i've spent a lot of time trying to forgur how to do that and i think i will always do that but even when you'r writing with a collaborator things are coming from your sort of shared point of view and that point of viewis so
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00013.flac	who is like boren in america who's inter twenties who has had a certain sert of experiences you see the world a certain way and
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00014.flac	thing that's so intoxicating about being an actor is that you get to
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00015.flac	lose yourself in someone else's point of view their way of seeing things in a story that you never would have conseved of to become that person
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00016.flac	you know travel somewhere with someone that is the real thrill i think of being an actor so
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00017.flac	in taking something on that's new i like to be a little bit afraid like fearful that i might not that tis a challenge that i don't know that i'm we'll have to really stretch myself in a way to find this person to live in this person and if you're not doing that than i think you're playing it safe and if you're playing it safe tan tand i think you're not in you're never putting yourself out there to faile and i think you have to fail
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00018.flac	you have to fail and make a fool of yourself to grow at all as an artist youhave to be realling to willing to really make mistakes otherwise
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00019.flac	never wanna do that so when i read things i'm always looking for something that gives me that like tingle of rooflike
