id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00001.flac	very often i am and then sometimes i'm not and when i catch myself realizing that i have reverted back into beinero ma i
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00002.flac	to a family that would use that eventually wouned up using me as a a
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00004.flac	les so this black family who had two teen age children
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00005.flac	i don't i know people don't believe it when i say i don't know how old i am but i really i know somewhere i'm  waypest
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00006.flac	wes is  but a we pes fifty but i was u really still about five six
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00007.flac	she took tri and there were times when the whole family was gone into the felds or something like that harvesting picking cotten or whatever they were doing and we were left in the house alone the two teenagers would tyye me in what we call a crokar sack
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00008.flac	wast and then ty me to a tree and uh with a peach tree switch they would beat my botdm until i was bleading and i only had one thing to wear and that was also madeup of potato
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00009.flac	you start talking about it like we are talking about it now and you try to noth get emotional about it but all of a sudden those feelings do
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00010.flac	the idea of them tying me to a tree and you're not not able to
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00011.flac	strictmyad was u a very tall lady
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00012.flac	and also very fhair and complectioned she's hah jerky very magestic looking i was defnitely affraid of her
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00013.flac	nduty you know because she got a letter from the south that told her that if i was not taken away from this family that they would either starve me to death or beat me to deathr
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00014.flac	and therefore she decided that she would take me on into new york but she wasn't anybetter she
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00015.flac	becase i was trying to get away from her but where do you go what do you do i
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00016.flac	and whenever i had a few penies i could the nic tir was a subway was a nickle for
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00017.flac	do the they're hopping that the conductor wouldn't see me because they used to have
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00018.flac	hind everything you possibly could i could possibly find to hide behind because i never have been with that kind of security within erthana that makes me feel that she will ever be accepted i don't think er the in myself and my sub consious and when i'm writing the book when i was riting the book i
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00019.flac	the urchen that i really know i am inside of myself and not wearing any makeup and not caring about what i look like
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00020.flac	ducklen nobody wants you and she's trying so hard to find somebody thats as er mats alright you wanted to but nobody's done that yet maybe i
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00021.flac	never touched me it was a ason wells rubye rosa and there were
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00022.flac	real love strong love that men have had for me two of them john berry ryan the third and
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00023.flac	particularly with boys who come from extremely wealthy families and they are the only son
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00024.flac	everybody knows am past fifty whatever the number may be does not seem to matter to them
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00025.flac	no matter how hard you try not to it's still there i'm not a
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00026.flac	i'm very glad that she's still a part of me and i'm very glad that she will always be a part of me
id10270_5r0dWxy17C8_00027.flac	cause she helps me do what she knows i have to do out there on the stage because there is where my survival is with that public and with those who who know me well enough to
id10270_5sJomL_D0_g_00001.flac	ecceptid a part because something is in you that says you are that character and if you have a little bit of a difficult time finding it you will find it eventually it may take you
id10270_5sJomL_D0_g_00002.flac	in order to find the character but you will but that character to me was so
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00001.flac	beng as physically huge as he was and having to well at that time up
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00002.flac	tand to work with him was not always the most exciting thing in the world in the matter
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00003.flac	exciting but it was very scary and at the s at the same time it was very
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00004.flac	s four of the three of them and me would take me to lunch at the
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00005.flac	macain a feeld in south carolina and as a result you do what you are told to do not what you want to do
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00006.flac	and i think that i was affraid always to exercise my feelings about anything because i thought i
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00007.flac	know anything about taking care of children my mother had died or whomever was that was saying that she was my mother who had given me away to so many people at the time down south so she brought me up north my ant
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00008.flac	no it's not for me iam a catherin donam dancer and mis donam has sent me out to get this makeup
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00009.flac	instinctively using that animal instinct that i had when i was a child in the south because being given away you know you have to rely on whatevers
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00010.flac	anand life has been so much fun for me but to be able to do that to make fun
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00011.flac	t because i can tease myself i can play with my mind
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00012.flac	taking me as a something that is insulting them but cat woman to me was really one of the best things i've ever done
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00013.flac	and i don't think that when people are i cannot talk for other actors but when i am called on to do a
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00014.flac	because i'm a human being i'm an american sitizen i hapen to love this country and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00015.flac	came back to america and that's when we had this tremendous discussion all the time as a matter of fact the black panther
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00016.flac	n that they would get me again but i stood my ground and walked from the seventh avenue teresa hotel
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00017.flac	to all by myself back to the apolo seter and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00018.flac	and a no matter how many words they threwh at me i stood my grounds and no
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00019.flac	said why is there so much guvinal delenquency in e
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00020.flac	f different arias of the united states among the young people i still have an organization in whats called
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00021.flac	where we bring the young people in to teach them physical theropie o the danceform ecetera ecetarauh as well as other things but this luncion was with us fifty women who were to discus the problem
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00022.flac	when the time came i rose raised my hand and told miis jonson what the young boys of this country had told
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00023.flac	want us to be involved there it was a dishonorable war and it was an unwinnable war so when i raised my hand and told mies jonson what those boys had told
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00024.flac	sems that within two hours i was out of work in doanited states according to
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00025.flac	because i believe that if you get an education you can cross
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00026.flac	you have that freedom of freedom of speech freedom
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00027.flac	and as i said we in our country can solve our own problems on our own home
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00028.flac	and therefore what do we feel in our own country should be
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00029.flac	the ambasador hotel in los angeles and i called the
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00030.flac	uh go over the contract to see that everything was so and so and so and they said
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00031.flac	ecame to my house in beverly hills and asked me if i would do salim lalon
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00032.flac	thenumber five character she's not number one two three or foure but i never worried about whether you are the
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00033.flac	we live in a free democratic world and unless we are exercising those freedoms
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00034.flac	this is what this country is all about speak out and do one to others as you would have them
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00035.flac	for the world and that's one of the reasons why i wrote this book now that's outcal rejuvinated it's never too late because those of us who have come
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00036.flac	to us and the value of that life and if we didn't do that wewere absolutely out of our minds and
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00037.flac	you can break through all bariors once you've had that education but go for what you're really
id10270_8jEAjG6SegY_00038.flac	if you go for what you really love and what you really want to do you'll do a better job at it and money will always come and make you comfortable
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00001.flac	what is now becoming more focused into the realization of the black people that they two must become and behave and exercise their integral part of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00002.flac	i think that somebody who should be running this country should be somebody who knows how to be a business person who realizes that a business should be
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00003.flac	is always at a deficit and the people of the country are constantly being forced into paying off the dets of politicians whom we've
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00004.flac	and it's about time that we realize that like it says
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00005.flac	stand the chance of the possibility of becoming president of the united
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00006.flac	to be in that position they have to know about how to take care of business they have to know how to
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00007.flac	not the blacks or the italians and whatever why an't y we con turned about america i thought hres
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00008.flac	i don't want any favors as a a person of collor i'm sure that the japanese or the i don't know about the japanese they seeme toto be whanta hangg every
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00009.flac	so interesting to me that every time i leave this country and i come back i find that i feel more like a forener in my own country than i did from the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00010.flac	taking over very sutelly they like the man said you won't have the need guns to take over america we will just walk in and this
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00011.flac	yes everywhere and i keep my eyes open all the time and you talk to people of the countries whom you can get
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00012.flac	um nowlege from not from politicians you're not gonna get anything from politicians because they're very cool and called diplomatic but the people the real people that's why i take my chances i'm going to foren countries and talking to the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00013.flac	then they will i'm more ap to tell you the truth but why aren't they giving away this land everything has so semingly is dealing with what the bible says the religion says this piece of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00014.flac	to us and there is an always a bottom line of religious isum that says we have the right to this land god
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00015.flac	merica so would would u could i go to the government and say i want my landback
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00016.flac	the plasa hotel when i was singing one night and theye were like twenty seets empty directly in front of me and they came in all of its a because they were saving
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00017.flac	aga kings ugacan's family and i stoped the show and waited until each one of them sat down and they had all of this jels on because et was one of those people not the the uga but one of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00018.flac	members of his family i won't mention the name he had he would hiere models and then he would go to wintons ocat and tipin
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00019.flac	and so i waited until he all they were all seated there in cam down then they had their little coffe
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00020.flac	that and then i said to him in turkish dach ar go to ther room and he started to he looked at me and at the end of the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00021.flac	i don't really think i'm looking for anything special except maybe a good babner because i'm a durt person i
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00022.flac	i know that if i have a piece of land i will never go hungry because i know very much i'le to be a
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00023.flac	if someone gave it to me but its more than a apt wi'll be uh hark
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00024.flac	l that sort of thing but when i came out of the south into new york being brought there by my ant who took me out of
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00025.flac	after my mother gave me to this family who was not very nice to me because i'm not the right color to be accepted by the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00026.flac	to be accepted by the whites and youare on top of all of that is a bastard child ou
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00027.flac	no buthe wants you but if you're given away then that family or whoever you're given away to uses you as a work mul and of course if there was food i got it if e there was no food then i was the last one to be fed so between the animals the cats and the dogs and myself
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00028.flac	able so i'd learned how to survive from the forest and from the dirt my ant brought me from
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00029.flac	the garbage cans and sleeping on the subways until i' found e way into the catherin donam company by having an auditi
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00030.flac	and when i asked him what is the character about what kind of person i am how old a woman is she and he said you are all women you represent all women of all
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00031.flac	and that's why i chose you to do this part because you're the most exciting creature ihave ever
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00032.flac	years i began to understand what he ment because
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00033.flac	from my side that he felt about me and to me an exciting person isu knowing one of the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00034.flac	things about an exciting person to me is knowing when to say something and when not to say something and if you have something to say and you don't know how to say it then the best thing to do is be quiet and
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00035.flac	n though they said it was very exciting from the artist story in
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00036.flac	pek mex gorden after i was a flop at lavanros mexk gorden who oned the blu angel called and
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00037.flac	six weeks or two months later because i was in new york i had no way of getting back to parise nobody even the william moris agentcy didn't remember my name they didn't know who madelava was but they were the ones who brought me to america o li the oneros and mak
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00038.flac	she was in it but it was joon carrluh ronnygram and myself because we set around fors o
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00039.flac	so forth and so on and i was the best dresse pauper in paris because o people like jack firth perbilma balencia
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00040.flac	liked my body and they liked me as a personality so they would call me and they would give me the clothes that they thought were
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00041.flac	he should still have a kind of show like that we should still have a kind of show like jack pa and we
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00042.flac	isbecause they're intelligent people what happened to these intelligent writers who have you know because a show like jeck par is not
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00043.flac	today i think he will always be  able to make a good um providing so he's a the bi i
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00044.flac	life is different everyday the words may be the same but there is a lot of inuindos too a lot of adlib the
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00045.flac	and last night it was uh michell from um star trek
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00046.flac	girl and carlranna's wife was there last night and it's
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00047.flac	knowing that i don't like to know before because i get too nervous i'm ows it's wonderful  exciting that my goodness that person came to see me in all that you know but it's
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00048.flac	o life hes to love and here's to you because after all is said and done
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00049.flac	because i know now what i'm  ih i have achieved than i know more of where i want to go and i am now very sensitive to my own
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00050.flac	who um acountents maybe who were theves ecetera excetera and that's why i'm saying to you skip i bought thank goodness i bought real estate because at that i know how to survive on but you never know it
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00051.flac	from one moment to the other it depends on what you do with your life which becomes the most valuable thing and what you've done with your life for me i feel there's always another tomarro
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00052.flac	well i'm ot saying yes or no i don't know what happens tomorro but i i don't have any man in my life
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00053.flac	e wanted the mothers became the most daminering situation that cut off the relationships and the ones that i thought
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00054.flac	of him and his people to advise him to do that because i think it's about time also that two different
id10270_GWXujl-xAVM_00055.flac	cultures too many races too many groups too many thisis too many thats
id10270_OXdd7Gmluts_00001.flac	leaving the company i didn't have enough hootsper on my own to do that at the time but when mis donam forced me to by saying i dear
id10270_OXdd7Gmluts_00003.flac	is from that child of uh the south carolina when nobody
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00001.flac	n getting to a point in their lives where they are just about able to start paying back their parents for whatever theyir
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00002.flac	of the regection that she had when she was a child and now that she
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00003.flac	it's good for me to be a sterio type and that's what i am that fa
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00004.flac	ngr thirteen fourteen years old i wannta be evil
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00005.flac	is with the man whereby i wanna be equl is playing with a child so to speak wor the child
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00006.flac	thecameris gan to fall back and it's true the ceberis had to close up because
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00007.flac	they couldn't find people as paul soneban who oned tae plasa hotel once ind i
id10270_OhfKF8FSq3Y_00008.flac	every step of the way and i do realize it dn't have to make myself to that but every step
id10270_OmSWVqpb-N0_00001.flac	ofit i think that when i started to sing songs like that it was our s who pushed those
id10270_PXmaB6Ui0fE_00001.flac	the mecanisms behind the discos because we do not
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00001.flac	and i came across the letter that jack andison wrote me it said these are your files that we found
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00002.flac	ically requested by lady buird and president jonson
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00003.flac	in the united states so that uhi would be not sceene and therefore i'm
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00004.flac	my opinions about the problems among the young people of america at that time that was the question of the luncion and fifty of us ladies who work in the different communities across america and me and saw also in
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00005.flac	dn i'm working with these people all the time and therefore i know what their feelings are and when they ask tha question about
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00006.flac	ok my getting a good credit for putting flowers alongrount sixty six
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00007.flac	place that i can remember et did not have a return engagement and when i was not asked
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00008.flac	and maybe my popularity is waining and sof that does happen and i started to begin to
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00009.flac	called me in nineteen seventy four january and said this is what we found
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00010.flac	anywhere and tha therefore you're that's why you're having a hard time
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00011.flac	or they were claiming that they were communists or something like this and when they couldn't find anything on
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00012.flac	and make you a very unpopular name in the ey of the public and in the minds of the public and
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00013.flac	tha they're still doing and if they wan na get rid of you they'll find a way to get rid of you and the best way to do it is to
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00014.flac	worked with just bst they did with the anti american commity i was shocked when i came back to america in ni
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00015.flac	this kind of thing is happening to us we fought a war against things like this with the
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00016.flac	something i still can't believe it and you never know if it is still going on because my side of the story was never really told what was i going to do
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00017.flac	wanted me to do that and i said i think they should appologize to the american people because they know we should not be involved in that war and
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00018.flac	and i don't understand how someone like this the man who had the faith of the young boys of this country in the pam of his
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00019.flac	but morally whatever it is we'd not suppose that we shouldn't be the
id10270_x6uYqmx31kE_00020.flac	had lost this job which i lost my job i still did it i didn't know i was gong to lose my
id10270_zjwijMp0Qyw_00001.flac	i'm an american citisan i happen to love this country and i know that we have our struggles
id10270_zjwijMp0Qyw_00002.flac	ans because being as physically huge as he was to work with him was not always the most exciting thing in the world in the matter
id10270_zjwijMp0Qyw_00003.flac	because i believe that if you get an education you can
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00001.flac	well i mean uh i'm uh we were on the break right now i uh we finished uh in march and i went in
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00002.flac	an english uh movie an english film called uh shalla go which is like a romantic comedy kind of
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00003.flac	um so that was a lot of fun it was a go it was a ah good change and um
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00004.flac	back to shoot the fourth season in july in and we're doing a couple days in paris which i'm uh very excited about love paris so uh
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00005.flac	hetook care of me kept me out of trouble that he's that he's wonderful
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00006.flac	how many people can say thy've done that so uh so that was that was that was fantastic and um i was really pleased with the way they we broughteverything together i think it was probably the best finala we've had of um of the three seasons so um so yeah i'm i
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00007.flac	i mean i don't know i mean  i really don't know what's what's going on because we haven't had the script yet i mean maybe
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00008.flac	m are they ment to be together are they not you know they bad for each other cause it looks like
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00009.flac	it's fighting fire with fire isn't it i don't know they i have great fun workin e lating as i said so it
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00010.flac	great partnerships you know the crimefighting duo or something like that or
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00011.flac	th like bonney and clide a littl of it mabe tu um so they they you know they bounce off one another they um i think
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00012.flac	well i mean he was going a propose yeah in the third season you know that was his uh his big step but maybe it was a god thing
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00013.flac	e saw um he had very little consideration ord respect for uh for others and enjoyed playing games with people  manipulation but then um that kind of involved it wl
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00014.flac	have one and fall in love with um with blair and hand this relationship but of course his other um i's other sides to his pers personality kind of um
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00015.flac	some self distruction or distruction of the uh of their bond of their relationship so
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00016.flac	um so we we've seen him we've seen him progress we've seen him grow i think he's i think he's learned a
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00017.flac	i think it's um i think it's a mixed thing really i mean i you know i
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00018.flac	it's it's a progression of somebody's life almost you know it's which people change wo go through diferen
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00019.flac	and then um josh and stefeney who came off the uh the oc they brought everything they brought their built in fan base
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00020.flac	ractive i think they're entertainment value so i mean i think all of these things
id10271_1gtz-CUIygI_00021.flac	the final season you thin oh i don't know man i mean i mean we've got this
id10271_37nktPRUJ58_00001.flac	its brandy sam song smartpone to um to take out and about with me while i'm here  doing this kind of like
id10271_37nktPRUJ58_00002.flac	hitand uh hit the people back i mean it' et's been pretty extravagant season you know i mean it will kind of ended up
id10271_37nktPRUJ58_00003.flac	a lots of um mis behavior with regards to um his relationship
id10271_8gcdEYAKNkE_00001.flac	the gossip gothing everywhere because it means the show's getting the attention it deserves you know people have
id10271_EOQXxK1whgU_00001.flac	anhe i was in the vergil mobar stor in sidny last night and uh we did a yuah we did a signing and um i got

id10271_EOQXxK1whgU_00003.flac	of uh playing somebody younger than myself you know we actually have to like shave every day which can be very iritating
id10271_LjLjQkfhd2o_00001.flac	a nice charming script definitely and um charming nice character to play um and then

id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00002.flac	yeah my character's a bit of the uh bit of the bad boy um but you know i mean there there's a bunch of elements to it that kind of made it attractive to
id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00003.flac	very uh very bad relationship with his father so he's running through al thouh

id10271_PfcJLmkhGbk_00007.flac	bision would be to um keep being uh involved in exciting projects you know and work with people who are at the top of their

id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00001.flac	to come through parents and stuff um he he had that and u some nurture in that he just pushed it and made it work we when i was at uh standup workshop learning to do standup because i only did skhetches o he was down there were different types of stand ups you could be you could choose one and one was the sort of godlike geniuse and that wasthe robin williams you can head to that but only if you're crazy you head
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00002.flac	he could have done it more because i think hoh happens in america if you if you get successful in comedy you will go into a television series or a film series and that becomes kee and it's a difit' it's a different thing to stand up so ii i feel he did occasional uh standup tours after taking off into such a uh such a huge way but not not all the time it was he was so wonderful at it i i don't actuallywt know why he didn't come back to a
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00003.flac	that was that was juss robin he was he was a nice guy i when i first met him on a film
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00004.flac	i he was just very welcoming and and i pushed i said com i can you watch my video and he watched it immediately which was which was very od you would expect a a lot of pull back on that but he was just
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00005.flac	a decent person and for a lot of us
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00006.flac	clenical and some people havent and some people down and it just it's a disease and its
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00007.flac	all of us commedians do but he he was making himself loff i' pretty sure he was performing he was the first person in his audience um when i did this film
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00008.flac	would have done he wouldh've just gone off and they said the script would h've been here and he wouldh've gone off in seven ways to
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00009.flac	can't actually try and be someone you can't say i want to be that because you can you can ad little bits on to your own style but my styl was more sort of woodiy allan with um billiy connely and and richard prier mixed in but it's just that he did hit this godlike genius place of being able to do anything and it was political and it was fast and it was impressions and he would run through
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00010.flac	don't usually move of the stage um he just had this ability to take a room and uh
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00011.flac	he's just he's just right up there i mean it's um um you know uhs there should never be number one's in creative things but he's in the top ten of all time um and o maybe the top five it's just
id10273_0LbtndiXJC0_00012.flac	it is rather tragic i didn't want to come in here and do this but i thought i was discussing this with steve coogen whether i should do it because it looks sometimes it ws likeveryone jumps on telly and talks about people but i just wanted to say
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00001.flac	i anounced five years ago that i'd run in may twenty twenty so that's kind of weird cause you normaly
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00002.flac	iwill be the fourth when i get that and then russhian well i just i just i'm kind of ambitious i i'm positive on people i want me to do well i want everyone to do well i hate the right wing i hate uh religious extr
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00003.flac	if you're cabinete minister that is a a high position of power but it's more of a cheear leader for london you're in charge of transport and police but once you've chosen
id10273_0OCW1HUxZyg_00004.flac	n well he is sent to writ so i'm okay with that but he's not my party uh it's more about the few than the many um and he said he wouldn't take a part if the national helh service and he sort of did and so i'm for
id10273_3i_6peYQarY_00001.flac	pitso italian and if you say the big t if is three cillables or more if you just say it with a different accent it is probably thesame word transportation

id10273_5TWpQYtboq0_00012.flac	show that he keeps doing uh his talk show for some time uh the
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00001.flac	o actually well when it comes to genatalia uh for getting down of that what's
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00002.flac	eto the audience there's this thing of dumming down that they talk about in television going for the lowest coman denominator i tendto goo for the highest common denominator and i assumehe inteligence of the audience and if i played a an audience that wasn't sharp  they would probably linch me cause they would say wa talking about but i assume people hove wach the whole bunch of films they can get references to history politics obscure things cause i tend to
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00003.flac	i don't know enormous bu i do take in a lot of facts but i tend to just throw out small facts that i've learned which makes
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00004.flac	and the changes in technology equls the future this is my sort of theary so if you study the past you get the future and you can work at wh
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00005.flac	tacking and i'm very positive about the union so um i think it's the way that if humans aren't
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00006.flac	people say that actually people say you you won't remember much of that to i remember that and everything before that
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00007.flac	lemonade and biskets and some other kids were there and other parents wer thert so it was quite weard it w's like a
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00008.flac	i think if if your alternative sex reality gay lesbian transgender you
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00009.flac	not wildly emotional you know not great at sensing stars and designes my senses
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00010.flac	women ten am gay men i think have their senses more hightened men have them lowered but maybe slihtly more
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00011.flac	just i have two sort of modes i just go garly mye
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00012.flac	and u i've you know there's no shame there's no there's guilt in shame orh the two adjectives you get free with
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00014.flac	not the case even though it obviously makes an extra bit of something that goes with it but
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00015.flac	you know it's oh you're gay you're lesbian a lot of them just gust keep it
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00016.flac	so it u it it wasn't the thing that made it happen it's just
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00017.flac	well yeah i've always wanted to have booves but you know i looke kinda bloky so
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00018.flac	as lots of you know it's basicl lot of teenhich girls that wor girls like oh i  wanna have boos and i was thinking
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00019.flac	and the they they said you can you go to university and we pay you a wage
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00020.flac	and then you you give three years to the armey after that so i i seriously consider that because ii'm i'm quite military in myhed
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00021.flac	i a'm very stratigic if you think of you know some people's careers go great and they goes of and they go he and then when their career stops they don't know how it
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00022.flac	get all this rationalized which could be in the constitutin i don'tkn i don't know what's i've dan loded the constitution but i havn't rea it's also boring so politics is incredibly tedious that's why most people whade
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00023.flac	tedious as hell and my i'vea very um i'm a popcone eating film watcher so i find politics fascinating interesting i know it but it's
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00024.flac	uh the fun way to make politics exciting is to have a war well but it was very good it was great films came out of that fifty million people dead and we decided was his best not to do this anymore
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00025.flac	bit of a bang to over many many centuries you know and we kept doing this over
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00026.flac	i mean i think you kneed to have a sort of supreem counsel in europ where you have all the heads of all the countries
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00027.flac	what a wast of space i mean she as very tough and firm she's very you know hit the light i feel so she's kindof you know picked up a few things from adoff there
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00028.flac	tro isn't she she's got no imagination o coaurse you can get the mogety people speaking different languages
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00029.flac	hand maybe she's just she wasn't a lazy person i couldn't say that but lack ofa
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00030.flac	and i feelt since nineteen forty five any tatos in the world is like an abomination what are these people doing here
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00032.flac	doing it this should have been stoped we need to have the international criminal cort we need to have that with teeath all dictators should immediately go and have life inprisonment you don't even need to try them if you think about it because you don't need to prove that they're dictators they're already theyre dictators so
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00033.flac	on the ground so we can do anything we want out the i don't feel that it came from that
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00034.flac	everything kond a bit weird terrorism has started to happen you know the ocel home of bomming which everyone was quite
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00035.flac	in general forms yes you've gotta seporate religion and state um
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00036.flac	using terism with with ihnd would have less uh culture to grow
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00037.flac	uh there's there's obvously a number of things from religon and maybe the bulliys religion is the one to look at because it has no
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00038.flac	its it's it's when you get the magic thing  there's obviously something tat ting spiritual seems good openminded
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00039.flac	um my life is a bit messy but i'm i'm i actually i live in here
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00040.flac	see a play after that and i don' one play before that and that was
id10273_8cfyJEV7hP8_00041.flac	and but you really like the idea of people g that's great so much that you'
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00002.flac	you know acts of uh force of nature i think i think that's what we all do need to beed to get through this life to make the positive things happen in the world so uh that is the idea
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00003.flac	ny that holds bak the shownifre ye which is also down lodable from the webside the the um it's the prievious show it's stript
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00004.flac	uh they in in paris they can go oh yes grils eui uh u veconfus or veon bango you know he they can go oh yeah that's stupid in fact in france they don't have much absurdest humor as they go or sirial humor they and i said but monty pythen sai oh yes we like monty python not all of them dig it but you know te he the cool people di monty pithem but um
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00005.flac	cooler people the peoples certain amount of education they can dig so real humor and it's just the references so there's no the i my theary is there is no friench sense of humr there is no german sense of humor andi
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00006.flac	i just think there is mainstream an alternative sense of humors in every country so you might say benney hills i'm like a mainstream british sense of humor but he made all his references you know people' slapping on heads naked people running around and people could understand that in quite a lot of countries so there you go and then there's the more pithon is the example of more aulternative humor so you just make your
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00007.flac	tolwell you see i don't think any language is that difficult cause all russians speak russhian old manderan chinese kids speak mander an
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00008.flac	so you if some language wis really hard there should h've been he should be people saying okay here in russhia these kids just don't speak it they just point at things now i
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00009.flac	that time i think it's na i could be wrong when i get to rusha cause i haven't actually i' lade in i've learnt the alfhibet i'v learnt the alfhibete um and dillan marin has too and both me and dill and marran want to do uh russia in russian but i've got i'm go don doing german next year i'm already touring france in friench german next year in jerman in berlin two months there then i gonna do spaine for spanish and then russian and then i'll be able to report back more accurately but i think it's the syrilic alfhabet thet makes us go who i
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00010.flac	i don't even know where to begin on that one um but you just have to get to be on the alfhabet and
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00011.flac	u i can't prove this but i think it should be it's it's definitely durable it's just the amount of time at you need to put into it but it's a good thing to do in this
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00012.flac	cause you know we're in a financial cricis around the world and whatever and it's sort of bubbling around at the moment but then the world tends to go off and becomes slightly more right wing and hate other people and zenephobia turns into like racism and all this kind of stuff and i'm saying no let's go the other way i
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00013.flac	it was all liveate was going on and uh bob gull wofh a lot of people ware down in london and i felt i there was a
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00014.flac	so i felt i should go up and help there and um so i just got myself there and and started trying to help work with activists there
id10273_8fKRoUIpAJY_00015.flac	i i think i they said we'l we'll be in the concert at at at liv a murryfield and
id10273_9PmuAcGCSjY_00001.flac	migrant family i think it's beautiful that britain can do that you can go from they'r them coming in from escaping from the nacees to the to their sons both being politicions one running for uh being
id10273_9PmuAcGCSjY_00002.flac	ot kno i was going around as someone wh's going into politics in eight years um i was going
id10273_9PmuAcGCSjY_00003.flac	focus you know it's a five year parlement it could well be so all the focus keeps going towards the siting government so he doesn't get so much action in front of cameras this is te
id10273_DE9lM-s8LcA_00001.flac	uh i i know nathon quite well and um i haven't seen everything he's done so it's just great i just happene to be in town for comicon at the weekend and this was here so i said well yes i'll come it's great so you know great cast nathan lane
id10273_DE9lM-s8LcA_00002.flac	nto film studios but i do i when i'm doing theater i love doing it but um uh filming is my first
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00001.flac	they were and oh my gods they a my comedy s i think i'v i think i've stollen everything

id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00003.flac	everything is going basare i i just i don't think anyone in britain could believe that someone could hack a phone uh of someone who wasu they they you know w
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00004.flac	will be going why wasn't i hacked but no i'm quite happy not to be hacke unless i was hackt nd then i'm not happy to be hackh
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00005.flac	show and there's one or two tickets left if you want to just be sitting in a nice place cause i think at the back caus people are reluctant
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00006.flac	i'm just doing it i'm doing t on my own so uh no orchestra the orchestra has been uh told just just hang around guys and there's all these guys with violins
id10273_E50E5hbggyM_00007.flac	the gig tomorow you'rl find as you walk up and and bu things and stuff there's gonna be a lot of violence it' just kicking their heelsor
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00001.flac	it says it's just us nine and we have a big table and uh but so they came down we'd say well bo
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00002.flac	uh that's what goes on there but i'm very positive on europ it's what humanity does we gradually come together we gradually get feiror ruls for everyone so
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00003.flac	in rusian and and do more in russian i i really want to have russian
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00004.flac	uh homosexuality laws in the mid eighties in a demoa country that's suposed tohave had democrascy f or you know
id10273_Ed918auNI0Y_00005.flac	whatever weer supposed to have it in the uka and so you know countries can go backwards

id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00002.flac	tso if you're  of anethic minority you can actually rail against generally the
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00003.flac	people with money all these kind of things if you're working class against uh the the upper classes but if you're straight and and and white and male middle class it's just useless so thank god i'm a
id10273_GRB1GXRafiY_00004.flac	to journalists back in brittain uh than i was a transvestat and now and now i don't ware a dressand then people and i have

id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00001.flac	in e open air for tat because there's so many other things that people can do in a theater people ae
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00002.flac	oe script someone's gonna time it and that was the beginning of me developing my voice and my for my own character
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00003.flac	characters i always played characters with voices like this well small lidiats ho said i don't know i don't really want to be there so i always playing these voices like monty pithan and then i started developing my voice
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00004.flac	that took me undo standut that's the front part of my standup all the back part is me doing skhetches i set up a scene with myself with i
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00005.flac	that's it and it locked in has never moved and that was drama
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00006.flac	and then i couldn't get dramatic roles going and i made someone laugh when i was twelve in a
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00007.flac	and then i discovered pithan and the gones and spike milligan peter sellas and i thought okay i will i will not do drama because i became a spotty teenager most teenages go ingto this spotty
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00008.flac	god if there is a god says no you'll have the worst looks that ever happened and uh so i thought i can't do i can't be a hero romantic hero and this with this going on and greacy hair and pimpling
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00009.flac	um never see her again and then you go to a bording school and you don't see dad for two thiurds of the year so it was very
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00010.flac	difficult to survive i just closed down emotionally really stop crying when i got to about eleven i realized crying it was bad cause you lose arguments that way so i stop
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00011.flac	and so they decided well keep doing the job kids ar
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00012.flac	that's an option so he he used to go to sleep with the radio one just to have voices happening in the
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00013.flac	since then which is not standard practice otherwise everyone from bording schools would go and do all this stuff or i'm not sure i've i've got a determination genetic i think going on i've got a blody mind  nhis thing i can take quite a lot of grieef cobing my way and push back on it i came out thirty years ago being
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00014.flac	and uh it was not cool in eighty five to say you word trans lit or ninety or ninety five or two thousand or two thousand and five uh or two thousand and ten two thousand and fifteen its get
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00015.flac	was hugely tricky because i told everyone  in eghty five that i was tv transa whatever trans now i think we're called um and then i told my dad six years later it was just don't tell dad thing and i thought now i've gotta tell dad and he was cool about it and then i told him on a saterday and on a monday i did this first
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00016.flac	uh i made one joke about being transvesti and then i thought i got ta turn up in adress and that was a few months later and i thought my career
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00017.flac	get off the ground or or longer if you go back into the teenaches and uh i just thought this could kill it right here so it was it was
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00018.flac	true it's right it's what humanity needs to do we need to feel the feear and do it anyway you ned to push back against the extremist and the hapeful
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00019.flac	try and stamp on you who have murdered transgenda people and lesbian people and gay people for thousands of years since the dauwn of time you've gotta push back against these disgusting people and say that we are not disusting cause they've ben saying we're this gusti ewa saying actually this is genetics it's in there they'll find the coade at some point and i'm just as u a human being i have certain rights just to exist and the guilt and shame i'm not having that and
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00020.flac	t and they said well that's in it's infancy still because there's so many millions and millions of pieces that they still haven't quite
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00021.flac	different research hapening around the world but at some point i predict here and now on your program they will find they'le really gay they w'll be a lesbiand they' wll be transgende one and they won't be quite they woln't be quite so boxed in they will
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00022.flac	aand there's there's people who weare attracted to um so sexuality 's got i's got a few layers in there and it's quite a complex beast but i do predict it's genetic cause i never chose this and i'm so
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00023.flac	i still have gotl that side to me but there's also the guirly side and i've just been honest and told
id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00024.flac	well like if i looked for it i could find it anywhere any time probably yeah there was a a young woman in briysban who said are you wearing lipstic i said yeah and said you're sick and then she walked off and then my makeup adis who hapened toave been judo champion of of urop at fifteen she went off afterhe to and i she was

id10273_eLl_yTeuaKo_00026.flac	yes but i also u you know i wanted to do all the things i've done if i had a kid and you tryn to drag him around the world or you leve him in a bording school or what do you do that gets quite confusing and it's also uh relationships they'r
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00001.flac	ish uh itit it was wi cause i i id started taking off uh with out ih'd aleady told my friends i was trandsversed up but i hadn't told the

id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00004.flac	n the ke ston cops but what i say now is that in the sixties and seventies people payed money to buy heart and soul from the beatles the stones oll those bands then
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00005.flac	um no i i'm not in the line to be james bond um
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00006.flac	you know i i actually want to do action movies but they won't let me so i run forty three marrathens and i'll do my own

id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00008.flac	uwhen i did two in two days i did think actually i could stop now and i could dine out forever yeah it's
id10273_gHPh9j7lc58_00009.flac	it was sureal uh and no one would believe me i i was i was running all around the uk from capital of england the capital of wales to the capital of northline to capitale of scotland back and uh no people just wouldn't believe that it
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00001.flac	if you go int shops you won't see that one up from because they think that's too risa i think i think it's
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00002.flac	um but uh they song with it you know that coolwith ithey never people
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00003.flac	have a visual sense of humor in brutin they say have a visual sense of humor the germans have no sense of humor and they say all of america has no sense of irony
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00004.flac	mother died actually um cause i i did a play i played a raven my mom made the raven costume before she died ike she died when i was six and i remember not being that bothered about this sort of performing thing
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00005.flac	then i went to a bording schol and didn't see my dad a lot of the time and then audiences were like a surogat affection machine so i think that's when this lust for the love of an audience came and
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00006.flac	fo you know a hour and half two hours it's quite sureal it's u i i watch a lot of tell i don't read a lot of books but i i said know a lot of facts which i sort of weve in betwee i do a lot of stuff on history based things and  talk about the roman
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00007.flac	but in had stuff where moses and and jesus came back and then at the back of the sant pats cathederal you know and and stuff like that but it isn't heavily used and i suddenly thought i should go ing there cuse i love this subject anyway cause i think the future's
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00008.flac	amd watching the squer part and for four years and then i got nto stand up realizing i had to let in stand of it it became the busy comedy of britain
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00009.flac	i started talking about it but not wearing any makeup or anything and they said well he said  o transvesst i o is i
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00010.flac	sometimes not um and then they said alright he is a transpesse evbry he looks a mase looks like a small
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00011.flac	for easer notification transvesster transect ar tansectual is just someonewho's had more as s having an oibraction
id10273_hW0Q6eHqN-U_00012.flac	andes gone further down the line and there's there should be gay by sexual and lesbian transversed i
id10273_jyOctu82nhs_00001.flac	deliver because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny an the bottom line of acting as to be
id10273_jyOctu82nhs_00002.flac	and and  i i don't think it's gon i was wondering is is it gonna go away is it a fad that's that's come ing now and it's gonna go away
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00001.flac	um i was pushing at school seventeen eighteen i wrote a really ravishi play at sixteen but i was desperately trying t get thes stuff and then i
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00002.flac	good stuff at school seventeen and made a lot of people laugh wand i was about seventeen eighteen i did something that was quite dramatic but that couldn't help me at that
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00003.flac	cause i scared tof flying so i lernt te fly and i found that to put the plaine back down on the ground you need a confidence bordering arrogance to say this piece of
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00004.flac	singing to myself in a cold rubihy day but i was quite confident at this point putting out the tecoss thes animal tee
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00005.flac	which um i liked the irony of hand someone came in
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00006.flac	so i can choose to ed in things so i i try and get you try and get as much control as you can
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00007.flac	but you know still the majority of people a are sensible but people
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00008.flac	immegrants get deamanized and they say that everyone's trying to
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00009.flac	yt i came from a lot of falor so i just try to run marrithens in south africa and fail wit that but i go
id10273_oBaIbyCrTVw_00010.flac	that that it's this story of my life keep going back and back and back nd back and uh that's nelson mandei get off nelson
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00004.flac	in the obaand the am people go i don't know what that is ifi was in an underground
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00005.flac	s aday she's a berlin ting okay so it's the references that
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00007.flac	in the countryside where people as you know from you horrible time in the thirties a lot of support came for extrem views from out in the countryside people don't see much and they said well i don't like these people
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00008.flac	all these people cause they never come there they never see them so out in the countrysides that does not change the world majer towns and
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00009.flac	jerman you know you'll speak jerman he won't speak any italian we know this it's all genetics the the extremist the extremist papers the extremist
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00010.flac	now we're all humans and uh i'm just a transessti guy who's here talking rubish and it's intelligent rubish
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00011.flac	was a king during the three hundred years from william the concore to henry the fifth when in england we had
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00012.flac	the you know the the the religious language and every one was writing it down and saying how it should be spelt anglo saxon english was
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00013.flac	it's not the young i played moscho i played sant petersberg that's not that's not necessarily what russhia thinks but it's what people ar encouraged people
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00014.flac	in russia that happened in jermany in the thirties germany got over that uh we had it from sthature
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00015.flac	um it's th we'l we move fortif you draw a graf from ancient greace ancient
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00016.flac	and uh we get there so it's it's it's okay i mean stuff happens stuff goes backwards and
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00017.flac	has modest stillness and humility but when the winds of war blow in
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00018.flac	few uh political commedians have gone into paltics they prefere the freedom of being
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00019.flac	but humor does help in this because it makes things more light and and you can put forward your positive points and then i suppose you take
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00020.flac	uhand i believe there are some bad ones and you've had some bad ones and we've had some crappry ones and now we have som
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00021.flac	uh if there is a god fire just come down explain wirlbard to
id10273_prqT1CcDqMc_00022.flac	then they say well what about the mouslem g and then everyone's gonna get so angry and il said well that's their goy i'm

id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00004.flac	um you know it's it's obviously very boring it's it's quite contensious people dis agree with it norway isn't it
id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00005.flac	killing each otheryou know there was that the fight down in the bulkans and and that was hellish and that was a hellish war but we seemed to be

id10273_xN2fSTQHHkw_00007.flac	place on it but and i've noticed in scandinavia that you do lots of very dark dramas that now the whole world is getting to know where lots of people are dying in those dramas but not in

id10274_7rkVfW2yw0c_00003.flac	media but one of the reasons i'm not on is because i look at it enough already so um yeah i do
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00001.flac	on a classic rock story i um when i was fourteen years old i went for

id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00006.flac	edical problems that could happen but probably won't right now we're doing a show called it's the pits
id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00007.flac	couldn't happen it wouldn't happen but it's fun to watch it maybe happen

id10274_89UnsytX6Y8_00009.flac	you know you wan a classic rock story i um when i was fourteen years old i went for

id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00009.flac	one uh i found out about someone told me about this sai i heard they're doing another american pot and again i was like i think i'd
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00010.flac	dan i was like fo it's not happening and then i gotta call a day later that it was really happening and the way they got that together was they wrote a great script
id10274_L9q6XabEpEI_00011.flac	apart over this season a lot of relationships have been tested uh the show has been getting bigger and
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00001.flac	yeah i mean we're i think the whole team is very worried about it um as our walter
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00002.flac	star bufs or uh for a a company like
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00003.flac	uh was this is a guy with an astranomically high icu and a
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00004.flac	um so yeah you'd think that they'd be able to figure it out but they
id10274_O9xLIdaUG-k_00005.flac	look we all know that you know uh the best therapics in the world has no idea what to do
id10274_YCIIiIR9B60_00001.flac	battle dopressiorn or aniety do you know what to do start reaching out by visiting active minds dot org cb
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00001.flac	and i never once felt the need to put
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00002.flac	i mean you know i think i think the mets have gotten in trouble a lot over
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00003.flac	like to say it was a victory because they i mean i remember sitting here with you probably a year ago
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00004.flac	and uh i was i i think i said something like i think willmer floris is gonna have an exceptional year
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00005.flac	it was a success and i think they exceeded expectations um i loved watching uh them go for it and
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00006.flac	goutwhich was terri's fault which was not mat harvie's fault it's mat's job to say i gotta go out there and it's
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00007.flac	it's not mat harve who's your number one then a debate starts you know and then you gotta pick one of them they're all incredible they're all aces on any other team
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00008.flac	the world is changing twitters changeing everything so i i want na see these guys go
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00009.flac	uh it's a show for you know have a crappy monday  then come home and watch us uh
id10274_s7vZT3_8Smo_00010.flac	you were saying about cobe piatsa has nothing to do withigt but the willpond's
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00001.flac	backyard and they all pack into the tyght little back yard and i think they're crouded behind an u above ground pool is
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00002.flac	and so i mean i was there as a kid so that was eighty six so the mets
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00003.flac	um and also when you're five years old and there's a player named
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00004.flac	because at this point we just want the number one pick right so  actually don't know how it works i mean if you have the worst record in the mb
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00005.flac	to not signe him was the wright movetheyre just it just felt like give the fans something and at that time that's all
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00006.flac	was it was the right basketball mov sure but um i um i'm looking for some love i'm looking for some compassion and we
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00007.flac	um and uh it's been amazing i i really lucked out you know i was syked to get on a tv show and then i wound up on a really fun
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00008.flac	we're already a kinda thing cause i remember when we were doing it like oh theyw're doing another teamn movie cause i think scream had come out and i think can't hardly wait
id10274_wH6ebv-K8AA_00009.flac	and so we're like oh this was great we're doing a movie but uh then it became
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00001.flac	uh if if it was a funny script i mean i didn't think they were gonna do a forthone when they did the forth one i heard about it i was on an audition and someone said to me hay mand they'r making another american piy and i was like no they're notcause
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00002.flac	soom i can't play soccer at all but the weirdest thing is like anyone can put anything on
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00003.flac	going into the show formon was lik oh my god the show was so great everyone was really excited about it t itsyou know it's a really unique blend of comedy and action and procedural
id10274_xbGp2KSUr0E_00004.flac	you know serialized romance stories and we were excited that we had something special but just like you said there's so
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00001.flac	i i kind of had had been in the earlier in my career i played a lot of like the the best
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00002.flac	the the goofhie naber uh the you know so i was playing a lot of characters where kind of along the same lines as joye from friends and i i was trying to make a transition into  more leading man character uh type roles and um and so i i was going through a
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00003.flac	ofof uh a dr spell in my career and i hadn't worked for
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00004.flac	it took a little while for me to convince the the business that um i i could play something other than what i had been playing so when i when i i walked into the test at werehouse thirteen
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00005.flac	i needed a job i wanted a job i just had the my second baby my second son had just been born like two weeks before that and um you know i was i was staring the reality of not having a job or any money you know squarely in the face so um
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00006.flac	there was two of each character whell wheen we walked in there was like seven or eight seven or eight micas and seven or eight
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00007.flac	you just kinda go oh they have no idea what they want we're just the number here and my chance of getting this job
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00008.flac	michas and the pets and going back and forth and going back and forth and um and it kind a was
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00009.flac	it seemed to me that you could kinda tell least a i could tell who was who they were paying attention to and then the guy that went in right before me the director came out
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00010.flac	come here and he put his he put his arm around this guy and he walked down the hall with this guy and i was like
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00011.flac	with the regurgetated worm and and give up the worm and i and i got no worm man i've got
id10275_CVUXDNZzcmA_00012.flac	worm to give and i was actually saying that out
id10275_HK20g60KlTI_00001.flac	unnatural it's it's probably the worst part of being an actor other than not being able
id10275_HK20g60KlTI_00002.flac	yer creg shefer and i'm like oh no no that's okay but then he goes hey creg there's a guy over here hit looks just like you and so then creg shefer
id10275_HK20g60KlTI_00003.flac	somebody will look like me somedaycause i got this new show
id10275_ICEJz3WX2n0_00001.flac	a normally like guys that wear or overalls apparently like the
id10275_ICEJz3WX2n0_00002.flac	and into your pants pockets so there's no real pockets in the
id10275_JbpXWB1V8cA_00001.flac	and who wants to uh who wants to hang around for waiting for your
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00001.flac	uh the the show every week is kind of a minny movie um it's not too serialized so if you miss an episode you won't get completely lost
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00002.flac	and and uh what's for me what's great about the show is i have a couple o
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00003.flac	voice and um the show doesn't talk down to the
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00004.flac	and the adults can both watch at the same time and both find something that interests them and something that they can relate to you know it reminds me of it reminds me of the old days when that used to have the walt disney on sunday night the disney movies on
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00005.flac	whole family would sit around and watch it like you know when kurt rusel did the world's strongest man and stuff like that
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00006.flac	it's it's we don't take ourselves too seriously but at the same time there's some great drama it's a it's our exect producer calls it a thriller omedy
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00007.flac	and uh and that's why i think people should wash it cause i i think everybody can relate to it
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00008.flac	the artifacs in the werehouse are really just plot devices to get us to what the really show is that it's
id10275_LqcUAxrtYOk_00009.flac	and fifty percent uh female viewer ship for si fi
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00001.flac	htime high guys um yeah i mean any time someone has enough interest to fly you across the otion and uh come to to meet the fans of wherehouse thirteen i say i'm doing something right so yeah i'm having a
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00002.flac	um i've been to australia i've been here uh to the ukv times uh to the mmx
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00003.flac	uh i've gone over to parris a few times to do not uh not uh cons but to do press and um so i've been around you know i
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00004.flac	well uh there's a there's a con called dragon con in atlanta where there's
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00005.flac	uh five or six ohoras with no with bunless chaps on so any time you can see an ohora with bunless chaps i say that's a good time right
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00006.flac	s chaps here but if there had been some i would h've had
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00007.flac	uh you know we kinda always role our eyes at what's your favorite art of fact or what's your favorite
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00008.flac	uh no i don't mind uh uh my favorite artefect is uh abraham linkon's hat because peet put it on and had an irresistible urge to free miss fredric so i thought that was pretty
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00009.flac	uh i thought that was a really a just a good episode for the show um if you remember it's part of the two part fhinalie from season three uh whe're
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00010.flac	u it made me uh feel a lot of pride for the show
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00011.flac	i mean the reason i like the show um is that uh it has
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00012.flac	you know it has action it has horror it has
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00013.flac	it has um roman i mean it's it's all it's all the jonrs kindof rapped up into one
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00014.flac	the kids can watch it too you know it doesn't it doesn't talk down to kids but but still the adults can watch it
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00015.flac	you know peet's been sober for thirteen years i've also u i'm also sober thirteen years that's a that's a good one i love comic books
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00016.flac	ii was never a marine i was never  marine but i but i have a great deal of respect for anybody who
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00017.flac	but uh but yeah i think there's there's a a toun of of myself in that
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00018.flac	i don't know a loose cannon that was supposed to be there but uh the funny stuff
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00019.flac	uh you know he's he's one of the funniest i mean he's one of the funniest smartest guys on the planet ur that i've ever met so i think the success of the show is
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00020.flac	um because of him and because of uh scyfi's willingness to let him do what he wants to do on the show
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00021.flac	and uh i'm actually kind of in production with george a ramero um we just finished a a script that we're there we're trying to get made for a new dead movie called rota the
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00022.flac	um it's basically about um humans have now exploited the zambies because that's what we do as humans we
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00023.flac	we exploite everything and uh we've taken the zambies and we've used them for our our own entertainment we've taught them to drive in kind of a um death race where we we watch them  redye
id10275_Mdk1SXywHck_00024.flac	thank you for uh giving me a career thank you for allowing me to have indoor plumming at my house
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00001.flac	thethe second most one that comes up uh is from bons i did a four episode ark on bones as
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00002.flac	her feet um but my hair was a lot different everybody bags on me about my ho m that's the the biggest
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00003.flac	and it's really a great episode um if you like madmen
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00004.flac	it's um ach j wells is on the show this year and we find out that ht wells is actually a a a woman you know because
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00005.flac	uh it was believed or ah j wells believed that people were more likely to believe that a maor that a man had written those stories than a woman so she used a man's face her brothers as as her and wrote as achj wells but
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00006.flac	live as uh souldiers and train them and then
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00007.flac	television i mean that's to me what it's all about so to be able to to do something like that would be uh oud be
id10275_QjrBKqx_Xeo_00008.flac	no we haven't we haven't gotten the uh official greenlight from syfi on season three but i mean it's pretty much
id10275_UBMwbGlSLLg_00001.flac	that i thought for me is would be my favorite is um to have jannus joplin's backstage pash from woodstock and whoever holds that uh backstage pas can travel through time to any concert that has ever been that they wanna go to so i could go to see you know led zepplin
id10275_UBMwbGlSLLg_00002.flac	beatles the dors black sabath cca the band the yard bird
id10275_UBMwbGlSLLg_00003.flac	my uh favorite music that i grew up on that my dad exposed me

id10275_mWZ3l5OoyVI_00002.flac	met my wife before she was my wife i i met this girl and she was
id10275_pV6cJibX6Ik_00001.flac	no no kno you you you wrote about you wrote that on twitter reasently i think
id10275_pV6cJibX6Ik_00002.flac	it's a way to get back to them you know i mean uh people look at it and they're like well like you're gonna
id10275_pV6cJibX6Ik_00003.flac	people come here they save their money they spend their money cause they wanna spend money on the things
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00001.flac	just be a a guy and a a normal guy it's like when i when i
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00002.flac	for the initial audition i i just played it as myself because if i got the job i just have to go to work and be myself
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00003.flac	one of them being that that everybody can watch the show it's not just
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00004.flac	but uh yeah i mean i i like i i like
id10275_vAr7raTthpw_00005.flac	tecups and roses around there but but uh we we certainly love each other and we
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00001.flac	um no the question that then comes up as people say well are you gonna do a second trillgy and i like oh i just finished this
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00002.flac	we i think we jo really well actually and and an actually you know this script was the first time wed written together for quite a few years i think sort of
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00003.flac	id just tryng ta think i guess ta was probably that sort of five years since wed written hot fus wen we had the story idea on the hotfas press tour in like two thousand and seven
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00004.flac	welit was it was at sidney airport iwas ghonna mead a landing from wellington to sidney and i had the idea on the plane and i was thinking about the script that i h'd written when i was twenty one about teen ages on a pubcrol which i'd never done anything with and i didn't necearily wanna make that film now but i thought well maybe there's something in them being adults and
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00005.flac	uh you know there's richer potential in the uh in in the themes that me and simon keep coming back to about perpetually ad ta lesson what if like there's one guy that really wants to do this pub crool again and the other four aren't that
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00006.flac	you know forcibly regresses them or hel breaks lose so i mentioned that idea to simon and then we immediately kinda like sort of started hashing out the story
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00007.flac	but then when we came to write it like years later like it was it was good we'd both had a break we'd both done a lot of other projects and it just um sort of came out very sort of fluidly because we'd had a lot of time to think
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00008.flac	din them in the memoryi didn't need anymore hangovers and stuff but i i ah i' yeah i' done one when i was nineteen which is where the original script came from which was a disaster and then in my late twenties or mid twenties maybe after space and before shorn me and simon and nick ended up in my hometown and we tried to do it again and that went even worse
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00009.flac	so i think sort of then then it startd to really struck me that this was like a
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00010.flac	uh a pethetic sort of like attemt to recapture teenage
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00011.flac	that came from really and then the sort of the the idea of the bluwe kinda ink inside was cause when i was a kid u
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00012.flac	reminded me of school so i wanted to make the actors all feel lhike they were back at school again  going ther hends with
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00013.flac	i didn't even tell empire in london li a sort of i h here's the thing is i get very supersticious about like sort of talking about things before they're done cause i
id10276_3vWez3baO60_00014.flac	ona be the boy who cried wolf and um you know talk about something if it doesn't you know i mean it it will happen but u it's uh i feel very gink
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00001.flac	dressing you know based on the fact that the character has like grown up through this kind of pop culture and that he is like living his
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00002.flac	big daydream i sort of see the film is like a big daydream is thits got pilgrima like a
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00003.flac	character who's in this kind of um you know sort of perpetual adelessence and hasn't really grown up yet and uh he's living his life through the media that he consumes and and what the film is about at the end of senty is about him kind of growing
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00004.flac	so i we go into that to mach  cause like sort of it's it's uh it's also something i haven't worked on that for two years i ve worked on this film solidly for two years so the last time i actually did any work on an
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00005.flac	eight weeks before i starteding this got pilgram and i wasn't around during the shoot at all which was an enormous bumma because i basically lik worked on a film with p vem sperburg and pitter jackson and then i wasn't actually around to be on the set at all
id10276_5WOZXLMujwY_00006.flac	thebot like to actually watch that all in in in action but um in the case of that one i didn't try and graft my own personality on it we just tried to be true to hurja
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00001.flac	thin you have to watch anything before the new one um i would have all three movies o stand aline
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00002.flac	brian and forbs the stepford wives and uh very brian forbs nineteen seventy five
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00003.flac	i i i'd like to think that me and simon and nick would work together again i mean
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00004.flac	it was six years since ho fas and um you know we really um
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00005.flac	sort of moved everything else away so that we could make this one and um before it was too late so i'm really i'm really
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00006.flac	he does these incredible vocal warmups just before a take which is something to witnuss so it's quite
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00007.flac	idon't know i um i actually there's quite a few zomby things i have not seen
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00008.flac	books comics films games uh there's a certain part of me that kind of felt like i'd sort of
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00009.flac	king might win because i'm not sure that he'd fight entirely faire maybe nic
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00010.flac	s is is amazing and brian's ending its great and uh i don't think they really
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00011.flac	we we always knew it was gonna be something slightly different and brian actually was involved in writing the final scene we actually
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00012.flac	involved in it and he was very srtof happy with the idea that het would diverge
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00013.flac	hin because got pilgrim like touched on a number of jonras like action comedy romance
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00014.flac	action it was always gonna be a slightly harder sell and i think you know
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00015.flac	i think it wasn't because it wasn't completely generic like sometimes people just want like o
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00016.flac	have no idea what that is so i think it's just down to sort of if you're trying to do something slightly different you just gotta work twice as hard
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00017.flac	and it was a tough film to kindaf likes o explaine so i i think that's the
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00018.flac	but the at the on the flip side of it lik i was very proud of the movie
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00019.flac	winerever and um but we alll were very proud of this show
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00020.flac	and we just had sort of faith in it and then it eventually found its audience on dvd so i sort of when when i went through the same thing on this got pilgram i i i just ally sort of have faith in what i'd made  and thet it would get out there and i feel that
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00021.flac	films that are massive massive hits kind of like do ther a couple of months at the cinemar and then never get sceen on the big screen ever again irl never never be ever on
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00022.flac	see them ever aga and what's really nice is thats go pigram like somewhere in the world is playing like
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00023.flac	you know like the prince charles show all the time and like the new beverly in los angeles and i like that i think that that makes me very happy that people are still seying it with a croud you know and also that it's
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00024.flac	no i think sort of i i think i already got all of thaut an my sister ands got pill wem i feel that an thit's myght be contravertial to say i maybe dunkan jones would war o warcraft is the mae to to beat it but there has never been a good vidio game film and i think the so far and the reason for that is is it's just like um
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00025.flac	starring you in the face is that a video game is like a sort of a unique experience to you you are playing the game and just like watching somebody
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00026.flac	my answer is there is no game i would like to wo a maybe rampa
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00027.flac	being so kind of impassioned about lights or what they
id10276_5YncBThNd5E_00028.flac	mean chris nowlan's back man he's very different to tim burns back man which is very different to addam west bat man and there's room for all three it's
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00001.flac	no i i don't really read too much of the stuff that gets in my way
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00002.flac	but for some reason i read this one and i could see straight away why they'd given it to me and actually i think i read the first book coing fo hutel hadn't come out ye actually thinking about thats
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00003.flac	e was just of te shon of the dead and um and just reading it if anything actually reminded me a bit of space
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00004.flac	you know so it was the chance to ho fas and so and the dead even though they have really ridiculous things in them they both take place in a real world where like people dy and don't come back and
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00005.flac	was interesting to me because it's both highly relatable like it takes place
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00006.flac	in you know it's essentially about a bunch of people in their teams in early twenty
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00007.flac	but it uh it's got a sort of a slightly magical feeld to it in a world where anything
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00008.flac	i think it was pretty instinctive ii i don't know what a straiter version of scot pilgrim visto the world would be when people sort of of asked me um like um you know how far it's too far and i was thinking i don't really know how a soft peddler film like this i think it's especially when you read the souce material and you know andan what it's about and the tone of it it just it felt like it was
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00009.flac	you know a license to let my imagination run right a little bit and i think that's what's kind of like tat's fun and fresh about it like um so um
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00010.flac	you knw when people have asked me that i kind of ponderd a thinking i don't know what a rat version of scot pilgrim would be but the whole the whole kind of the the whole
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00011.flac	raizing detr of the whole piece is tha you're essentially seeing the film that's playing in scot pilgrim's head and schot pilgrim is a character in his early twentyes who has grown up on saterdy morning
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00012.flac	commic books and video games and probably too much shugery product and you're watching kind of like how he would like to live
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00013.flac	yeaha little bit i mean i i definitely was that kid at school i i i when i was at school uh comprehensive i was shortsited i didn't know i was shortsited until i was twenty and as such i would frequently look out of the window like at in classes because i couldn't see the blackbor properly and
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00014.flac	and dudlling kind of like rock band not unlike sexpabom on my schoolbook even like the look of sexparbom when they're playing and they have kind of lightning bolts and jacket lines coming out i you know i would describe it to the animatersas i said it should look like a a fourteen year old idea of a rock band um and so
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00015.flac	you know sco prim as a character is twenty two but sometimes he he acts like a twelve year old and i can definitely empathize with him
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00016.flac	was around so h scorpigram is an interesting character cause like he's he's quite a flawed hero you get the feeling that he kindaf
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00017.flac	he would get distracted by a like sort of a a berito as much as he would a next kind of gorgious girl that walks by
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00018.flac	yes a no it was a it was a pretty organic process i mean we had a structure worked out as far back as two thousand
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00019.flac	new material as it kinda came together brion when we first started riting we had three books and
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00020.flac	tree books and thenit kept developing righ ptill shooting so even in the sixth book we knew how it was gonna end and then we even
id10276_AeZoMAJ4Ejs_00021.flac	you know tha reflected like some of the final sort of passaages of um book six so it's been a the a good organic proces there were times whan we worked in tandum there were times when brian took some lines out of the screen play and put them in the books which was very sotof pleasing you know so there's a couple of lines in vollume four and five that come from our screen play
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00001.flac	really like what we did like the world's end is a is a real pub name in fact there were like several in the uka thet's one in particular that me and simon ou
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00002.flac	i at the world's end i'll meet you at the world's end so when we wrot the
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00003.flac	names to illoustrate what was happening in each one so leh we wanted them to feel like tarrocards it was like the name  co tells you
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00004.flac	it's like film is a visual mediam like sort of you know if you' like look ing it's the ground you may as well be at the theater
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00005.flac	aliens literally represent kind of like thatmasof identity is like this sort of like
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00006.flac	absolutely like i think sort of w with this it was definitely like sortf because it was the culmination of like um shonand hot firs which were all jonr film as we wannta
id10276_AjY0B7kh_-k_00007.flac	you know  my my script didn't lite feature that at all so like it wasn't like a it's not a problem for me you know like uh i
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00001.flac	oum you would want the audience to see it as the jurnisse which is cold so why would you wanna spoil of
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00002.flac	i think is i no i think it's just it's pretty obvious as that you want people to see it
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00004.flac	like sort of juvinile antic so it was a sort of a film a about regression and about the perrils of lightn es dowger and like how it's dangerous to go backwords and like how you can never go home again so we thought like you know we we both mean simina from like small towns it came to london so whenever we go back it's always a a strange and simetimes bits a sweet experience and we thought that was a great kind of like templay for aside five
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00005.flac	absolutely no i would never rul anything out it's definitely um i i don't i don't know why people would think it was a godbiy to to the uka if you know i had a a blast make in this film and it was
id10276_CAhGBfTmCHw_00006.flac	cause i haven't really started on it so i don't have a lot to uh disgust
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00001.flac	and even to the point where there's the big kind of uh sonic face off between two bands
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00002.flac	i in like the summer of two thousand and eight um i asked nigal godrige to get involved in the film
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00003.flac	it's the first scor he's ever done but prior to that way before like eighteen months before we started to get the artist together to portray the different band
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00004.flac	ywold sung in the film why dosn't dan do that and so he did the pitel number cornelius who i'm a huge fannoof
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00005.flac	hi sexpabom playing was designed in the tatings to be a lot shorter the type sis was was really short and then we actually expended the
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00006.flac	the the pning song changed uh one of the songs hat was gonabe on the endcredit nigal rtf said oh yhe can't sink that som on the incredits surely that should be the one
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00007.flac	you're shooting i think iand this sounds great you know maybe we should so it went far away from the original idea of hearing or not hearing the
id10276_CooJzMgoxzw_00008.flac	it feels in that respect you know it does start to reelize like a more like a seventys film life
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00001.flac	taed this one ire was something where the jonra like like a lot of sifi movies is tha that the jonra came out of like a manifestation of of the fhear in a way and the movie is about um people returning to that hometown and realizing that time has marched on without them and simon's character is a man who's forty who wants to be eighteen again so like the kind of the the actual the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00002.flac	the aliens in the movie essentially represent the kind of that fear of change and that loss of identity so this arl of the things came together it itsantially like i literally like when i was like um in my mid twenties when i sort we used to go back to my hometown every like kind of like holidays like um
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00003.flac	i would uh like sort of you know get increcingly kindof like sort of um emused by the fact like oh like nobody remembers me like none of the bartenders remember me the school bully doesn't remember me it's like i it's not so much that i never left it's like i was never here and i remember saying to a friend of mine like way that i said well every time i go back to my hometown it feels like a invasion of the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00004.flac	town so like little ideas like that like stick is like okay you can never go home again you feel
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00005.flac	ik a bigger reason and in the movie like sort of like so all of these things sort of came together it's like we wanted to do a movie about kind of like
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00006.flac	the dangers of nes dowager and r like a man trying to turn back the clock and you know but then even just the thing of like a homecoming is that sort of like
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00007.flac	ct of it is as much a coping stratagy for me as simon as it is for garry king is that like he's almost there's a scen in the movie where he finds out that like something's a foot and he's happy when he's talking
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00008.flac	he can accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older like the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00009.flac	he's not as big a legand as he thinks he is and that the town wasn't all it was cracked out to be anyway so i think in this particular case it was something like this is the story which is like sort of like uh thethe the syfi is a
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00010.flac	ike something's a foot and he's happy when he's talking about him and the reason he's happy is he's
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00011.flac	he can accept that more readily than the idea that he's getting older like the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00012.flac	tha he's not as big a legand as he thinks he is and that the town wasn't all it was cracked out to be anyway so i think in this particular case it was something like this is the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00013.flac	because it's like a satire on stuff we draw a very sharp line in the sand at the end
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00014.flac	with the drunk humans you only have one choice there is no riddeleground you know so but then like the what the movie is about like is is the
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00015.flac	you know like tha our u our hero like simon's character and it is extremely flowred and is like makes a lot of bad decisions and does some terrible things you know like and he's very questionable like in his uh motives a lot of the time and yeat when it comes down to it is that what makes is human is like the fact that we are flored and make mistakes the kee is can you learn from your mistakes so the we want it to make something whi's like sort of like um you know it has this kind of like big sort of philosofical sifi climac but with drunk people
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00016.flac	plans other than that we'd like to work together and like i think the thing is lhake sort of like am we're very proud that we did this third movie and um as much as fans wanted us to do another one we wanted to do another one you know but the the the other thing is that the sort of tha maybe fans don't know is how hard it is to get these movies made so like you know if if you want us to do another film
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00017.flac	set specific criteria for these movies is that they're all like jonrof films that are really like trogian horces for the relationship movies um
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00018.flac	like they're all about like perpetual adelessence uh los of identity the indivision of us as the collective they're all about growing up
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00019.flac	those themes so i think that means if we did a another film together we might do something
id10276_FDhJhEu0JUM_00020.flac	ther'  all three of the movies hart fis shorn and this one they all have endings that like
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00001.flac	sify film um i like the film uh sal basses film pase four which is abou
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00002.flac	and uh and it's really spooky it's kindo like a mix
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00003.flac	super macro lenzes tthere's a really spooky film good performance is really great photography i watched it on tv when i was a little kid and then like it finally come back
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00004.flac	um spanish director who only did one ofther film which is also a a
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00005.flac	but it's about um a couple that go to a spanish iland uh where kids ave taken over the kids don't say anything and it's kind olike it's like the birds with little kids and it's particularly like grim and spooky
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00006.flac	it was also known in the seventies as iland of the damed and uh both films by that director it's i h uh both great
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00007.flac	that's really worth watching um it's by the same team that did
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00008.flac	charity event in this village which then gets taken over by terorists so then the olympic
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00009.flac	iis so much fun born to fight i highly recomend it i've been trying to get hold of a print of it cause i want ta show it to a audience cause i watched on dvl and it's just
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00010.flac	abscure but it was for quite a while quite difficult to get hold of is darioagentos four flyes on greay velvet which is i
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00011.flac	and um and then the title itself i probably shouldn't tell you what the title refers to cause it kindaf gives away the
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00012.flac	i's like a great warmup to that basically so that's a little bit more a little
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00013.flac	in preparation for hot fis called live like a cop dye like a man
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00014.flac	c and then there's this accustic jo who is singing sort of sappy
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00015.flac	in this kind of um hippy wastlennd and it's one of those films it has like it has big dance numbers in it it's got sort ofquite a big budget bu like amazing bisar designe the coreographer
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00016.flac	and then y years later i ran into him in a la and he remembered me and said he has it going en wachin your films ad said you didn't tell me about the apple
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00017.flac	i wanto  new all about the apple that's definitely worth watching it has an amazing ending where it looks like they ran out of money or something happened where just as it's getting to what should be its third act the film abruptly stops with an intervention by god literally like in one scene one of the characters says mister tops is coming and mier tops turns out to be
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00018.flac	youe watching ad you kind of think this is so crool this is like a sort of an of extrem
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00019.flac	deserves the prank so i i would say like some people who watch it say oh this film is so crool and yet there are some amazingly funny bits in it it's definitely can get it on dvd i'm not sure i ever saw r a theatrical really so the do festivalis but it's called windy city heet and it's um it's
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00020.flac	i would i would i would recommend it i would necessarily um condone it i would never make the movie
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00021.flac	like his french film point blank um which i presume is called something else in france
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00022.flac	you can get it on a bf um dd and it's actually as short but it
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00023.flac	and basically they all diye horribly and when each one dies n
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00024.flac	was i'd always sort of i didn't know what the title of it was i 'd mised the title and then much later i found it it was called apatchiese and it was directed by john mackenszie and it's on um uh a bfi dvl called like stop look an listen one of those
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00025.flac	is a little known nineteen ninety five film called a fist full of fingers it was directed by edgar howard right uh he was twenty at the
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00026.flac	u you might look out for a young fresh faced twenty year old actor calld edger wrigte who appears in one scene before briefly getting shot it also features uh enry bedel arip true jerrim vidle is in the movie
id10276_HrA2BLcLApA_00027.flac	uh i believe the director had to make it like um pad it out to get to ceventy eighte minutes
id10276_P91fRfZ0PEE_00001.flac	welone thank you  for not asking an atma question and b  no it's true i am developing a horror movie it's funny cause people always ask me if i'm ever gonna do a film of don't and a i wouldn't because i think you've already seen the funniest version of that and b i wantna do a straight horor movie and i have this idea for like i guess it's like doing an like an english jalo type movie i really like thos kind of dreamy like
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00001.flac	rit and this is a hastily written list of my favorite films af two thousand thirteen but witrh a disclamer because it's uh the twenty sixt of november and there are a lot of awardsy films that come out in the last couple of months of the year that i have not yet sceen so this does not include the following films because i
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00002.flac	a great film short term twelve with bree larson who i'e
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00003.flac	wodyelen's blue jasmin i saw that twice and uh and i
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00004.flac	favorite film of the year another film that's quite divisive but i loved it is harmeny carin's spring breakers which i
id10276_S0j29b3KVWQ_00005.flac	from the year which i've seen twice on the big screen and would plann to see a third time itold be alfhonso coron's gravity which i think is extraordinary and i recommend
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00001.flac	i can't quite believe it either actually it was like sof cause it actually was like i'm very pleased with the en resout but it was the i
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00002.flac	you know how do we do it in twelve weeks with all the fight scenes and i said well you know the the traid off is that to get to shoot like um
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00003.flac	gonna happen in i and we we and we then we tried once we had what the scene was we tried to
id10276_X1Yr4eI2oRw_00004.flac	and um i was sitting on the plane and i i had uh i think it was around the time that super bad was about to come out and i was thinking about that film and uh and
id10276_XunbBdgkGwU_00001.flac	um i i see myself in garry king a little bit as well and i sort of  i think sort of like thet you gotta have simpathy for your characters because even though the character like the the simon players jis like a sort of walking car crasshe of a man you know he' still like he hits rob bottom but he still kind of rises up to be a hero that's important it's tha youve got to kind of like um we we don't write characters that we don't have
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00001.flac	like two weeks ago so it still feels pretty fresh fresh to me so like
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00002.flac	it's always funny when people watch a new film and they say so what's next i said why don't you just wath thi
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00003.flac	we literally just finished it like y at least at least hold up to like about three or four
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00004.flac	so um i i feel i feel i feel very nice in terms of life
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00005.flac	this film that made me quite kind of like u emotional lie just watching them in a way because
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00006.flac	you know i think in a similar way to shon it gets kind of uh as well as it being like funny in action pact it gets kind of a bit deeper emotionally sometimes
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00007.flac	friends who have a rift and i think a lot of people have that experience of like sort of the people that you thought when you were nineteen you were gonna be best friends with forever maybe you're not as close anymore and it's really a film of
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00008.flac	well uh the the theme on e stager in the movie is obviously very strong it's almost like it's garri's worst enimy if anything the the villan of the piece in the movie is nestaga because like simon's character garry
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00009.flac	it's convinsed that he wants to relive his ninetee ninety glory days and it's that thing of that you should be careful what you wish for because when they they do attemt to recreate it things go badly wrong and also
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00010.flac	you know what the film is about is that sort of the the difference between uh your kind of like rose tinted like sort of memory of the past and the reality of it and so and then once you ad alcoholin to the mix it becomes like this kind of like time machine sending you back to being teenages again so it's definitely the whole film is like aa a a bit of a uh
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00011.flac	in terms of li the other actors in it it was definitely important to us that it wasn't so much about well this a couple of things you're right about space is that the one person from space you hadn't been in any
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00012.flac	andwe had written a role for him in the sho on the dead which then got cut out he didn't shoot it we just kinda had the script hoe fusy was
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00013.flac	um and then we ante also make sure that the people who were in the first two movies uh one and two like hotfers and shan would also be in this one so that's
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00014.flac	i think it's because i i i grew up in a small town in england you know like wells in sammacet where i grew up is very
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00015.flac	so as a result i feel like sort of like most of the film that i've made have some larger form of escapeism in them in terms of in space i's no different about like here's my
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00016.flac	and and this is different in a way in terms of it's actually sort of uh like you know at the start of the movie
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00017.flac	epic night as being like the sort of the most action packt night ever and then the irony is when he tries to recreate it it really
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00018.flac	it only really comes challenging when it comes into marketing and stuff because i think if you had to cut together a trailer that said it was just about friends drinking  the pub then i think a twentieth of the audience would
id10276_YloBWJxXzMI_00019.flac	so you have to at least hint that there's gonna be some kind of like sort of you know u like big scale kind of uh action and special effects so there's lots of there's lots of things that aren't in the trailer that we have kindaf kept to ourselves but you know youe gotta put enough action and special effects into the trailer so people wall
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00001.flac	sort of sad o was there anything you had to cut out o thinkin well not really i think we kindo wentn we went bfore it i mean my main thing i definitely though what i mean is the
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00002.flac	you know it makes it very kind of like uh challenging to kindof try and makeit
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00003.flac	as it is so i indi i i kind af feel like that as a film finer i sometimes i watch some samma films which you heare about that cost like two hundred million and you watch it  going where did it go whay do they spend it all on that one
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00004.flac	ior something and so u'm you know like  with this film i just thinking i sort of to make sure
id10276_aaJo0S1lnhY_00005.flac	like some people it's the same way that some girls don't like being called cute its like h you'r really ku saing i don't like that word its the same way that some guys are saying oh you're so nice it's like sort of like o don't wanna be nice i wantna be like i i wantnto be a
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00001.flac	w some of that stuff is the wetter boys uh we can't we we we kind of um we worked kind of hard at trying
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00002.flac	make the plot and the characters work so some of the kind o snowy stuff and some of the references like say the kind of you know the crob with he
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00003.flac	uh i was wondeing if they had opien it in the metin at the end but um wheno the tha a lot of that stuff is the is the the wisr tha wetter kind of putting tintend references into the cornerof every frame i guess the sort of if there's a favorite one i think hurga drawing tintin's portrat right the stars
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00004.flac	there was a thing that uh like john hur would be a good calculist but then somebody pointed out that john hurt plays calculos and the
id10276_cytGIvwJ3NA_00005.flac	think uh maybe it was like a pantamime thomson i could be one of the thompsons and have like a manickin next to me as another
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00001.flac	where's mack carde now one direction of the biggest that ye're gonna go down to earth and take over sise then
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00002.flac	of harry stas and the aliens all bow down and then you just have to pretend to be harry
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00003.flac	i would be stuck on that line in trafalgar squere and i would know that particular issue if
id10276_lWeNK_hi-aI_00004.flac	it would mean nothing anymore because i'd just be on that lion thay'd be like my little kind of like the little um sort of safe havon that's gonna last for like seventy two hours and then i would probably give myself up to the onbes i'd be so like um hungry
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00001.flac	sic uh as mostly commedic actors and then the rest of the village of sanford are played by real
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00002.flac	living legends and uh proper likte thisps so that was fun to do and it was you know to have those people in a big
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00003.flac	umble and to be playing often with different actors from different
id10276_wVIZhnJ79sI_00004.flac	you know we haven't really got the the budget to kinda like be sort of thos riphing
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00001.flac	who was running mtm at the time came back had just come back from
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00002.flac	the schedueling and i got a rumor or two
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00003.flac	ta i i hear stories that were in trouble
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00004.flac	i was just there if i thought we were in trouble i wouldave stayed there and faught for the
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00005.flac	uh been canceled had it not been for the contravercy that arose ver my uh stand ona
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00006.flac	to be taken down to uh elsalvadore
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00007.flac	uh with uh uh uh drugs and medicins for the people in the hills who weren't getting it the compasinos the
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00008.flac	um it was also to call attention to elsalvador by this by this act which is why we gathered and watshed him le
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00009.flac	as with the strike became the because i had the valiable show on tv i became
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00010.flac	delivered the speech of uh uh of anouncsement for the
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00011.flac	said uh master adne you say you're in favor of free elections in elsalvador o what if that election turns out a communist
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00012.flac	noi went on to answer another question and all the time in my brain i'm saying uh uh uh have i come this far
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00013.flac	so i turned back to that guy again after i answered the next question and e said i i wasn't satisfie with my answer what i would want to say is
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00014.flac	so i turned back to that guy again after i answered the next question and  said i i wasn't satisfie with my answer what i would want to say is
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00015.flac	a lot of controversy arose up a couple of congressmen wanted lead a boycod on lo grant
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00016.flac	i had the newspaper in greensberg pensilvania and he wrote the editorial in any other country edward awasner wod be taken out and shot
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00017.flac	bout you know blob blobblo thank god this is american so wat and so on and you felt the regret that this wasn't any other country for him
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00018.flac	sent me a letter showing what they had done tha called in to say that they
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00019.flac	kimberly clark saying that uh they wanted to express their appreciation at their sponsership of the show and they would continue to
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00020.flac	gant we are pleased proud to inform you that we will no longer be
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00021.flac	so two out of three were brich this is at a point where we'r
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00022.flac	uh one producer said uh we think there are two ways of doing things the way the show does it and the way you're doing itan we think our ways
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00023.flac	at me primarily by charltain heston among  many others and i would answer either aserbicaly or honestly and or
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00024.flac	but it it it seemed to require a response silence not seem
id10278_DSGE2F5sTcg_00025.flac	of course u had i been more sephisticated would realize it would now lead to another response and it would re feature their initial attack

id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00005.flac	do this or allow this to be done to itself or
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00006.flac	so that takes care of at least a majority
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00007.flac	i don't know i don't know uh but i think uh  to to for people to ask that
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00008.flac	uh to bring the liberals out in force bus the fact uh perhaps they
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00009.flac	all of the information that uh is talke about the uh the evils of a
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00010.flac	and the purity of the reble movement uh maybe they choose to believe that make it symplify for them
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00011.flac	i i'm sure there is a segment of the anti war movement
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00012.flac	e les belacos party the democrats although it's hard to tell the difference
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00013.flac	i am i'm not pleased with the presidents performance with her without
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00014.flac	uh hollywood actors ware at least putting out some semblence of beauty or style or
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00015.flac	unfair to list them as as part of the one percent
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00016.flac	would be much better spent on the corporations who get away with not paying taxes on ther corporations and individuals who get away with
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00017.flac	and i don't think there are that many hollywood actors who are stealing money these days it's been a somewhate
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00018.flac	to uh to uh sell all kinds of american products we uh we have been
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00019.flac	different i would love to see the fact that uh most people
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00020.flac	could understand what socialism means and onder how it benefits the individual and how there are various socialist practices at work in this country even though we're a corparatocracy but i would like to see it advanced even more so that our people i mean to to read in the paper how
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00021.flac	in congress vote against food stamps and at the same time take millions of
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00022.flac	ad from the government for their agricultural farms
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00023.flac	if if the exposure would be widespred i mean who is this guy  the guy from tennac i bel i can't remember his name three point two million dollars he got from the government last year and he voted against food stamps and most of those republicans and most of them a a
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00024.flac	fall into his corpratitigenda ut that's the other thing i wanted to point out
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00025.flac	thso called anti war liberals in hollywood who haven't spoken up i think they read the figures and they see that the vast majority of the american people are against another war yet another war and they were stung at their treatment uh with george bush in a rack so they uh they they felt that it was not an urgent case for them to rush forward on this one with the majority of the american people are
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00026.flac	so things that we have finally reached a point in this country where enough people are educated and enough people are
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00027.flac	looking ar witness enough to history to see that we
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00028.flac	gom up revup jas up another war to uh to
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00029.flac	kick start the economy we have done it too many times vet nom was

id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00036.flac	some say it's environment some say h some ha've tried to say that it
id10278_Pp-rAswo4Xg_00037.flac	and it falls in within a spectrom that has commanded more and more attention as we
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00001.flac	the the shows were the the funniest shows i had seen since i'd been in californiaa the best
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00002.flac	and i  i was enormously blithe about
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00003.flac	when will we have had a chance to do such wonderful characters and such a wonderful
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00004.flac	plenty of time that with the resources given to him
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00005.flac	uh should be expected to have ted bacxter as his news man and to
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00006.flac	u hiere marry tatar more totally in
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00007.flac	i i suppose so i don't know where one stop

id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00009.flac	e in the seven years of of uh of lu ground i would say that i used a lot of
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00010.flac	my brothers their devilish aspects
id10278_QOq66XogW3Q_00011.flac	but when i got into somber lu grand of lu
id10278_QiMd9_dc-M4_00001.flac	uh i also felt that they would i wante to do u  not because i really wanted to do that character but
id10278_QiMd9_dc-M4_00002.flac	to think that they wouldn't get enough white actors to support them in this venture
id10278_QiMd9_dc-M4_00003.flac	whether it was the fact of impending faliure that made fredy silver
id10278_R_h7875g_PI_00001.flac	and there were two shows left and jey had a vacation

id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00015.flac	i found  years later when i left merry turned to them and said are you
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00016.flac	and they got enough to satisfy themselves they they had a number of people uh gavan macclod was in to see them just before
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00017.flac	i found  years later when i left merry turned to them and said are you shot
id10278_iEAqbqZ7dDg_00018.flac	and the response was that' your lu granp so i wanted i guess they wanted to see how much of a jerk i was willing to make myself
id10278_pJsgUla1_1I_00001.flac	i'm deligted to appear on cbs again after they abruptly canceled my show
id10278_qN6dBTlT3HA_00001.flac	elvics had his entorage of uh good old boys with him at that time
id10278_qN6dBTlT3HA_00002.flac	and he was going through his coraty pase so his fingers were all being
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00001.flac	alan and jim to produce the showcause i trusted them in
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00002.flac	so i signed the deal with with sbs uh and i guess they clinched alan and
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00003.flac	out of that they brought gean rennels on who was the most unbelievable researcher in the world and he went all over the country
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00004.flac	to coach and guid us i was placed under under orders by alan and jim when ire gonna be down on the set like we were with the three camera show it's up to you to maintain the um the flame of lu gran
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00005.flac	who the character is and keep him alive and so wot ime and i got down on that floor and uh with a single camera and a new crew and so forth and so on and begin slogging through the first show
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00006.flac	and grimising on that set to punch whatever i'm finding funny and to make sure that the audience knows this is a laugh here and this is my old stunt there i was becoming a nervous reck
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00007.flac	and that went on for about six or seven shows and i was having a myserable time
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00008.flac	i didn't last long with this guy but the one of the prises i did get from him is after the show
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00009.flac	and i don't know that you can see  the slightest bit of difference between that show and this
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00010.flac	gun control which nobody seems to wanna touch at that time
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00011.flac	during the vast majority of he of the marry tily mor show i was the chief i was the six hundred pound garilla
id10278_rgcxEM5jOc4_00012.flac	andu i always i mean i felt like such a fish out of water because i'd gotten this unbelievable plum given to me by by charle and i thought i knew newspapers and journalism fairly well
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00001.flac	ers that they could mean something to him and he could mean
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00002.flac	uh the stories i could have heard the companionship we could have had i was the youngest of five so the others were all running iner
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00003.flac	who uh the cole miners were striking at the time and among other things and i said well you gotta do something about those strike
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00004.flac	and i think that influenced me in terms of  union activities the rest of my life i had a great
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00005.flac	hand i figured he witnessed a lot that he didn't talk about but he was a
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00006.flac	uh my sisters uh m they were a great soff both were social workers at one point great my my brothers were strong and bright and sharp
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00007.flac	syce i became au an actor on two
id10278_s_rtHBpzrQc_00008.flac	it allowed me to esscape into my romantic it was safe adventure  acting as safe
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00001.flac	would drive us nuts because they'd they'd work a scene to death and work ja sandrich to death trying to shape it up to to their tastt and we'd be waiting in our dressing rooms waiting to work and you know biing bing bing when we worked the boysroda mary fillics wa the treo the three
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00002.flac	so the only time i remember something being discused
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00003.flac	uh ted had a turn by himself and gavin and i were sitting in the stands
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00004.flac	now i want you to watch this i'm gonna try it this way this time tell me which e thing
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00005.flac	we would struggle and strive to get it write the first time here he flips this one over and then he does it the second way and he does that and he comes back again he sas now this time i'm gona i'm gonna try it this way tell me which  think he dryd i a third way
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00006.flac	and finally when he did it it was primarily the first meathod he used to present
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00007.flac	our time on stage was limited once roda went off and did her own
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00008.flac	sought to be as supportive in every way to each other as they as they could be
id10278_shA_TsV-PFs_00009.flac	this wonderful band of lunies around her with her being the
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00001.flac	nd yea i i could never say no matter how nice he was although i must say when i
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00002.flac	the the best example is le grant who said i was married to a
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00003.flac	needed him uh that's that's a strang how man he ti i need him maybe once or twice as president of the gild he was sweet to me he was open to me always took my calls and i think he did great
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00004.flac	made from that and to porit all
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00005.flac	ovely to uh just being around him uh but jack was and jack just kept getting better and better as an actor all his life
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00006.flac	unfortunately when my scene with him where i pystal with him i um used a ruber gun and uh twice without knowing it i reaked his face
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00007.flac	that was so pillaried and editorialized against as that film before it
id10278_x5dqrDlwxR4_00008.flac	the the the uh the arts pages were filled with op ed piecesby some of the biggest writers in the country saying what a liye what a scandal what this the u you know i don't even know if they had seen the picture yet it had n't opitr but they were out

id10279_4Q1IvdayPR8_00005.flac	sometimes in films you see a lot of the actors and they're always playing the sane type of character but that's how that's who they really are and that's great

id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00009.flac	soo i always worry about other studios because i know they wantnao get to the animations uh uh domination kind of
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00010.flac	i i i'm i'm in i i'm in all f the episodes uh and i think one of my favorites
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00011.flac	i would say uh wy there's two of them there's thundercone um uh where where you coun see nepolion's fighting skills
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00012.flac	uaand how we go about that and then there's the other one where we becomes lagger town where all the
id10279_DTbpchx4xes_00013.flac	you know uh animals can talk gosts can happen people can blow up my head cal blow up and it's okay
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00001.flac	uh starving starving artist project igh sp um and he explained to me about what it was about and how he wanted to started up start ed up and it reminded me of how i
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00002.flac	that could help guied me to the direction of what's going you know i think for anybody who started
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00003.flac	i they coud have something out there they could give them some proper gudnes to
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00004.flac	i ha i have some nowllege and with that nowlege i take on then move forward um into my own endevors but for somebody who's starting out whether you're a painter a musician or an actor uh director or a writer or anything they have to do wih the art uh
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00005.flac	that there are there are people there you know that that that care about the
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00006.flac	sometimes it could be a lonely roade you know where you meet somebody who can say you know what keep doing it this isis the right direction
id10279_IvOQNamNtF4_00007.flac	to be told to get you point point eight point eht uh so so something like the
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00001.flac	fwell i'm actually working on a show called esbonon down for achbo with uh danny mack briadand steven littel and uh will farol so but i'm here actually to support the sinical uh film festival i got one of the films called uh penson
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00002.flac	that's right tha's actually right and there's actually uh ceveral other films they got a film from argentin that's gonna be uh uh airing tonight
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00003.flac	um and then there's several workshops there's a workshop that's being done by arlane who's actually in greays anatamy uh whell she talkes about making it in hollywood and um for those of you gus who are really intereted in being in the business i think it's uh it's a
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00004.flac	to not only hear it from an actress but to hear her perspective becuse i believe she's from this town and from
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00005.flac	the glam life and the the hollywood life where you wanna talk about going to the parties and meaning directors but and that's great but the truth is it starts off uh in your college ou'r starts t starts of foith he community where you'r
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00006.flac	do short films to independent films and grow on to making big future films but uh the it's a quality of work and a lot of people think about just just writing something and throwing it
id10279_PQHz4fGHPK8_00007.flac	do that i think it's it's really sitting down with great mentors who understand the business and understand the art and if you put those to together and really create something great then it will be big i i i could put my soul into that cause that's what i
id10279_Tm9IlscJgCw_00001.flac	soi i one one of my nurty tkethons is the fact that i am truly a big fan
id10279_UwVmHtdkruw_00001.flac	and besides its comedy and and and many people of our generations coau sit down d watch and enjoy
id10279_UwVmHtdkruw_00002.flac	you just like the impact towards you you you you would hope that any work you do will
id10279_bmoAV7tZziI_00001.flac	but jest case a she's a personality actress you know she's an entertainer and this role was talered for her where she gets to play

id10279_rPcBjEZlHdo_00001.flac	uh you getta sa if you vote for me all of your wil hese deams ae come true co get ta sayt with a uh you get to rase your ras it one
id10279_uC-yAeDEzFA_00001.flac	that's it but i'm no secret man i just like to keep it real and uh
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00001.flac	it this uh with her next tora naghbor called pig otherwise nanus daron amd when the two of them get together they' well they've just theye spent their whole lives together they'e never really grown up they're just like kids really excited they do the same things they've always done they don't let the outside world in
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00002.flac	they're just in their own little world and completely unaware of anything else that's going on am there's a lot of energy to both of them um
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00003.flac	you know if it's getting two ot a hand she's always the one to bring them back down um cause pigs  like it's a bit more
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00004.flac	mad than she is but he never gets to express that because she's always there to bring him back to kind of reality in a way she's also a lot deeper then and like more in touch with her feelings and
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00005.flac	but he's just you know everything's just kind of black and white um so it's kinda hard to talk about the characters seperate because they're so close together dou know i mean you have to talk about
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00006.flac	kind of rutine they play the same games they have these role plays that they play the whole time
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00007.flac	um we're just like the games that kids would play we're like we play that game again yeah okay and they're into the game you know and you grow awa to that as you go
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00008.flac	of their world like and when when they get to the palese it's gonna be amazing they'l
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00009.flac	king and queen of their world um so i think that ront knows she will get to the pales eventually
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00010.flac	i just found it really strange but then after that i got into i and just completely fell in love with it and i like i'm a complet sukerfr
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00011.flac	there's a big difference to this one the bas of it is a complete love story
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00012.flac	it's it gets very dark and it gets really interesting in that way and because
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00013.flac	reflect a lot of relationships in the sense that you know when you first meet someone your relationship keeps growing and growing whatever relationship it is like especially like with a boy girl an and when you get past a certain stage if you're not prepared to keep changing with the relationship if one person says the same you know t mean if they don't change
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00014.flac	it's going na end one person might want what the other one doesn't and that happens all the time and
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00015.flac	and as well because it's so intense and it is unhealthy because they haven't developed properly
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00016.flac	she you can see hir even when she's reading back over you know with the sides you know  for doing the scene and she's kind a thinking of maybe to ad something else to it and
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00017.flac	you know to mean live in a um i don't think it's a a matter of age it's just a matter of understandingness um
id10280_9AtE4C309P8_00018.flac	i don't know wonce wince can feel the story like cause a lot of people would read it and just not get it at all because of the way it's written and then like you need to see it performed where as other
id10280_IhCiRuNjZfY_00001.flac	tv dot com i'm elaine castady and i play lucye honnychurch in
id10280_IhCiRuNjZfY_00002.flac	lovish um she's quite um yeah experimental im i suppose yeah louciy she comes from a family
id10280_MEa183Zyf5g_00001.flac	john wakefieeld and she has n't gon back to the iland in that time so the only thing that pullsher that brings her back is her friendship for henry there's no way she's gonna miss that wedding so that shows how strong they're
id10280_MEa183Zyf5g_00002.flac	um so she has to to face a lot of a lot of past um issues that she hasn't dealt with that she's kind of run away from
id10280_NXjT3732Ekg_00001.flac	and uh ten' they've got quite a good attention span but
id10280_NXjT3732Ekg_00002.flac	imi i mean i to to be honest i i don't know what to expect i i i i think
id10280_NXjT3732Ekg_00003.flac	pleasan'tly surprised and um you know entertained and
id10280_Np6typH1VKE_00001.flac	think she should know exactly what's going on and where we are in the story
id10280_Np6typH1VKE_00002.flac	to just take each situation as it happens and when people are talking it's like i understand what's going on but lidia doesn't so just to go il don't i don't like when they talk about all this cause it just it confuses me and it reminds me that
id10280_Np6typH1VKE_00003.flac	he'll say you know that he's pleased and that's as far as i'm conserned my ja my job is to please him
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00001.flac	angela robel otherwise known as gelly um she's adolf's half nece cause her mom is his half
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00002.flac	you know if they walked into a restaurant and evryone would stup and star and i think she quite enjoyed that so in the beginning of their relationship um it was a lot of fun a lot of excitement living with her famous unkle you know and coming from a por family so she got
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00003.flac	spending time with that character so um i got to know guelli really well and every day you spent time with her they sond  e freaky but uh so
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00004.flac	just cause she's so full of life and um it was just a real it was just like being aran sunshine every day it was just so refreshing to be rainder but then towards the end of filming am
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00005.flac	we had quite difficult scenes to do um ken and myself and they got quite intense and for the first time ever i i wanted to escape a character
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00006.flac	um you know you you you couldn't just sight read them and just go oh yeah it's
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00007.flac	an easy scene um they had to be quite well worked but um with nick the director who's absolutely brilliant and with ken a just you know we'd block the scene and then because he's just so brilliant it just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time
id10280_PQBBKBYGWgU_00008.flac	so slight and i suppose you could just read it you know once read it one way and then another time read it another way and nick was brilliant cause he pinpointed moments and uh we tried it a few different ways and so in each scene you just you felt
id10280_XiKRlssBw2M_00002.flac	i should be international you know when someone has a story to tell um it's it's universal generally and um it is interesting to think that your voice might be dobed you know and and i i i've i've listened to it before when i was on a plain once and there was a film that i
id10280_XiKRlssBw2M_00003.flac	don an i got to hear myself in a a few different languages which was really impressive but then i realized i couldn't speak those languages so that was kind of um bit of a shame i could always learn the language but it might take too long um but yeah kno i think it's great that you know drama that's made here
id10280_XiKRlssBw2M_00004.flac	and why not let the world see us so to come to this event to show case the great drama that the bbc do cause they've been doing at for hell of a long time and um it's it's great that other countries have the opportunity to purchese it and then
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00001.flac	s known as gelly um she's adolf's half neace cause her mom is his half
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00002.flac	runand would stup and stair and i think she quite enjoyed that so in the beginning of their relationship um it was a lot of fun a lot of excitement living with her famous unkle you know and coming from a por family so she got
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00003.flac	spending time with that character so um i got to know guelli really well and every day you spent time with her they sond o e freaky but u so
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00004.flac	just cause she's so full of life and um it was just a real it was just like being arain sunshine every day it was just so refreshing to be rander but then towards the end of filming um we had quite difficult scenes to do um ken and myself and they got quite intense and for the first time ever i i wanted to escape a character
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00005.flac	um you know you o you couldn't just sight read them and just go oh yeah tit's
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00006.flac	easy scene um they had to be quite well worked but um with nick the director who's absolutely brilliant and with ken a just you know we'd block the scene and then because he's just so brilliant it just the scene would kind of move to another level in such a short space of time
id10280_YcIZDAhexy8_00007.flac	so slight and i suppose you could just read it you know once read it one way and then another time read it another way and nick was brilliant cause he pin pointed moments and uh we tried it a few different ways and so in each scene you just you felt like you were doing a work
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00001.flac	truh john waikefield went on a killing rampage and killed six people and her mom was one of the six so her relationship with her dad
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00002.flac	deminishes and he sends her to la to her grandmothers and um she has
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00003.flac	tried to to get on top of it all and she she has run away from a lot of things you the relationship with her dad she hasn't spoken to thim in all that time so i mean i think it's probably it is maybe
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00004.flac	and how the characters interact and and then how the events kind of turn out and how they react to those events then that kind of
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00005.flac	well yeah that's whern them people can do pools and and decide who they think the killer is and um and why and i mean the amounts of conversations we had because
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00006.flac	well i mean it it you know it deen i think different people will get different things from it and i think they throw a lot of things out there at
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00007.flac	the beginning to make you kind of confused as to to what's going on but um but yeah i mean you know we were just we'd get a script and then we'd be eager for the next one and we're like
id10280_d7S0qeo6EP0_00008.flac	i suppose it's it's most similar to reality shows you know to me cause it was originally um pitched as that and it's um and and and the way it was shot you know everything was
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00001.flac	much about her great grandmother i mean about her mother amd the only kind of rl modle of a woman that she has is ar great grandmother so i think that's why she's a bit that's why she's so niive and inocent and a bit kind of backward
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00002.flac	sh's never kissed a boy and like you know her friends have what she hasn't and it's
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00003.flac	because the only woman she has is two generations older then o're like um and she meets se when she meets johnney
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00004.flac	foo through it's a different story but um so when he goes away she finds out she's pregnant four months later and tells her dad and her dad like he loves her so much but he just he's so anoied that you know it's against her religion and
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00005.flac	oh that's so she kind a feels that she has to go and find johnney to make everything okay and she goes over to brerming ham to find him but it's harder than what she thinks she's
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00006.flac	cause she takes everyone on bacevalue also when she tells them that she's pregnant
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00007.flac	an you know wishing that maybe her father had reacted like that instead so it's kinda like she's seen the bits of her father in um that her father
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00008.flac	he's not bad to you know t i mean he just has his way of bringing her up but
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00009.flac	so then i was kinda getting myself into the frame of mind of her cause she's quite different to me um and
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00010.flac	you know if we're if i had an idea i wanted to change you know just
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00011.flac	you know he'll listen i it's not just like okay thi's the way we're going and we're not changing for anyone you know he'll you're completely openminded and he'll think about it and say okay well actually if he if he disagrees he'll just say like i don think so or if he agrees he might just say oh yeah actually maybe you're right so it's really easy to work with him and as well
id10280_v0Q-VyO4TjI_00012.flac	he wants something more it's lik he'll just say a few key words and then it gets you back on track kind of and he's he's really good
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00001.flac	so it was created by written by staring executive produced by directord son wrote some of the musics all by dennis
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00002.flac	so i play his love interest and his backup singer and
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00003.flac	so he uh back in the day when this was happening there were uh four of us living together three women and dennise's character johnny rock
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00004.flac	fand um then you know now presn't day he has a daughter show up that none of us knew he had and she wants to be famous and we're like yeah right let's j
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00005.flac	has money soh she has money and then it turns out she's actually uber talented
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00006.flac	dennis is so he's such a sport about really just the self deprication ac he loks himself through
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00007.flac	well he he describes it as he created the show based on some guys who who didn't quite make it  you know and thought that that was sort of more interesting and that side of it so theire are
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00008.flac	in the show whose characters did make itnd then but he didn't so it's that uh  you know monday morning armchair
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00009.flac	and even more than that i think it's relatable to anybody who has a family oany
id10281_1CiBWgsHT4E_00010.flac	indyou know as if you're a human you come from some formof dis function and that's really what this show is about is kind of one big

id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00003.flac	could and i know that's not the most  appatizing soundbight here but um
id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00004.flac	it's katie's project and i don't know where things are you know with it i just know that i was one of ceveral experts that she interviewed about um sort of animal rits and and what's happening with them and particularly with um

id10281_NHARUN9OhSo_00007.flac	um i think the best place right now s is to come to me um twitter elane four the number four animals and then my web side elaine hendrik stotpom
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00001.flac	really i wat ma did dennis say because dennis and my character re like we're all about sex but he said
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00002.flac	uh so excited for you to meet them i play ava um johnny rok played by dennis his long time girlfriend and backup singer and we've had a wild wild ride together we've done everything seen everything and then some and um and along the way i have stuck with him no matter how disfunctional he gets and it's just it's real love it's true love um and i do everything i can to
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00003.flac	it was pretty cocast when we were at like erving pals or uh i mean earving place plasa erving plasa um
id10281_R1RQnIQGy10_00004.flac	for you on weekend urbing palaza or the um or the apolo all these
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00001.flac	family and a very disfunctional family but a family and i mean let's face it if you'rea human you understand this function on some level um so i think there's gonna be something in there that everybody can relate to and you know it's
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00002.flac	t'vas that's her thing she committed to the rock and role life that's that's it's
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00003.flac	hrough and through so they are committed to each other uh they've seen everything
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00004.flac	you're gonna get to see that really she wanted a family all these years despite all the  the drugs and the sex and the rockand role um she wanted a family and now she gets to have that when johnney rock has a daughter who shows up that they never knew he had um and then there's also a really fun you know spoiler aleart that i'm not gonna give um a and the very final episode that when i read it when i saw the script
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00005.flac	tracks but then once we got going the guys uh jon corbet already knew how to play the guitar john ailes who plays base he learned how to play the base and then robert kelly who plays drums he learned how to play the drums so by the end of our ten shows for this first season everybody was plyin
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00006.flac	um i just did a lot of research on rock and role i did a lot of research on dru on drugs that like that she probably would have
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00007.flac	done anything other than prescription drugs that i've needed uh for various you know as surgery or you know whatever but um yeah no i i've i've not but i'm very i'm very pro like i'm very pro marrawana actually but yet i've never smoked
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00008.flac	frendship and loyalty and so it's you know uh rescue me which dennis did years ago and had such huge success with it was a one hour drama with camedic elements and now we're doing a half hour comedy with some dramatic elements to it so it it is very very funny
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00009.flac	dennis like we threw it all away he would give us a script and then say come in and he
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00010.flac	sgoing on at all times and so it was  very messy and raw and i think that's what
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00011.flac	tjon jet is coming to our set to do i si and she was awesome like she's just a cool
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00012.flac	and she played herself but like it did involve some acting and sos she was great and she was game and
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00013.flac	most it's dennis leriy i think that's kind of what all of us were drawn to i i mean he's so specific in his style he's so successful and he's just a great guy he's he's a really great guy to work for
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00014.flac	and he over the years is just he's knows a lot of people and he's uh stayed in touch with a lot of people so you you know really kind of it just involves a phonecallum and then if someone's available so
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00015.flac	uhof the show it's it's it it makes a it makes it very specific titake gives it it's on
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00016.flac	dis that uh particularly the the men in the rock industry like choose a look and then they stick with it and so johny rock chose a look and he has stuck
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00017.flac	good all the time and ava has kept it but given it a more modern tuch so uh it's fun because even like there's no off switch with
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00019.flac	like that it just it it doesn't happen ecept for insects and drugs
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00020.flac	good question um first person who popps into my mind who um i get likened to frequently and i take it as a great compliment would be charlies
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00021.flac	wor intimate a little loosely you know i've now intimately worked with them yeah  um
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00022.flac	and lis has said that before and i don't see it i just don't see it and maybe it's because i've worked with them both um
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00023.flac	yeah so i don't know but you know that just e u gus you know in the ey of the
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00025.flac	it's great for animals but it's also great for your health because we're really not built to consume as much meet as we do in modern days so if people knew what was happening to animals if they really knew and if they really absorbed it they would i i believe they would make different choices and  and a lot of it's just getting people
id10281_RDFdX3VxjUQ_00026.flac	on the eating front that people that somehow it tapps into like this um survival in the sfer of so no i i have to eat meet to survive and then it does become a habit like no i i need this and you actually really don't you really really don't you just need protin but that protin does not have to come from animal sources um so yeah and i had another thought but it it went wth
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00001.flac	years ago i made what i call the fortunate mistake of watching an undercover fir video and it
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00002.flac	lyhonored at the national animal wrights conference with their gardion award and also with a tele award for my work on
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00003.flac	it's a funny thing getting an award because it's not really about me it's about the work and i just happen to be the veaic
id10281_UkIpd_3qMak_00004.flac	s dream to murge my work in entertainment ind my work with animals because i believe that we can end animal suffering
id10281_WUg4pRp5_Co_00001.flac	and a lot of like drama inside that comedy which of course is what makes it funny because it's just so absurd and so kind of real and in this crazy dusfunctional world so yeah
id10281_Yw8v8055uPc_00001.flac	an it's just insanity and i think everybody just kind of wants to be a part of that it's like going
id10281_dX8RBKI2FKc_00001.flac	i i my function is really like to help protect him usually from himself but really like he goes off the clif i'm going off
id10281_dX8RBKI2FKc_00002.flac	gillies who plays denies daughter on the show and yeah and everybody's playing live instruments and we we are sex and drugs in rock and rolle
id10281_dX8RBKI2FKc_00003.flac	but i think i'm gonna be here in los angeles i'll be in new york the days before for the premire and press and what not but i think i'm gonna come back here and have just a little
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00001.flac	ause we're so comfortable with each other and i think actually in our own weird way we're we're very much in love so
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00002.flac	yeah in hollywood and um and then that changed it and and i started focusing and acting and now t we'r
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00003.flac	you know i am i like to think of myself anyway as a good happy person who likes to help others and be positive and and so i get to really exercize that shadow side of myself who's not so
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00004.flac	yes well my organization is the pet matchmaker yeah and um we inspire and celebrate rescue fostern adoption of homeless animals
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00005.flac	there's so many um parts to that that were just disturbing from from the aleged killer luring him out of a protended aria to what they did to the to the lian
id10281_eso-dEmfC_c_00006.flac	yessaturday six oclock kiddy bungelo dot
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00001.flac	the motion capture actress for alex wessker and resinent evil revelations two and youwere
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00002.flac	i was hired um for a video game and i actually i didn't even know what the game was and i went in and i had to do all these wardrobe fittings and
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00003.flac	had no idea what the game was and it wasn't until thi
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00004.flac	d fifteen that i started getting messages and started sang immages of aleck's
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00005.flac	three sixty and then they put all these different like probes on me
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00006.flac	have been a big fan of the original and it was i think it's a a really need story i was first introduced to the series when i was filming in australia i was doing a ralt disney movie called in spector cacget twoo there and some castmates and i were just hanging out
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00007.flac	cour seen the movies and and whatnot um but then when the revelations came up i actually haven't played it yet
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00008.flac	i haven't seen it in it's entirety i've been getting all kinds of messages though and um seing fan art um a lot through my
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00009.flac	i think it's really cool to be a part of this franchise and i'ma super super
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00010.flac	uh i thought it was really cool and i think i did a great job of captureing me i've seen
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00011.flac	playing um an evil character playing a a game that involved you know a certain level of violence but again i didn't know what game it was um when they hired me it was all top secret
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00012.flac	so uh they didn't tell me a whole lot um but i just knew that it was gonna be
id10281_ni6gO5jDLJE_00013.flac	thought it was really fascinating i thought it was a lot of fun and the fans have been incredible um i would also love
id10281_o-L8P0xj3qk_00001.flac	thank you um you know i i'm a big believer my acting style is bringin fasicality im was i i'm a classically trained dancer and so
id10281_o-L8P0xj3qk_00002.flac	and so that's just what i i do for every role andt that ends up
id10281_o-L8P0xj3qk_00003.flac	just the type of film that as an actor if i saw on the screen i'd be like
id10281_qBTOwaSOS-M_00001.flac	nearigerto my heart right now is my own animal rescue orgonization  that i'm  founding member of called animal rescue core t'  and uh we do large scop rusues like poppy milles bording dog sled sled dog
id10281_qBTOwaSOS-M_00002.flac	animal rescue organization that i'm a founding member of called animal rescue cor
id10281_qBTOwaSOS-M_00003.flac	that's taking up a lot of time but it's so worth it like i love every single
id10282_37XQxZ5lBD8_00001.flac	it's a very a very real journey i think as well i think that's why people can relate to it because you know they care some
id10282_37XQxZ5lBD8_00002.flac	i think when something is so iconically cornish you know you i wanted to get it right so i spent a lot of time with vo
id10282_CiUT-YF34O4_00001.flac	then everything else is tied in with that you know you've got the sjy on top of it and everything
id10282_CiUT-YF34O4_00002.flac	the simal camshots of giants grabing you ind stuff your bodi's not moving in the right way or if even if the camar is just slightly off thend the whole
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00001.flac	comes back to her roots because she misses her her family and her friends and she's very close to her brother and and then all this kind of
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00002.flac	my house and actually taugt me through it because with it being um fixed skis you know the the peddles keep moving without
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00003.flac	so you can't actually stop so it's terrifying and uh very hard work but gut really good fun and a great challenge so yeah just it a lot of kind of syicaling up and down the sichle chacks neair my house and yeah
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00004.flac	it was very scaryg it was very very scary to be um amongst that and uh to see the you know the lives sta that they live but um at the same time that was kind of was really exciting about it and what i love
id10282_IDA_ElNHLn4_00005.flac	therelationships that you thought were so solid in the first series agana
id10282_OjG2EYFgubs_00001.flac	and standing up to people if if you don't agree with them like not conforming
id10282_Q5fbv-Wyj7k_00001.flac	this being my first kind of big film big break both of them whire just so supportive they were really nice they kind of took me under their wing
id10282_Q5fbv-Wyj7k_00002.flac	iit's a big a big thing for me it's a big thing for everyone but um you know it's my first break i wanted to make a good impression i wanted to do everything everyone in the movie justice and i wanted to do the character justice cause it's not often
id10282_Q5fbv-Wyj7k_00003.flac	that was kind of quite intense but i i loved it i really embraced it
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00001.flac	it'it's amazing that's when you kind of depend on brian to kind of talk you through it and to
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00002.flac	um previs of of what he's planed and what the jiants are looking like what how the how the movement of the scene is gonna play
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00003.flac	mv depends on him following her up the been stark so you know we have to we had to um create a relationship with i
id10282_Tf6tGc30MVM_00004.flac	definite and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with sj in special effects and there's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's a great family movie and i think that people love to kind of go to the cinema with their family and and watch something that everyone can
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00001.flac	um well i think damas is a great character for any actress to take on you know and they're rare those great characters they don't come along that often um but i
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00002.flac	but then to progress into lady of nampara and and a gentleman's wife it's it's such a great
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00003.flac	yes very much so very much so and their relationship is growing the more they get to know each other but there's still turmoil you know
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00004.flac	right after season one um and we've just lost our child so we're dealing with that and ross is going to be tried um
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00005.flac	season two is is very um exciting and upseting and it's a real roler coaster the whole series s
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00006.flac	well i worked very hard with a fabulous voice coach for weeks before filming um because it was so important to me that we got it right you know it's it'
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00007.flac	absolutely love it so we really had to naile that and get that right and i hope i did
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00008.flac	but it's um yeah i think throughout the series as well i wanted e to soffen the
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00009.flac	absolutely so that's been that's been great to to work with i often say that i work very closely with the costume and makeup people to create this realitic look that changes as we get
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00010.flac	e with us all um you know he's such a lovely person he's um i think he's a bit
id10282_U3xR3MZjEVg_00011.flac	to be honest it's just given me so many more opportunities acting wise which is lovely you know it's great t'to be a part of a show that's been such a huge success because it's
id10282_XtwIcZPYN_8_00001.flac	um she'll do absolutely anything for him you know she has quite a few scenes where she triyes to you know save his neck ber
id10282_XtwIcZPYN_8_00002.flac	betting over that and trying to move on with their lives so you know there's a lot of emotion ans exploring the reality of being married and actually how hard that is and i think that's what people love about
id10282_YmJBoCojXf4_00001.flac	really was but um yeah i mean at the same time you've kind of got to contend with the sg and really selling how terrifying these jients are so there is a lot of pressure that comes along with it as well but it was a a great t
id10282_YmJBoCojXf4_00002.flac	tthe prety stuff that they've shot with you know um or the
id10282_YmJBoCojXf4_00003.flac	the stuff that they've shot with uh bill ni already and obviously his stuff was played back to ursonor the motion capture
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00001.flac	her rots back to ur her family to her brother and um yeah back to back to the life that she left of being a courie
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00002.flac	out to be perfectly honest with yo i'm not entirely sure it's me  i' i'
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00003.flac	a different side to me that i've been wanting to kind of express for a while so um so it was it was great and immediately i was grabed by the project something really different something icod really throwing myself into so
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00004.flac	with curiers uh real curieers um during filming and an it was really interesting to actually
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00005.flac	to speak to them and i think they're you would expect thet to be much more accidents than theyre are but
id10282_Zbz058o9j6s_00006.flac	realistic film and i think i think we've managed to grab that you certainly get
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00001.flac	young and she's passionate and she's was born into the roal family she didn't choose the life that comes with it so
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00002.flac	and have her own experiences before she takes on that responsibility you know she doesn't just want to
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00003.flac	's got an an incredible vision and he's he's great at kind of sharing that with you you know when someone is that kind of inspired it's it's amazing to kind of you really feel that andi it gives you hope and it it makes you trust them so that you know that you're in
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00004.flac	the the best time working on this i mean it was such an experience a roller poaster from day
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00005.flac	just any tom dick and harry or roger or you know it's it's ahead it's lead by brian's
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00006.flac	the the movie that we've we've all achieved together you know we became a a real team and i think that we have we have something that's really cool and hopefully we'll be a great film that will be part of a familiy's life you know either for young kids or or adults there is something
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00007.flac	like that it's fantastic you know we did a lot of training for the role so uh we we wanted to be able to do our own stunts to do justice to our characters because that's that's part of the twist particularly for isabel is that she is fisti and she's she is searching for adventure so she throwes herself at everything so i loved all of the action i mean obviously interacting with jiants and being put in the harnesses so it made it look like the gieant had a hold o yie was was incredible and then you're turn upside down and throwing around i remember my mum came to seand she was
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00008.flac	i found the scene at the beginning in jack's house really challenging because even the dialoge in that scene as well kind of creating that relationship between jack and isabel that is so crucial to the movie and you only have one scene to do it in because in the next minute she's taken up the been stark so kind of creating a chemistry between the two of them that was believable that he would then clime this beene stork to rescue her was was a challenge and then also when the beens stork ard rupds through the floore that making that kind of look realistic was was was
id10282_ek_uqADnhPQ_00009.flac	reading fairytales at night is not i hope it's not a dying breed by any means but now with you knowuum tv film ipads whatever there is something in a child's
id10282_hgB5ziAudzU_00001.flac	pick up sensitively from where you left off and rossin's being tried so
id10282_hgB5ziAudzU_00002.flac	to deal with but i think the main thing is real life marriage and this other woman that just were
id10282_nYsLbFOQfOI_00001.flac	yeah i did um i'm not sure why but i just thought it would
id10282_nYsLbFOQfOI_00002.flac	and being the hero that uh ross pollduck is he managed to
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00001.flac	yeah well it's actually really interesting cause last time we were here the show hadn't aired his and no one really knew what it was so i'm kind of excited you know to see what people's reaction was to the first
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00002.flac	um well the great thing about season two is that our characters are very much already established so it's basically working on the relationships that you feel as so solid in
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00004.flac	sfiercely protective of her man and um she'll do absolutely anything for him you know she there's quite a few scenes where she tries to you know save his neck basically because he's
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00005.flac	hhe stands up for what he believes in and and doesn't necussarily think about the consequences off that and how terrifying that it's
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00006.flac	uh i'm halfway through book six so yeah cause we do two books at a time and i
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00007.flac	yeah i think i think at the heart of it you know it's the story of an underdogu it's a story of a real romance and you know you have these incredibly relatable characters at the heart of it i think that's what people love about it and um you know it was such a huge success before so you know doing a new aduptation of it i was incredibly scary because obviously you wanted d to be as good as the
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00008.flac	it's um it's been it's been really nice i meand i think the the thing to remember is that it is different from the previous
id10282_neQO6_CUY4w_00009.flac	and it's you know it's a new adaptation of the books and um and that's been really cool you know it's lovely to have
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00001.flac	um well i think damas is a great character for any actress to take on you know and they're reare those great characters  they don't come along that often um but i
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00002.flac	but then to progress into lady of nampara and and a gentleman's wife it's it's such a
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00003.flac	yes very much so very much so and their relationship is growing the more they get to know each other but there's still turmoil you know
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00004.flac	right after season one um and we've just lost our child so we're dealing with that and ross is going to be tried um
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00005.flac	se two is is very um exciting and upsetting and it's a real rolar coaster the whole series
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00006.flac	well i worked very hard with a fabulous voice coach for weeks before filming um because it was so important to me that we got it right you know it's it'
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00007.flac	just but it's um yeah i think throughout the series as well i wanted o to soffen the
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00008.flac	absolutely so that's been that's been great to to work with i often say that i work very closely with the costume and makeup people to create this realistic look that changes as we get older
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00009.flac	e with is all um you know he's such a lovely person he's um i think he's a bit
id10282_qkZNuvX1UNo_00010.flac	to be honest it's just given me so many more opportunities actingwise which is lovely you know it's great to be a part of a show that's been such a huge success because it's
id10282_rC63HnQ3Nf8_00001.flac	it really was but um yeah i mean at the same time you've kind of got to contend with the cg and really selling how terrifying these jiants are so there is a lot of pressure that comes along with it as well
id10282_rC63HnQ3Nf8_00002.flac	the stuff that they've shot with uh bill ni already and obviously his stuff whas played back to erson or the motion capture
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00001.flac	hard work but yeah i mean it's it's amazing that's when you kind of depend on brian to kind of talk you through it and to show you um previs of of what he's planed and what the jiants are looking like what howthe how the movement of the scene is gonna play out
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00002.flac	so you know we have to we had to um create a relationship
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00003.flac	asen right the beginning of the film so that was kind of you know that was very difficult and it took us quite a while to kind of find the right balanc
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00004.flac	definite and it's always exciting now to see where they can go with cjg in special effects and there's so much now that they couldn't do back in the day so that's that's always enticing for audiences and it's a
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00005.flac	witthis being my first kind of big film big break both of them were just so supportive they were really nice they kind of took me under their wing and and made sure that i was okay and that's that's
id10282_s4X9cwCCnFo_00006.flac	you know this is a big a big thing for me it's a big thing for everyone but um you know it's my first break i wanted to make a good impression i wanted to do everything everyone in the movie justice and i wanted to do the character
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00001.flac	well it was a sort of long process really and i went for my first audition and i just read the
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00002.flac	like a series of auditions after that and then a series of workshops and then they offered me the part so it was a long process but it was thrilling and sort of the adrenaline you get from it and it's it's is i
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00003.flac	i mean making this movie was so much fun i mean i loved absolutely every
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00004.flac	um anything really i mean just anything that's classy and that i know that i'm really gonna enjoy something
id10282_zGjY8J48FoE_00005.flac	really get stuck into itd i'd quite like to do like an action film which has a bit of sord fighting or something in it just something that i've not experienced yet
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00001.flac	really great position where i could kind of pick and choose what i wanted and i started getting offers to do a lot of and a big studio movies and none of the scripts excited me and i just started looking at different things in the world that were disturbing me and i'd seen this websight where you could go to tiland and pay ten thousand dollars to walk into a room and shoot somebody in the head and that idea disturbd me
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00002.flac	meso much i said through this i'm just gonna writ direct produce do my own movie have complete you know creative
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00003.flac	and after he saw the movie he invited me to his house to watche movies and uh i think we were watching borthegar gancshos r hellnight or some old film and uh we started talking about difern
id10283_52SYuI0cCbQ_00004.flac	you've gotta rite that right now so i just ran home unpluged my phone shot off my
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00001.flac	yeah it was great i mean i grew up in boston and there's a certain type of guy from boston we call
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00002.flac	nd thegi drink the fidy and you know i went jo i live with those guys and i got beat up by those guyis i kinda was one of those guys so a lot of the times you know when you're on set you cauld kinda act like that and be like dood
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00003.flac	but quentin londo i mean brad was aldo and i was donny the merg the whole time and there was a pm carline i was like cola
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00004.flac	had these guys in my head for eight years and now i get to hang out with them this is so cool so but you know the beating scenes it was very cathortic to get that out of your system but you know the truth is that when i'm filming a death scene i get happier and happier as the day goes on as i'm getting my shot
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00005.flac	conjere up the most painful darkest stuff from your entire life and bring it right to the cerfhice like it just happened ten minutes ago so i noticed at the end of the day i was just drained i didn't wanna talk to anybody you just wanted to crall into a whole and dye and then you get up and do it again the next day so certain days were fun but on the days when i had to kill somebody it was really really much more intense
id10283_GcHWzqveqyc_00006.flac	thing that you were never supposed to do but you know there was a real purpous to it i mean this wasn't for shock this was and you know and we were shooting going okay this has to hang with in glorious bastard so i gotta bring it as
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00002.flac	facebook maybe thes social media but you know if you're you know fourteen fifteen sixteen or youre early twenties and you've grown up with that you know all these different tricks you're the your whole mentality of how to use social media um and how to use a phone it's
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00003.flac	you know it's completely different and what's terrifying to me to someone in their fourties that there is nothing private anymore you know thre's a whole generation that's grown up with no concept of privasy they're they're
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00004.flac	tescoping but we grew up in this era where kind of oli our behavior for me before it
id10283_H4mDLFeGpLU_00005.flac	it's not recorded thank god so um i wanted to show what can happen that i what terrifies me is the idea that you know in the time of fatal attraction you could do something like this maybe your wife found out maybe youre people at work but now if you mis behave you cheat on your wife you do something wrong it caul literally be broadcast to the whole
id10283_Ma_3RlzPUOM_00001.flac	together i go well we really need to start prep in a week he's like what i go yeah we have this house and these people who oved out and we have all this arn spek because are you twoo an saying were
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00001.flac	it was a commination of several events one i was watching the old seventys cannable films
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00002.flac	never make that movie today because the jungle is't like there anymore you w it's gone it's all dissapearig ad thought okay that's my end it's like it's not
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00003.flac	to protect the jungle to stop you know the uncontacted tribes but at the same time occupyed wall street was happening and during ocupyed wallstreet there was a relative of mine who was ocupying and i rembr he graduated college and it was like oh is he working what's he's doing and my mom was like oh know he's occupying and i was like well what's he ocupying against i mean he hasn't really been screwed over by anybody he like gew up in a nice family and went to college and like well he goes with his friends they meet girls you know that's lik yo and i just thought okay are i great
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00005.flac	o no deril subara when he's like pkeing and there's a tirancial hat's a real poisonous tiranciuala that's froling mime so everybody in the cast fully fully went for it and i think that's one of the reasons the movie really works when you see them they're in the the dirt and they're surrounded by pig shit and they're etting bittn by buges there's no makeup there
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00006.flac	ams like we had to send cast members to the hospital we had to take get yellow fever shots we had anty molarea pilles we had to get deparacited after we
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00007.flac	amazone it was crazy when the girls when the kids drop a snake on curbe in magna's face that is a real snake that was i was standing there and the kids turne around they're like the they're lke oh the kids have have an idea and they had a baby python and thu i was like what do they want they go will the the kids thought it be funny if we threuw it in the cage with the with you know the americans and i was like actually tat's a great idea we're gonna do that and so we did the take
id10283_N69Hp2DGMLk_00008.flac	and i look at the if you freese frame it the the thing's like two inches from biting your face so it was just that kind of a shoot but you know what
id10283_QitLqlca660_00001.flac	uand i you know he told me the story and i said i will do anything to help you make this movie we write the screen play and bring it to our partners erick neman and mark abraham who 're fantastic producers and you know madeu lot of great movies and then we take it to universal with that team and then we bring on buill congand then corwen comes on for the fights and it's just snowball som he
id10283_QitLqlca660_00002.flac	y'e not just seeing another fight you're moving the story forward but you're really unfolding another corner of this world with oh wow okay that's the roads okay these guys go underground that's really cool okay thesere the falcons they live in the trees and th you know it's jungle village we wanted to really create
id10283_QitLqlca660_00003.flac	univers and that's what we spent a year and a half in the writing thinking of every clan thinking of their wepon thinking of what their relationship is with other clans so that you know their
id10283_QitLqlca660_00004.flac	you know also the rythm the rhythm of the dialoc manth there was a lot but you know it's it really uh kindof harnessing what he did with wootang he really was able to produce all of that and really bring in da batsta and russel crow and cona west and wis califa an crbela all these people from all these different worlds um you know everybody coming together and
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00001.flac	movies and that's okay cause to me it was always make believe and pretend and i always thought no matter what i'm doing on a movie set there's nothing worse than what's going on in the real world i mean people
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00002.flac	and he said oh they're just pigines a's like these are creatures these are animals and i actually remember m the guilthypping
id10283_S-dgypZHvhg_00003.flac	i couldn't i couldn't be in ta house anywhere i couldn't be friends with this person knowing that these people left their dog out there suffering and and they had this attitude wo it's just a dog but you could see how upset this animal was so i had very i'm always very very affected by violence in real life and certainly violence against

id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00006.flac	it's exactly what you would do it's like this dream that you had and you realize that somebody else had that same dream and now you're sharing it with all these other people
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00007.flac	i'm sorry but that ws one of the best screens i it felt like the energy of the red carpet of can was in that room it was i've never been in a screen like that it was like electric
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00008.flac	trdynigh he had a movie night i mean leading off to it he showed the good the bad and the uglye show the durthe doesn't he
id10283_SwMoq9ZHxpw_00009.flac	with like it's rod taylo and shim around on this bar firing into a croud and when he said the ending he's like darker the sun
id10283_arklnCzCq48_00001.flac	the business is changing to such a degree that you're finding that movies are kind of small viod realieces or it's marvel and clearly what audiences are going to and what theaters are booking are star war's movies and these kind of event super hero films so uh it's certainly there's a lot of fun you get a lot of mhoney to play with i mean they don't they don't
id10283_arklnCzCq48_00002.flac	it's interesting it's uh it's a whole other universe that's happening right now
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00001.flac	i first had the idea to write and direct cannabal hollicost
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00002.flac	believe what i had just seen and it was before the internet so i couldn't just go up and look up information and i tried to find it in every book and i was i
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00003.flac	actually killed people and i studied special effects i h'd seen every makeup affects but i had never seen anything so effective the filmmaking the documentary style and of course the s ortolane music um and that was what began my obsesion with the movie and of course reading about ragero and subsequently realizing that he had directed other movies that i loved as well um but it seemed like he really murdered
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00004.flac	every review ever by anyone the
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00005.flac	thy talk about is kennabl holycost kennabl hollycost and the hollywood
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00006.flac	become over time the gold standard for like it's like the ultimate outlaw har movie there's nothing there is no
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00007.flac	was going to work and to really start the movie i was paying myself or my own money to fly the crew to go to paru and while we were there like right before shooting was when the financing came together but i had to say yes we're going yes we're going we were fighting the weather and then we were in the jungle and i started production and every day i was thinking i i really today i really need to write rosero we're
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00008.flac	tell him right when i get back in desember but by then the news had gotten out and i felt i felt terribly that you didn't hear it from me first
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00009.flac	cannabl hollicost is the inspiration and it's a very different type of story and the name o the green infirno but the idea was i want
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00010.flac	that's kindo ude mamondo kannibalie has the finger thing that you'll see tomorrow night  amonst other things but um
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00011.flac	really for a modern american audiences we cause  it couldn't be as strong as canabel hollycost it's a different story but i want you notice in the credits i
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00012.flac	world and uh canabl holicost i want people that maybe have never seen it that are too scared to see it to watch green infirno and then go find cannabl hollycost if they haven't
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00013.flac	i i like fiscoraldo i like the scenes with the natives when the natives come on the wod i think
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00014.flac	but the one were we shot is by agiry the rath of god cause they call it the pogo agera and we went
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00015.flac	but the difference but also a margo for my
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00016.flac	i the difference obviously very i think that what makes cannabal holicost unique that a lot of people don't know is that you are the everybody knows youare the assistant director to roberto rosaline but not many people know that you are the
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00017.flac	is writing crime novels and detective stories now and his crime films are incredible i mean you made great crime films as well but when we think of lenze i think of the italian crime and if you look at cannabl ferock
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00018.flac	and in cannabel farroks they're finding a det it's more it's the keep cutting back to new york
id10283_clznvDi-ybg_00019.flac	back to these police but lenziy loves the detective story so i think that instead of
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00001.flac	every single day uh there was no electricity no running watter these people had not only never seen a
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00002.flac	there were poisonous snakes and terancales it was the amosone it was no joke it was it was scary at times but uh i'm glad we pushed it and did it and
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00003.flac	thats maki me a better director it's actually much easier to direct uh you know at forty than at thirty and i feel
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00004.flac	lots of reports of it when we were in paru too crazy stories it was insane and once we were in the jungle we realized it's a thousand stories there it's uh it's an amazing place i mean w you know canabalism it's it's the last unthinkable thing
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00005.flac	they were awesome i mean theye were villagers they weren't like people that you'd expect like they weren't like canabal holycoust er they'reactually people that live in
id10283_cmG1DiHm-fM_00006.flac	parts into parue because people actually shit ship real body parts so we had we had fake heads and fake arms and all that stuff got comfascated by custemes and even thoug i w'sfake can me explain it was a movie it was very hard like it was it was a
id10283_eC9ZIOvohds_00001.flac	f when is terantino directing me i could i could turn off that directing hat i mean when when you're going in as an actor you know what you're getting into and i said i wanted to be the dream actor i wish i had i just fully through myself into the part i put on almost forty pounds of mussld i went back to boston where i grew up and only talked o my accent and created the role and created the character and uh you know i just became posesed by really really giving him
id10283_eC9ZIOvohds_00002.flac	sa as long as you dnont mentione eighty six it's fun but the truth is we get mad about the mets in eighty six but the painefl things were more mad at bob stanly and calven sherralde you know i i i can't hate the mets the way i hate the yankies i just can't
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00001.flac	but a bunch of kids who get a cabin in the woods they go there to have fun and they get this flesh eating disease which wrips through their flesh and does horrible things and they go crazy and
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00002.flac	movie that was both funny and skary where like in the style of american we're off in london or evil dead two where you're laughing one minut and just so disgusted you're laughing the next and
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00003.flac	you're trap somewhere in the woods and it's like your friend turns into the flesh eating monster only this time it's this real disease
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00004.flac	fifty million dollars so when you're making a movie on that low budget you gotta find you know youe gotta be creative you gotta push the gor
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00005.flac	find you know youe gotta be creative you gotto push the gor push the scares be totally politically incorrect really making its shocking and violant
id10283_gAKHqHbNt2g_00006.flac	history of human nature when people get lepera sy they're sent to lepor colones smallpox they're put in isolation and two years ago when the stars outbreak hit china what did they do they seeled those people off they didn't take them to the hospital cause nobody knew what this was and nobody wanted to get it they seeled those people in a building until they figured out what the hell it was and i think that the kids aren't monsters i think that they're just behaving the way kidswod behave and that's one of the things that's made the film i think such a success in america is

id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00001.flac	scraven was one of those names that as you got older his films grew with you so when i was a kid it was before vcar so
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00002.flac	was a film that your friend's older brother saw so you'd have them going oh that's a movie and they take the girl
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00004.flac	rening of last house in the left and it has this kind of harry nillson foky music done by david alexander hest in remember thinking like god this is nineteen seventy two and this is two thousand two you couldn't use this music in a movie today and i thought that's it i'm i'm gonna do it i'm gonna track down that music and so i took six songs from last house in the left and i got the guy who plays the killer who sings these songs it was his kids did a cover for the endd cred it's it was something super super giky and it
id10283_p3q7Z0O6rgg_00005.flac	m and he saw he heard the last house and left music and i was like oh my god this guy's the real deal and i met west and i was like uh high nice to meet you sorry i stole six times from your movie
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00001.flac	uh about five or six years ago this trailer showed up around halowene uh for a movie called clown where guy puts on a clown suot for his kid's birthday part and he can't take it off and he starts turning into this monster and the hair he keeps cutting the hair and it growes back and he rips the nose feeses in and then it's a
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00003.flac	its youknow even though he hadn't done a feature his commerials and videos were so smart they he was part of this collective smuggler films and his his stuff just looked amazing everything he did had that real beautiful clean pollish um and i just knew if he applied that esthetic to a horror film he'd make something really special his second film copcar is fantastic
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00004.flac	ut it was it was a pleasure it's it's it's nice when you work with a director like john it's the same experience i had with tywest making the sacrament or doniel stand doing last exercism where you can just really be there as support but just
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00005.flac	grim's fairytales going back hundreds of years i mean those are the oldest horris stories there are and there's a reason we've been telling them for
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00006.flac	eaten by witches and eaten by trols so um when you're dealling with clowns i think what makes clown's
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00007.flac	s that they are around children and that we do let them around children and that when we as children we're so fascinated by them that you think oh my gosh this is a grown man that we let around kids just because they have clown makeup on and then
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00008.flac	someone could you know use that to do horrible things to children so i think that's where clown started to get a bad names being creepy and there hadn't really been a horro film in a while that explored that and i i think that what john came up with that was so clever is the idea that it's not the
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00009.flac	eas evil it's the suit that's evil that when once whoever puts this on is gonna transform into this thing and in that way it really becomes much more like the fly and that's what i thought was was brilliant was their way in to tell this story that it's not just okay clons or scary let's make a scary movie but what if you were just a dad trying to do the right thing to help your kid and you dressed up like a clown because the clown you wanted didn't show up to the birthday party and you just put on the wrong clown suiot
id10283_p5g1heXp34o_00010.flac	you really feel for this guy as he's trying to resist the urge but um you know we wanted to stay true to the fairy taile mythology and that's whye we made a movie that was you know probably
id10283_r9-0pljhZqs_00001.flac	good hard thereis uh you wanna have some sort of message underneath it i never like to go to the movies and have a history lesson forced down my throt but i love when i'm watching gory movies over and over and watching people's heads be wripped off and guts get torn out and then you realize that the d

id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00003.flac	exactly well that's the whole idea is that i wanted to use the camera work to tell the story and to show character and there's three kind of moves through the house where we take our time going through the first time is just introducing everything the second time is at night and the third time is t the end hene it's just completely
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00005.flac	big moment here um and it was just such a pleasure to work with cuono reves and uh you know find incredible incredible talent like ona dearmis and give her her english language break she amazing amazing
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00006.flac	yeah i nlook i mean therere movies like the strangers and funny games that i i really like but uh one of the things that struck me about peter trainer's death game which calling camp was in in nineteen seventy five it's very very little seine film it really kind of a a master piece um is the the way these girls show up the theres just the premos of two girls showing up at your house and cheating on your wife and then they won't leave and it really unravels your life and what happens when you lose control
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00007.flac	kono lets the vampire nd you know in faital attraction dan makes the mistake you know i won't be ignored dan like it's dan's fault and that's what's gary thy yo know th whether it's  hard candy or even polanskie's death in the madon does a great job that was  that was a big
id10283_u3s9xdUlmmk_00009.flac	on apsr also i'm forty three and the way i would use social media face bock or twitter anythings is completely different than the way a seventeen
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00001.flac	and i remember the iselanders were like di you yor the american doesn' know how to shave lik they're looking at mea they's come out
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00002.flac	e in a foren country it can be scary going to hospital especially when you walk into the doctor's office
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00003.flac	so finally she like she goes can i have a sample of it and i went sure
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00004.flac	and they w like gave it was some crazy ringworm infection that i got and
id10283_uA1E_38TuTw_00005.flac	it was uh that's what inspired the movie i thought wel you can be totally healthy and
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00001.flac	fans when you're when you create a new show it's not like watching
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00002.flac	brasing it d loving it and the show is wildly successful and hopefully a
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00003.flac	r argentina shelie the fans are the same they love it and it's really great when you can get
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00004.flac	scary story set in that world youknow every country has their own monster
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00005.flac	ery country has it's own you know the the gost nd jepani jepan witrh the girls and the the well the haire
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00006.flac	every country has their own horror stories and people love it when you can take a classic like the vampire where wel frank and sine the monsters and reinvent them in an interesting way and that's what we thought prima grevie really did with his novel himlock grove and we wanted to create a series that felt something like an more of the style of david linch twin kes but almost with a touch of dougglas serk melo drama but something that was spooky and stialized intelligent and fun and it was really great
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00007.flac	of hemlock grove people really people are fascinated with small town of
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00008.flac	american life and we've created we worked very hard to create a universe that is something special and unique and of
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00009.flac	you're significant other it's like a serious offense in ta relationship um but no it was it was instrumental in the i reer in season one when they we talked about all thirteen episodes going on at once it really changed the way we could write the shop we did't have to writ for commersial braks we didn't have to do recaps
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00010.flac	it's you're right there in your home you're with your friends you put it on you watch another one and another one and we knew that uh you know one of the
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00011.flac	like we loved brian man grevie's novel and the first season we were fitting thirteen episodes to that novel so there were times you could feel wher we were streatching we felt in watching it after kai could feel this when we streatched it a little bit to get to this story
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00012.flac	deep delpt much deeper into her character but cause she's such she's such an incredible actor with such amazing range we want it to show all the different layers
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00013.flac	of olivia and we we fitted to ten episodes so that everything was story story story but we wrote it knowing that people in general are watching tor
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00014.flac	thir series of ten and sort of streching having those huge moments like the transformation obviously we want the
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00015.flac	turns back into a human we what does that look like we gotta see what that looks like and spenceers
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00016.flac	we we realized that at ten episodes we were just a little more focused and we could really make each episode like let's focus on making ten amazing amazing
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00017.flac	episodes and really putting really writing those huge kind of big set pieces that por people calle oh my god i cant i've never seen that done before um and  everyone it was just a little more managabl itwas a little mor
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00018.flac	thirteen worked for the book but now that we were um you know creating
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00019.flac	on our own without the buok we thought that ten would be really you know let's make ten really really
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00020.flac	yeahi mean shick work under james cameran a dark angel like the guy he's he's worked with so he's such an amazing range of experience working with such great producers
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00021.flac	creators um that what was really nice was we had you know we had the book last year we had
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00022.flac	amazing to you last even but it did feel like we we didn't have that one so the book was the central voice and we needed one person that could really be the central voice and the filter for all their ideas cause i'm gonna have a million ideas but i also don't i
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00023.flac	my preasence i can't just show ut be like hey guys what if we do this like i need to we we all agreed the best way to work was to everyone kind of filters everything through chick and you know i could say what if like
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00024.flac	t like i remr saying to him i was like what if we what if like i want to see what happens to peter he's been so careful about being a of vargolf like andand thout beng about being aware of like and just and where he can transform and it's such a secretive thing that he would only like roman sis like what if at the beginning of th seconde season he's just doing it to a bunch of strangers and we realized just how completely far gon he is and how he just doesn't ave  fuck about anything and chicks like and i was like what if he's doing it like just fock woth some people and and and chicks like no mandhe shou like he's i was like what if he's doing it like
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00025.flac	aking them think they're holucinating and thinkin it was drugs and chicks like yeah you should be doing tis a grift we're like that's it like it's like t's like a drug deale we're using it to like trick people into thinking they're holucinating to sell drugs to get sel bake drugs to get money like and that's what we loved about chick was we could say what happens to you when you're you have
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00026.flac	pability and you force it against the wrong moode how does that start to make you go and sayn what does that reak havic
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00027.flac	how it was really a metefor for being self destructive and going on some kind of crazy drug bench you're not supposed to do um but the i but then se
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00028.flac	understood how to take that idea and immediately incorporate it
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00029.flac	that you understand why he's doing it like and that's what's great about someone like chick is he could take any crazy idea we threwh at him and really understand how to turn it into story and turn it into character base story i il like think visually  think of ideas thin of characters this or that and you know fomp is obviously she's a you know a director and a creator and writor and we all have ideas
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00030.flac	but chick is uh is so experienced and cool and
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00031.flac	love and he's hewas a great adition to the sh he has his own ideas as well so it just it just became one central
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00032.flac	and how the network made david linch and mar frost saeropolish murder and the frustration it lead to an the
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00033.flac	really about the people in the town and then they saw the murder and they had to come up with winda merl a new you knovillan and the black log which a ihd storyline i love but you could tell
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00034.flac	we explain its an efos we talkd about a three season you know three to five season macro ars of whe're where the characters are
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00035.flac	weu but after the first season we sat tow and we looked at those america arts i think this is where
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00036.flac	we had you know sort of a multi season plan for where the characters were going
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00037.flac	were we're going to go and then we brought in chick who's like completely fresh set of eyes who just watched it as a fan he's like i love the show but here's where id take it and suddenly yhou were like oh my god that's actually an an amazing idea so tit was a combination of sort of of knowing the macro ark of where we were going to go but also seeing what worked and we're like everybody loves the guys her when you see romand and peter to
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00038.flac	oi ran it t id t was like what's good please tell me shelly isn't dead like shellie's
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00039.flac	lie you could see there are a lot of people that have that in introspective poetic sense ind its
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00040.flac	well there were ideas i mean brian macrevy had a idea we wanted t to almost we're gonna do a grafhic novel of a bridge between season one and season two and there were there were ie still
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00041.flac	some kind of grahic novl or something you know it's it's a whole univers that we love that we'd love to keep expanding on
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00042.flac	um but it's really up to the fans you know  fans give it can stick of the show and gives season to a chance inti only allows allows us the opportunity to firther explore it in many
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00043.flac	certain forces there's a reason everyone is coming to hemlon grote and there's a much bigger picture at play as to why this town is becoming the the for text for all this particular type of
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00044.flac	i mean it's something you know we we want to lay the groundwork for a show that can go for many seasons and explore many
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00045.flac	that loses its potancy  apon repeted viewings you know if you watch a comedy thet
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00046.flac	with horror the very thing you go for is that scare and that's the thing once you know it's coming it's never as strong tha second time so when you create a show you have to make so much more than that it can't be about the scare it's gotta be about the characters and the story the intrigue the universe the world and those great moments and those great lines and the things they do and the way they dress and the way you know it's such this
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00047.flac	you know we we wan i wev we're we're laying the groundwork for a really really rich universe that we wanto explore in two hundred different directions but it's really uh up to the fans at this point if people continue
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00048.flac	no uh you know we we love the fan reaction um but the fan reaction generally informs what that
id10283_vaK4t1-WD4M_00049.flac	ti to the lon of us he had this characters in his head for eight years before the show so now the fact that everyone else is they're a part of that universal creator he loves
id10283_vv4mvANXHcs_00002.flac	those are the people i wantnta see crash in the jungle and just get eaten because from the point of viewof the villagers they're just invadors they just see them as people dressd in construction suits taring up their land and they've crash in their back yard they're gonna punish them like invadors so that's what's fun for me is the clash of
id10283_vv4mvANXHcs_00003.flac	wis whye you work i mean the village had to be a real functioning village and we found this amazing village in peoo and the whole village got in on the making the movie and they loved it it was it was so much fun a lot we had to conceptually explain to this village what a movie was they'e so cut off with no electricity many of them had never seen a television before let alon a

id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00013.flac	plans out something and you as the actor have to obay everything he wrote he wrote we spent years with tenec
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00014.flac	no i think i think therere a lot of good playwrights today but the theater has
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00015.flac	off broadway off broadway but the united states is rich in tiny theaters all across the

id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00023.flac	the actor is is the one who brings back to life what the playwriter ha's written
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00024.flac	orchestra player so i bring to life what the writer has written and the director has created with the author i am just
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00025.flac	the the best good actor i've ever met nown and i said what do you mean good why not great why not
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00026.flac	pa part for the course  be a mother a wife have children but the other part the talent part the actor

id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00028.flac	i'm going and she'd walk out and i knew then she'd lay out the the food for me to eat but that i was in my glory

id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00033.flac	b an actor doesn't mean i'm a second class citisin i have to be a participant in the society so
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00034.flac	felt it was a society that protected the idea and the thoughts
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00035.flac	your hair stands up on the back of your neck when you when you read what he what he wrote and all of it when
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00036.flac	strinberg ibson all of them are very very generous in exploring the inner thoughts of what's to appear on a stage and we're lucky to have had them
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00037.flac	keep thinking now you have tenece williams you have arther miller
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00038.flac	it it reminds me of puantelism you put
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00039.flac	art and you step aside step back and the youe hov
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00040.flac	it's always fun for me to indulge in that mysterieos
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00041.flac	as an italian did research on te civil war that was rarly done an american film
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00042.flac	clinise would bless him began to do and anelize just what leoney did the clothing they ware the way they they walked the way they wrode all of that is a part of our
id10284_7yx9A0yzLYk_00043.flac	i'm lucky to have shared in it i spent three and a half months in the jungles in cambodia in uncal wat part of the the yunited states was preparing to go to ewar in vetnam and i'm making movies uh based on a book by
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00001.flac	that the first imprint you make on film stays with you the rest of your film career the first film i did was called baby do and i was rathera
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00002.flac	i don't think there's anything more violeant than what's happening in the world todayuh you talk about films let's talk about the attack in the subways let's talk about vtnam let's talk about angola bay
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00003.flac	you see so that you can't blame the movies or television for
id10284_EoCPhxtWUOc_00004.flac	i don't know whether whether it's an exorcism whether it's a cathocis by seeing violence in a movie uh some people try to emulate what's in a movie a barma may see something in a movie and decide the'll go bam something you see so i think there should be less violence there should be more
id10284_O_rxcwBWTz4_00001.flac	i don't know why doesn't leony do that with me t a lot of the times i was angry why didn't i just
id10284_O_rxcwBWTz4_00002.flac	only do that with me t a lot of the times i was angry why didn't i just
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00001.flac	conrad's lod gim and each morning i'd go to have a bol of sup with a
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00002.flac	cambodian man who ran a little stand at sort of nedis and he used to smile at me we spoke nothing together you know but he'd smile at me because i was
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00003.flac	ti think making films used to be an expression join the nave and see the world it's now join the movies and you' see
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00004.flac	no but i i have a feeling that there's some affinity you know if if you think of um what's what's the word  where you're reserected where youe come back as someone else what is that word
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00005.flac	s uh but um of course the first formative years of
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00006.flac	feeling and and i wanted to channele it somehow i didn't know i used to ly on my bed and pretend it was the sahara and i was in the forren leagen and i'd get shot in the arm and my mother would come in and say it's time to eat and i'd say i'm bleading i'm bleading you see i was acting constantly acting who
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00007.flac	fire torturing peter otol in the cambodian jungle somewhere and here it is my dream
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00008.flac	i thought wel danit the play's just started why isn't he paying any
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00009.flac	butand this monaologu goes on as you're doing the play i said well maybe he doesn't like me then i the other part of me says the id part says but he paied his money he's got a perfect
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00010.flac	m we didn't do what the lunc did who after a few years of marriage or u shortly after they married sed made a pack and said we will never appear
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00011.flac	toward the end of their lives they began to appear separately we've not had any rul of thum
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00012.flac	uh if some wonderful opportunity comes up for an in a film or a play she's certainly welcome to do it i mean in the last few years she did a play called inquest
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00014.flac	the actor has been worried about the economic aspects you see england they he becomes so
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00015.flac	litt red thing and he's the leagen of honer in russia he's an honored artist of this soviet union and
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00016.flac	i would say the the best thing that can happen in america and more and more the big companies are finding it out they're devoting certain of their funds into the arts because you must u people must have more than just the
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00017.flac	for yeast for the mind you see a good play not only entertains and amuses you
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00018.flac	yes it does i mean there's nothing better more clenszing than a good cry
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00019.flac	in having had a diverse career and moved from media to media
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00020.flac	uh loving to to as the farmor does plow up his soile every every few years jump from a television show into a play into a movie in that way you become
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00021.flac	movie i was on the stage in tehouse of the augost moon playing an
id10284_RNYNkXzY5Hk_00022.flac	and casan came to me and offered me a part in a movie called baby dol written by tenne williams
id10284_Rzpm9hlXV6I_00001.flac	teacher of of acting has developed their own method they've ecxcepted what it came from originally stanislovsky in rush
id10284_Rzpm9hlXV6I_00002.flac	loved him there was no pressure there was no histerics it was a love
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00001.flac	the next performance i didn't get the laugh which taught me a valuble lesson that you don't do it yourself thi has
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00002.flac	that's wonderful it's great to find a thing like that and to use it some
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00003.flac	tell thetell you when the chritics said co noyo do previews you do you play for weeks
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00004.flac	that pulls the actor the true actor back to the theater all the time because there's the only
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00005.flac	you'll you'll open a door and and say i will not that's all it'll take you half a day to shoot that
id10284_Uzxv7Axh3Z8_00006.flac	although people get a lot more aclame for movie work than they do for stage work but the most satisfying for me is doing it on
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00001.flac	i was the crew chief on an airplane it all took place on an airplane and the all the the the plain crashes and all the men go back they're dead and they return home a chearful subject for just nineteen forty
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00002.flac	and the play lasted a week i didn't think i would last either because my voice wasn't louder
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00003.flac	together and caan had directed the skin of ourteeth and wasn't happy with his direction of fantasy so he picked a little scene from a a one act play of williams called ten blocks on the camino real
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00004.flac	and he wanted to just work on it as a director and i was playing in mister roberts at night after the show was over eleven fifteen we'd meet at the actor studio and we'd work till one o'clock in the morning and he'd directed then he showed it to tenes and tenec was absolutely astounded at what casan had found in a fantasy sense with thi scene
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00005.flac	so he said incidentally they're gonna do my play the rose tato and he should play manga cavalo so that's how i got to play the rose
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00006.flac	a performance can change the message of a play the play dealt with a man me who resists becoming a rinoseris who resists the curant who stands up and defiyes people you know he doesn't
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00007.flac	thenon never to question or dout her selection of whatever it is what colors she wants it was you remember there used to be u the the flapper girls
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00008.flac	ofwork i  i was playing an ouriental the following year or but a a few years before that in
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00009.flac	four nights before pal joy had opened and they buoed the poor actor dancer who was superb in the part so i came out to take my curtain call thinking if you're b i'm gonna bo right back an
id10284_YN4cTBWM-QE_00010.flac	i was terrified and they didn't boo but the reason they liked that place so much it was the first time americans didn't take themselves quite so seriously and didn't think they were gonna inform the world of their brilliance
id10284_rOcOdev0azY_00001.flac	he's not only mastere the craft of acting but also the art of carring
id10285_5nGO1Mq_iGM_00001.flac	it's just an anoyance at this point we 're obsessed i'm not kidding like we left our madmen premer to go play
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00001.flac	to be the best person that she can be and she might faile at it but
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00002.flac	continue to grow i think she will continue to be floed uh but we know what happened to those o
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00003.flac	private life and whether or not she ever really gets a handle on that or whether she winds up with you
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00004.flac	for people especially for people that have been loyal and sort of watched all of this
id10285_9HcPA8lluoY_00005.flac	but also satisfactory in a way of finally getting to delve into these
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00001.flac	yeah and the truth of what happened you know and the truth of what happened behind the
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00002.flac	did all our research for us uh of mary and dan and her team
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00003.flac	it's very detailed and um it has a lot
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00004.flac	um information that obviously i isn't necessary to kind of put in the film um but for me and for everyone elsewas really helpful the to have that
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00005.flac	and ten to even just do the scenes over and over when you're constantly sort of
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00006.flac	that they used and u you know they're real and there's george bushe's name and you know signitures and and
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00007.flac	of people in generals from that time  i never would have known otherwi
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00008.flac	into that part of it um she i think she does she didn't know that i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00009.flac	she obviously has played um a couple of extremely well known uh real life people and she was talking about it and i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00010.flac	like very interested in what she was saying cause i might be doing that and i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00011.flac	so good at it but you don't feel like she's impersonating anybody you feel like she's
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00012.flac	is so uncanny in toronto bob wasn't there but dan was and i found after watching the film
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00013.flac	they both have this sort of heroic legandary quality you know they both have that so even though they don't necessarily
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00014.flac	somehow it's that you really can replace bob with dan and
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00015.flac	and with them i'm actually on their side i think that what you know i think that marry was right and what they did
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00016.flac	that she investigated and told on sixty minutes was
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00017.flac	facts of of of the story that that she investigated and i think that that's i i
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00018.flac	andi you know i wanted her to kind of have that sort of um reality to her um besides that
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00019.flac	the first time he cried um and when we saw it intoronto he was very emotional afterwards i mean i can't imagine what that's like to have sort of this story told that is a very important time
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00020.flac	and to have robert read for telling it you know n he meend to have somebody su who's so brilliant doing it so well
id10285_FUqAFZmZJ80_00021.flac	his somebody who is a seker of truth and he's somebody who is really
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00001.flac	thre year old actress in new york i was like this is amazing oh please please let me play this part um and i loved her and i loved the character and she
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00002.flac	an um and then it just grew from there and you know the the the script was obviously what attracted all of us originally and then when we all got involved youknow  started to meet the cast and the casti was awesom and the producers were asomen the
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00003.flac	and that didn't work out and maybe she's supposed to be like don maybe shep posd to be a man maybe she's supposed to cut herself off from being a woman
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00004.flac	and i think that you know over the past three seasons that was her sort of ark and and in the four season i really feel like she's starting she hasn't yet but i really feel lik she's starting to become the person that she
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00005.flac	and she's starting to become herself and not feel like she has to be um something that she has seen or someone in the office or someone you know that she's
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00006.flac	you know they make mistakes and they do bad things but they're not they're not bad people you know and that's very true to life and that's very true to to human
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00007.flac	ther jobs are selling happiness every day to the public and
id10285_LbFFEF1pHO0_00008.flac	nd you know that against you know their own struggle for their own personal happiness is very interesting so i don't consider any of the characters bad people um they do very
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00001.flac	n i mean everyone is so nice and uh tom and look i sort of worked with the most and um they couldn't be nicer gentlemen honestly we had
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00002.flac	like one of the funniest people i know he's hilarious so basically in between takes ioud just o lik giggling at everything
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00003.flac	we filmed in belfast uh which ias really cool cause i've never been to ireland so it was really really awesome i really loved i loved ireland honestly
id10285_Zdmm9Mrr8Ts_00004.flac	it's such a well respected festival thatas such a range of films from small films to bigger you know big blocqestar films and i think that you know there's sort of a aa cassha and a respect that comes with the festival so it's it's it's an honor in a way you know um that a few festivals are but i feel like people have a lot of respect for
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00001.flac	have actually um part of the reason is i don't remember anything so i didn't remember what happened in the first episode till i saw it i couldn't tell you what happens in the second one so i'm very good for spoilars because i just don't remember what happend i've i've been asked recently what my favorite episodes of the show are and we had to like go online and look at all the seasons because i couldn't remember what happened when um so i'm just bad at it so it's not really even any i'm not like some like export at it i just don't remember so i'm good for
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00002.flac	that episode sort of surpassed i think what television can do or has done you know t sort of set a standard um that i certainly cannot take sol credit fore i mean it's a brilliant script
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00003.flac	hous i do feel like you know madmen isn't even dead and berried yet
id10285_bd0jqkNxNdU_00004.flac	very much not up to me but uh i i i'm not onng to look a gift warce in the mouth so you know we never know buth i think i'll pause just a second and let people enjoy madmen
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00001.flac	she's come a long way obviously i i don't think her journey is over by any means uh
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00002.flac	fe seasons the first three seasons were all about especially the second season ite was a big ark was all about her figuring out you know what it meant to be this woman in a man's world and did she have to be like don or did she have to be a man or dids wou know did she have to play up her sexuality or a
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00003.flac	who she is and how she can just be herself and she doesn't have to be either one but she just be herself and um i think thei the idea of the differences and similarities between then and now is one of the most intriguing things about the show for the audience and you know just playing that game of comparison and it's definitely sparked a lot of um discussions and and questions and i've been a part of the
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00004.flac	first start watching the show and you know there's that first funny thing of likeoh wow my god look at that that's so different we don't
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00005.flac	episodes start to see things that you see here now and things that either you've experienced or seen someone do or done yourself and you startto sort of get uncomfortably similar
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00006.flac	to those characters and and i think that that's what has sustained the show past it's the original sort of guymmic of it being in that time period is that these
id10285_d-ZEojJk-rs_00007.flac	mman beings and they're they're they're they're people just really they're still like us and we're still like them and and i think that's something that's become far more interesting than just it being in
id10285_dG-z37iVdzA_00001.flac	i'e realized what we what we're missing what we need though is more monsters with
id10285_eZFHx8-7rX0_00001.flac	self as an individual tha that's a good way of putting it is like a better version a better ow not necessarily changing who you are
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00001.flac	i was really happy with it i mean i was very happy with my storyline you know she's had a rough roade as far as relationships go
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00002.flac	of bad decisions and uh a lot of hung over mornings and i was happy that she got the most romantic scene on
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00003.flac	this um huge theater with like thousands of people on ala uh i think they like live stream dat or whatever it's called and so we watched it with like a bunch of people a lot of fans were there
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00004.flac	the show mat always made sure that the other actor on the othrt the phone was always there so you had to come
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00005.flac	and do your other side of the phone call off camera for the person it was like a rul that particularly one was different because he was in big sur um so they didn't wanna bring me out there and i sort of insisted that they get me on the phone for it bcase it was like our last
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00006.flac	sce like i have to be on the other end of the phone so they actually turned the payphone into a phone so that he could actually call me and it was super early in the morning so i was like in bed obviously
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00007.flac	and i was like in my pajamas like with coffe  tey'm like my cat like al of the
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00008.flac	with jon like playig dohn he's like crying and i'm like trying to get the cats to be quiet
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00009.flac	it was really havy and then the painting was kind of auwgkwuard and kind of large and they wanted me to hold it so that you could see it in certain shots and then the cigaret is actually
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00010.flac	trying to look cool like trying not to drop the painting trying not to like bump into the walls and then they played they were lik hat do ou wanna listen to and i was like stang
id10285_m-uILToQ9ss_00011.flac	really valued it and it was really special for us cause we were both like big fans of each other personally and professionally and and so we always really loved when we got to do stuff so i loved that in the last few episodes i got like some huge slattery
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00001.flac	the time period is so enticing and it's so beautiful to watch and there's obviously uh just the time period of the sixt seson advertising is so enigmatic and it's
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00002.flac	um i mean obviously you know as an actor you you do bring elements of yourself to a character that's what you have to go on um at the same time she'ss very different she's
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00003.flac	um t much more i think niive than i am less life experience um so she's very different but at the same time i
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00004.flac	it's a big question um i think that you know that's a question that's been asked many times over the past five
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00005.flac	but there are similarities and differences and things that have improved and things that have not improved and obviously we've come a long way in many ways um that has been very beneficial to women and i think that we've lost things in other ways uh
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00006.flac	oknot that sense of mystery about women uh the way that they dress you know that's sort of gone
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00007.flac	and lucky to play it um and then you know as far as how
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00008.flac	you know we both try to be good people uh i think that she's ah a relatively honest person and she tries to do the right
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00009.flac	and um the secrets that they already know about each other are
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00010.flac	bgosh uh favorite comercial i love apple ads i think appls pretty great um they'
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00011.flac	is is very different from now um it's a it's a world that i never thought i would have anything to do with and now i do which is kind of
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00012.flac	yeah absolutely that's i mean the thing is you're in people's homes and uh it's funny when people come up to me i find that they they'll say that to me they say
id10285_thghCiJZYwI_00013.flac	and i understand it's you're in their home every week and um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00001.flac	perfect kind of moment where this pilot came along and i and i was in new york at the time i was cast out of new york and everybody was busing about this show madmen and thend this other show which
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00002.flac	and um i said i wanna work with that man and i ment mat um i just was like i i wanna work with him
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00003.flac	you could see that in his face and you could see that in his eyes even just in the audition and um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00004.flac	i loved the role and i felt like the the what i did with the role in that audition what i did who pegy was in that audition was the same person that he wrote so i just felt like we we really clicked
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00005.flac	she's never been in the big city and um now she's
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00006.flac	and she's been working in a man's world for a few years and i think that for me the best way to describe her is just that journey that everybody
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00007.flac	you know twenty to thirty she grows up and she becomes harder in a lot of ways she gets her heartbroken she
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00008.flac	cross or not but i hope that she still retaines that sense of honesty and sort of positivity and truth that i think that you know she's very
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00009.flac	she just s very much believes in whatever she's
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00010.flac	and um i think that she still has that despit the fact that she's like had some
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00011.flac	on having to go from that frompby
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00012.flac	y through these clothes which is what janey does and what any good costume designer does um makes my job so much easier
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00013.flac	plad and plad with pocaduts and like turtlenics and then little i mean haven't gotten o were so much of them but like pants with a
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00014.flac	with the character and through the clothes is been i mean it makes my job so much
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00015.flac	and we put it in and they played the song every time we did it and it was um it was a very special kind of moment um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00016.flac	if he'd seen us doing it like we used to just slow dance in the middle of the office for no reason just like bord you know and since season one and i asked mat if he'd seen us do it and he'd said no so it was a weird kind of it was just a a weird coincidence and um
id10285_uArtiTSTnSU_00017.flac	you know made the script come first nothing else it is the story that comes first and and that's why we're still here and that's why people stoll
id10286_0sETQ5nxvf8_00001.flac	um and i just find that fascinating so i go and i kind of make up careers or like stories to tell the overdriver so i totally just like lied to them and i got in the over like the other day and the guy was you know who's talking about his kids and like his merital problems and he's like oh well you have kids don't you and i was like yeah i have two kids i h've a boy
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00001.flac	i'm a soffmore this year so um and i went my freshman er which was like really
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00002.flac	um she comes with me um the same lady and um when i'm when i'm filming and we have to do all the work and all the test and everything and send it back the day that it'so do for everyone else yeah so it's like i have to just you have to keep up because then when you come home from you know your movie you if you're not if you don't keep up you're like lost
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00003.flac	starting out um when i was little like i had tlhike the best teachers for science so they may they kind of made me like it more b but now i'm doing chemistry this year and then i have physics next year which i hope i still like it after that cause i a
id10286_4TtOX8dgtYI_00004.flac	i mean i would say that i mean it always has been kind of like my celebrity crust uh
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00001.flac	the box trols well um the box trols theyare little creatures that live
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00002.flac	me myself doesn't really matter it's all about the way i sound so um i just i had to remember that and like get used to uncomfortable that you know it dosn't matter about the emotion in your eyes you know you have to portray the emotion that would be in your eyes and your voice  you have to just get those layers into the way you talk which atf i was
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00003.flac	it was amazing cause i obviously wasn't i mean i did visite portland origan wirhther
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00004.flac	l like to say that i'm like intervoe with him but then maybe like jist fats dissatisfying that like i didn't get to
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00005.flac	but we were i didt get to meet him at commycon cause when we went so i met him then he doesn't sound anything like
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00006.flac	um we did a session together and with isic uh we did a session together which was nice cause h you know i it was also kinda like you want other actors they're you o tri
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00007.flac	um we did when we talked when we did the scene about talking about the fathers um me and isac did that cause that's kind of moref like an emotional not not an action
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00008.flac	you have to see the box roles because it's extremely clever and it's unlike anything you've seen before
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00009.flac	well obviously these little guys are definitely judged by kind of their name and the way they
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00010.flac	hey're very scared and um and an order for them to show people who they truly are they have to overcome their feaer and they have to stop being
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00011.flac	is an orphan in a way so he um he's trying to figure out you know what what is a family you know what what dies it supposed to be and uh yea we have a good talk about kind of that you know a fathere's always supposed to be there for you no matter what
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00012.flac	aalso i oa fish who's one of the box troles is like eg's father um even though you know he doesn't really fit you wouldn't think of him as a father cause he's a little box troller
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00013.flac	dn't really fit the the norm but he he treats egs like um like a fatherly figure so even though they're not related he still treats him that way and so he's like a
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00014.flac	well it's all hand made so when you watch it and i feel like you
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00015.flac	you can see the heart like and you can just tell that like fingers molded all of this and it
id10286_7I1GtGzVfmw_00016.flac	it's something i mean you don't you obviously don't see them doing it but it you can tell you know it sets it apart thend it's just it's not just from a computer it's made from
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00001.flac	without reading the script or anything i i went in and i met with um rob linda and joe
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00002.flac	um from that first meeting they they told me about the story and
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00003.flac	u a disney princess and um and from that meeting we just we got along so well and um they were so
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00004.flac	then um they they gave me the script after that meeting and i went home and read it right
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00005.flac	it's the classic story of you know sleeping beauty plus so much more information so you get to
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00006.flac	you get to know why things happen and why you know molipicent becomes so evil and sort of the steps that it takes to because you know people aren't just evil just because you know there has to be a coaus and nd you an in our film you get to see sort of what that couse
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00007.flac	sort of brining the essence of her and i know like you when you see pictures of her sort of the way she stands with their hands and o i was just sort of taking it all in and before the before we started filming this movie i watch the
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00008.flac	uh movie again just to sort of see if i could pick up on any little manerisms that she did
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00009.flac	sort of in the forest and sort of brought those little princess elements but you know also wanting to make
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00010.flac	um you know have those elements but also make her a real person not just a just an animated character sso
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00011.flac	the fixies and they're they're my ants as well so and when you get to see them
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00012.flac	is big they're tiny and then um when they become you know the human form when they have to take care of baby orora you know they grow
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00013.flac	they have to be like peasant women which i don't think they enjoy very much they they like their wings and thei'r funny costumes
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00014.flac	and you know with the horns and so the intensity and all and all that and we definitely have that and
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00015.flac	malifacente bird sort of her pet bird and she gets we get in our film we get to see him as a man as well because she turns
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00016.flac	turns im into a man and that um and when i meet and when i'm little i i i play with the bird i do see the bird i pet you know and i have a pretty bird is what i call him and um and then when i get older i get to see see him in
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00017.flac	to see his character from when he's young and sort of it's a journey for him as much as as much as it is for melipacent in a way you get to sort of see why he becomes so evil and why she becomes you know so evil so they both have er
id10286_9K2YB1d8BqY_00018.flac	that christi sen um after that melifisan sort of follows arora around um while arora's growing up so you get to see me sort of in different stages as you know young a todler and then sort of eight years old and then you finally see me sort of as a teenager and malificent is sort of there hiding away every in every step of those
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00001.flac	this is different and um and i and i like i like
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00003.flac	and so once you hear that i'm like o i hope i get to do that and then he wanted to meet with me and and
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00004.flac	the the story of it and what it you know what it really was about about these beauty obsessed women and um i was so all in so
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00005.flac	well the way that um nick works was very um different from how i had worked before it was extremely close and we were going off instincts the whole time we would we would change things along the way and he allowed me i'd never felt um this much freedom on a set he kind of he allowed me to put my
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00006.flac	views or even as being a teenager myself i was sixteen my character was sixteen so there would be a lot of things where i'd be like nick she would never say this or you know she would never wear
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00007.flac	freedom it was um it was a strange but mazing feeling to work that
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00008.flac	say this or you know she would never wear this and he's like okay we we'll change it w'll cangeu so um yeah i' never felt that freedom it was um it was a strange butmazing feeling to work that way and we filmed in sequence in cronological order so that was very helpful cause she does you know um
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00009.flac	i i related kindof the one thing was that she's you know she's from a small town and moves to a big city and we made her from georgia which is where i'm from and moved to la so i understood
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00010.flac	seeing a big city ind in fresh eyes and and also being the youngest person around cause i mean i started acting
id10286_DPPq8w5ILrA_00011.flac	when i was young so i know how it feels to be
id10286_FP4TghS5_UQ_00001.flac	the pronowuns hat he him you know so um we we wanted to talk a bouth that but  it's nice that our film i think our film's unique in that way where it's they've been living with him for a very long time now but then it's
id10286_FP4TghS5_UQ_00002.flac	starts where boom he wants to take the next step and and get the testastrone and um
id10286_FP4TghS5_UQ_00003.flac	you know i i'm not playing a female so um that was interesting to feel a lot of female energy but i wasn't contributing to
id10286_J37FfHHefdc_00001.flac	wewell we get the senur padio which is a huge deal because um if you're not a s if you're not a senior you're not allowed to be on it as an underclassman so now we can like kick off all the freshmen and kick off all the juners to be like
id10286_J37FfHHefdc_00002.flac	alene on all the doors and zip tied all the lockers shut and stol all
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00001.flac	that i was getting accepted into the like a family so that was nice she has her coreline dall and now i have my winny so um it's very cool but i was really familiar with their stop motion and you know in their movies cause i' i felt like i grew up with it kind of cause my sister for like seven or eight years she was voicing corline and i did get to go to portland and visite the um the studios with her so i
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00002.flac	um in in their world so i i knew i was familliar with itn i think they kind of they asked me to do this cause they they already knew
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00003.flac	y in so i love the um the the teenage like the girl in it uh yeah and i i i did get to seet when i went to the box trols um uh when i went to the i went up to portland and saw the set there and then i saw para norman like some of ther dalls they have sitting out and the girl is just so funny she has her fingernailes or painted pink and she has like a pink track suit thits wis tiny i'm like and it's real tery
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00004.flac	i i i feel like i've never played um someone like her before cause she definitelys kind of a brow
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00005.flac	a you know like she's she's not someone that you you kind of wanna dislike her but then you don't
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00006.flac	feel you know it's similar because i still prepare in the same way as i still imagine that i'm this person
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00007.flac	andand work with the script and feel like i'm i'm still becoming a character but then it's very different cause you don't have your face to rely on you don't have your eyes to kind of show that emotion and every all the layers have to be depicted in the way you sound which at first was definitely like a challenge for me cause i was i felt like i was like really acting with you like with my face is like you don't have to do that
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00008.flac	you just make sure that it it comes out and your voice betrays the emotion so then you get more comfortable with it but that was that'
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00009.flac	i i cause ive you kno i like to play that game like when i watch animated films like trying to guess you know the celebrity y and like i think we're gonna stump a lot of people with this one they're go i s
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00010.flac	just seeing how small these things are and realizing that every single thing you see on screen is handmade by the odest materials and they're all have all these mecanics underneath them
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00011.flac	lip can snarl and like the everything um and everything
id10286_L2jRsPDZGgw_00012.flac	is done by  human touch and i an you can really tell that lik there's a lot of heart that goes into it i think like five seconds takes two weeks to do
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00001.flac	they do movies that they're not just like oh for you know funny for kids like whatever they like have like meaning to them and um they're also they're very
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00002.flac	i did my nabor todera with maybe i was younger but i did uh my nagbor totero with my sister and that
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00003.flac	andand that took her about like seven years she was doing it for that long cause it was likas first uh stop motion that they had
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00004.flac	what they did so then later when like just a couple years ago wend they asked me to do box trols i was
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00005.flac	anu and no one i i like when like new creatures or
id10286_PlJd6NVoigs_00006.flac	da um i would with my sister at least i guess i was kind af trying to get attention but it never worked cause i i did it every singal year but i would like pretend that like i fell
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00001.flac	like completely i was int shoct cause i loved all houses when i when i was very young um
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00002.flac	and it was just like minitures everywhere uh and
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00003.flac	blew my mind that there were people like out there that that did this it was just
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00004.flac	yeas cause i knew everyone and i was just i loved the box rol script and i loved win
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00005.flac	il lik she's kind of like an unexpected maybe character for me to play just cause i do't know i've never played me one like her before she has like this kind of brady element and she's like slightly spoiled um but i liked how
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00006.flac	d but then on the inside she's like loves all these like little  grotesk
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00007.flac	outand um and and and that was fun to to just be kindof
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00008.flac	uh uh first when the audience sees her they might not like her so much she's a little snoody but um but afterwards like she she wins you over and you realize kind of what she is and she has a sensitive side and she's just trying to help egs and get the attention from her dad that she that she wants and uh yeah she's uh a very very
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00009.flac	make sure that it's right aus also i mean with being with other english actors in the fil
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00010.flac	okay jobs i mean i did have a dialect coach that was with me and um she was on set ur i
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00011.flac	butum with me in there and she would pe you know perfect little words and get it right and we wanted to make i think that winnies was a little more posser than ih'd ever done cause you know she's she's high aleat of the cheese bridge
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00012.flac	i hope so i mean i i think so whenever it happens i don't know when we're gonna um film it but when they
id10286_Qkll9n7U5ak_00013.flac	yeah  we i've never read it before so i'll do my i'll do it i'll do all the research has i need to
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00001.flac	such a close bond i've never really had that with the director being so collaborative it was like i would show up in the mornings and
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00002.flac	um and that was just extraordinary to have and his style and all of his choices and you know the the shots it was just so specific and everything ment something and it was so detailed and it was like doing u and it was so artistic like a photo it wasn photograph
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00003.flac	so mixing that with you know the the fashion world and and these women is just an ex it's an extraordinary thing and i think the the film you know having all those very complex themes it's
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00004.flac	it's all with girls so um and and it's i feel like a lot
id10286_ZAK9gLYNqPs_00005.flac	crazy so people are just looking at this fal image that's not perfect o the when they see a real human being they're like oh you're not perfical it's like what you're looking
id10286_a3QzK5pWpI4_00001.flac	nuhi'm not uh but yeah she's five four and i'm about five six and a half five
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00001.flac	be uh a tomoro which um i's very scary for me to think about as well and i think that
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00002.flac	one person cause they've grown up together their whole lives spent every day with one
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00003.flac	thi for me it was all the different emotions that jinger gets to go through and i thought it would be
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00004.flac	completely perfect i mean after reading the script the script is perfect and and saly
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00005.flac	they're they're completely different cause mine was in the sixties and then hers was more modern and in a different area so they're completely differenther she did
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00006.flac	eaccent something different ih'd neverd done an accent before um i was definitely a little nervous about it just because it's something new but um we um before we started shooting
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00007.flac	the dile which sally didn't want um sangra on set because you know she wanted us to think more about the scenes and the characters and and have the dialects sort of be already there and you know one less thing to worry about which it was nice to have it sort of
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00008.flac	i think that it was so exciting to see so many different types of people um in one film just
id10286_cJ40ZqTY3dQ_00009.flac	ferent totally different personalities and but they all sort of they worke together
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00001.flac	at new york um but she'll come uh home to la and we spend it together
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00002.flac	and uh decorated and then every year i give everyone an ornament in my family so uh i have like a special
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00003.flac	accurate and beautiful and even the costumes i got to weare some really beautiful costumes and ur costume designer down to like the underwarer in socks all from the
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00004.flac	chris cooper's in the movie he's my father um and he's the chief of poliece in floreda and i you kind of see her start when she's she' younger and and then she wants to go to hollywood to become a star but she doesn't quite make it there and falls in to kind of a dark place and comes back and is born a
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00005.flac	and becomes an evangelist preacher during the prohibition and so she's speaking against alcohal and drugs and gambling which is bad for
id10286_gkDeAS985L4_00006.flac	he's in the scene with you you don't feel like he's critiking you ere directing you
id10286_iH0jGPqp3Hc_00001.flac	do we need where is my character going and it kinda just ent relied on instincts and in the mornings i would show up and he'd be like so what are you what are you feeling today like what do you wanna do and i'm like god likei
id10286_iH0jGPqp3Hc_00002.flac	we made herto come from like a small town go to a big city which is what i
id10286_iH0jGPqp3Hc_00003.flac	look skinniyer or there's it's like crazy so people are just looking at this fal image that's not perfect o the en they see a real human being they're like oh you're not perfical it's like what you're looking at is is fake so it's kind
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00001.flac	ben is bin aflick's gonna you know tht here's a script that he's gonna direct and that he wroate you're and he's gonna star ind you're like alright yes like whatever
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00002.flac	um great um but i of course i read the script and really you the way that it's written
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00003.flac	the action sequences kind of playing out and it's so many different things going on and time periods and um and obviously loretta she really you know stuck out to me and uh and after reading i really was like i hope i hope i get the part
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00004.flac	oso an i had to meet with ben but yeah it was really great
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00005.flac	so well and how to kind of create the best environment to
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00006.flac	facilitate your best performance and to ma and to want to um just let everyone be creative and
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00007.flac	and he's just so kind of giving in that way and um and and then as a director it's i can't b like his organization in his mind you know to have to to switch and switch but when you'r
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00008.flac	he is my first day on set my first scene was the scene with i o know i g but with
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00009.flac	and it was like it's a very intense scene after i've like come back from hollywood um and
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00010.flac	and icause i think for a while she didn't really get to face her demons like she should have cause she was very
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00011.flac	busy kind of up in the clouds saying these words that she kind of i think believed in the beginning but started to started to trail off and so she didn't really get to to face all those like she should have maybe it would 've worked out better
id10286_isKyMAYUOgg_00012.flac	there's um there there's a woman uh amy simple macfeerson uh which you kind of can we based a lot of kind of loreta's look off of her her white and the big juoled crosses um and things and there was uh yeah there was you two videos that i had watched actually i was like this amazing video of her
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00001.flac	in the movie is sort of the lonely more doesn't really have anything to do with his life and then cleo sorto comes in and she
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00002.flac	you know taking care of him she's making him breckfust and things like that she's being like the mom to him in a way and um but yeah she's just a normal eleven year old girl i was eleven when i shot it and um so i could relate to her a lot think
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00003.flac	playd um rock band a lot with steven cause we did a lot of rehearsals and um
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00004.flac	i think i got like on es i got like a ninety seven or something it was not
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00005.flac	but both of us really had to be like we play it all the time so we sortaf taught us how to do the whole thing and yeat we were gellous of him cause he was so
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00006.flac	guy skating it helps with the balance ind posture but um i felt a lot when i was training i trained for about
id10286_lBkbWztMEUY_00007.flac	like a huge deal now and it got so big it was sort of not even
id10286_lJQTN_wK9vA_00001.flac	i was to it's funny because when we were filming it it was all green screen and there wasn't trans flying above you it wasn't like that al so seeing it for the first time with everything put together it was crazy i was screaming you know it i couldn't believe it looked like that and it
id10286_lJQTN_wK9vA_00002.flac	it was exactly like it was on screen really we had the best time together and i we laughed so much we just  uh uh all of them were so cool and i was the youngest one i was twelve they
id10286_lJQTN_wK9vA_00003.flac	that that's what he used to film with when he was a kid with all his friends he was like one of
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00001.flac	we try to perfect it so i wouldn't be you know when we started filming that was just already there so i wouldn't be thinking about that cause the audience can definitely tell bhut you're you know thinking about that one
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00002.flac	e she we did our accents were different cause mine was in the six seaso hers was more
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00003.flac	each other tips but um hers was i i thought it was impecable she did such a
id10286_mYc2BIS0zWU_00004.flac	i did a little bit but i also i saly grew up in that time so from that i sorta picked her brain about what it was like and sort of growing up in the time of how it was so scary
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00001.flac	inthe original animated version sleeping beauty in that one arora she's very
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00002.flac	yeah everything that you think a princess is and kind of all those characteristics she she definitely
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00003.flac	but in ours she' still is that way and she loves everyone and um it's very open and and she's not a
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00004.flac	malificent she's like everyone's normally so scared of me but arora you know she hasn't learned
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00005.flac	she daesn't learned to be scared of things that um look od or you know creatures that have horns and um   and it's nice for arora and this when she has more depth and obviously thereae a lot of secrets um there that that that are kept from her um you know she thinks both of her parents ar dead and she lives kind of very isolated in this cotteage with her three fairy anties and um so she doesn't really know much about you know outside of the
id10286_mmFmN0OPhKs_00006.flac	and it's nice that i could bring you know more layers to her and um and and and have more strength than just kind of the pretty pretty princess you know that's in in the
id10286_pqJw3UuOuCY_00001.flac	pl a snozer pudtel mix dog and i also have a
id10286_pqJw3UuOuCY_00002.flac	i go to classes so i always have to throw it up but mostly i just like i twist it like
id10286_rPKjog9010U_00001.flac	make a supermodel and so she would uh she would inform
id10286_yAe_ZhyWdnI_00001.flac	d and i i kinda had one i um well last year um the boyo who asked me um he was a junior so
id10286_yAe_ZhyWdnI_00002.flac	with your car so he called me  at school one day and um he was like i gottein a car accident come down to my car and i' w like oh gosh like i go in a panic mode i'm like running down
id10286_yAe_ZhyWdnI_00003.flac	and um and then he was in the front seet and he was like can you look in the back trunk um to get a tool box and so
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00001.flac	only difference is her nees were pulled on the way up to her chest
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00002.flac	redecorating my house so i'm always being createde i find that
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00003.flac	uh tenna s williams and his beautiful writing his wonderful
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00004.flac	in all its forms if i'm not doing a play or a picture i'm photographing or i'm writing
id10287_2iaCNe7ajII_00005.flac	uh tenna s williams and his beautiful writing his wonderful
id10287_4SgMBa9MUvc_00001.flac	have old friends that i rely on that are part of my life and have been for
id10287_4SgMBa9MUvc_00002.flac	um and it's about uh people relating and and trying to overcome
id10287_4oOmqI1myzY_00001.flac	we haven't started yet i mean we're just beginning to talk about casting i was offered the part
id10287_4oOmqI1myzY_00002.flac	then as i was reading it i started in visioning scenes um and then i told the writer and the producer about the scenes i was invisioning and they liked it and then i said well why don't iy direct it and
id10287_8vC0LQMqy8Y_00001.flac	filming alis doesn't live here anymore and the exersist opened in twoson so and it was around my birthday so i threuw a party for the cast and crew of alice
id10287_8vC0LQMqy8Y_00002.flac	and i got up and followed her and she got to the top of the ramp of the ile and she fainted and i went over to help her and uh i
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00001.flac	and uh i remember one morning i left town
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00002.flac	the first one i left town cause i was so excited about it i thought i really must cam down so i i made myself take a drive and not
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00003.flac	when i got home i had bokays of flowers all over my doorstep so i knew i was
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00004.flac	most of the times that i was nominated i was working in between so um i i i didn't dwell on
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00005.flac	uh but it's hard not to it kind of takes over your mind for
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00006.flac	well i wasn't there i was on broadway in th same time next year
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00007.flac	let you off well they would let me off ba to wanna go but i i didn't think it was fair cause  people waited so long and they got tickets sometimes three or four months ahead of time
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00008.flac	it was fun uh we were shooting in pitsberg and i liked pitsberg very much and uh
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00009.flac	a wonderful person to work with and the rest of the cast too i love my daughter julian more she's uh i think new exciting beautiful um
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00010.flac	now it's a movie about relationships and there are too many of those arond the
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00011.flac	uan i'm i'm glad to see that it got made and um i hope
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00012.flac	i i still get letters it wasn't the most successful movie i did but i still get
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00013.flac	um use it in their workshops and um onheling and on dying and a lot of people whad told me that they were with their parents when they died because of having seen the movie and i think it's changed people's attitude tha people who h've been exposed to it a lot about about death
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00014.flac	um and i used to play always good mothers lately i've been playing bad mothers and
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00015.flac	you know there are a lot of really wonderful actresses uh who aren't
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00016.flac	um because they're at the roles for them so i don't think there's a lack
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00017.flac	you know it's not just that they're not writing the parts i think it's a reflection of our culture that
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00018.flac	um when i made alise doesn't live here anymore in nineteen seventy four there weren't any films being made from a woman's point of view was a kind of watershed picture and i think thats changed
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00019.flac	actresses have taken it apon themselves to make their own work
id10287_I99R40TUF1s_00020.flac	when you work in a film where you don't have much to do it's that's when you don't really know what to do with yourself you know when you have a a story where there's a lot o happening and there's a lot to work on that's when it becomes very challenging and
id10287_MHoaMi5hKkE_00001.flac	we're all swarn to secresy we can't talk about it it's a a space travel i think i can say that cifi it's
id10287_MHoaMi5hKkE_00002.flac	yeah he's wonderful um and there a lot of actors
id10287_MHoaMi5hKkE_00003.flac	i think so i haven't seen it but i saw matheu maconehe at thems i said am i still in the film cause i had such a small part it could be cut he said you're in it i've seen it it's great it's
id10287_RfDogGJ-UnM_00001.flac	i think i've been very good about getting my um gols in mind what i wanted
id10287_RfDogGJ-UnM_00002.flac	um but i don't think i've ever been called on to really sacrifice
id10287_V0ubcXO71Sg_00001.flac	so i get to come and visit with her my brother used to live nearbuy so i came
id10287_V0ubcXO71Sg_00002.flac	to see him so i' feel very at home here and then i hear that it's the oldest film festival i didn't know that in the
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00001.flac	i had no idea that it was as popular as it is i mean only since  this season opened last week have i been getting reactions like i've never gotten for anything i've ever done in my career i mean i can't walk my dog without
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00002.flac	its just it's a hugely popular show and and the people
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00003.flac	no i i i i did do dotin abby one o season
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00004.flac	because i i have to watch so many shows for voting um but i did watch a few of these shows and liked it very much but i had no idea that it was what it is to people which is
id10287_bP0bKbQQlzc_00005.flac	diect now though i have a a script called baving flow that i just love and i wanna act in it and directn that's a new challenge i'm looking forward to and you knowwr in the process of rasing monny which is the hardest thing i've ever
id10287_nJkteFlsqPk_00001.flac	thnthat she felt inside that she needed to express to test
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00001.flac	the priests who were working in the film were very active on the set um blessing the set and us and um we were
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00002.flac	and um they're both really wonderful films um and my television series will be
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00003.flac	to that's life and i'm just having the best time i've ever had in my career going to work every day and having a steady
id10287_ryVdclLx7Yo_00004.flac	it's nice to come back to television with such good wriding and
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00001.flac	an experience on its own we saw the film for the first time in its entirety
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00002.flac	ther fans of scot pilgrim and that just was so overwhelming that we got to sit there together as a cast and kind of experience it for the first time in that environment you know because you're there with people who are really passionate about the project and the
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00003.flac	they wanted it to be good and they were and it was it was the reception was was amazing they loved it they laged at all the right parts
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00004.flac	it got to the point wer e were both comfortable with our weapons and i think that was was most important is that we weren't we we didn't feel like we were holding foron objects in our hands and
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00005.flac	was really important and um key to us being able to sort of deliver the
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00006.flac	and that wat the help with of the amazing stunt team we just ihad
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00007.flac	yeah i i would choose kimpine because you know i think it's really cool that she's like girl drummer and she's just kinda sitting there she observes everything and she's just
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00008.flac	um and i think that's just cool because you know i guess it's sort of in a way opposite of nifes
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00009.flac	cause she's just so involved with everything that and kim is sort of she sits back and kinda just takes it in i think that
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00010.flac	yeah well i mean even rit go going right into shooting brion had an
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00011.flac	this fith gen and he was still you know going through that
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00012.flac	and then i think it was during production we got to read that and then the sixt book just
id10288_A3ZvNuG8_oM_00013.flac	it got to the point her e were both comfortable with our weapons and i think that was was most important is that we weren't we we didn't feel like we were holding foron objects in our hands and
id10288_CGFR9WP0Rno_00001.flac	opilgrum it reminds me a lot about the sort of john hew's films um in a way that the sort of onsombol cast coming of age story and i think that's what's really great about scop
id10288_DyK7j3QIO9c_00001.flac	fun about being able to play nives is that you  we can just i could just sort of lk let loose and allow myself to purely and
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00001.flac	you know like i hs a show that's fun but it's also
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00002.flac	who she was and um stand up for herself and to really know what it is that she wanted and her
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00003.flac	written a lovely note to ano sophera u wih cary bradshaw so that was really sweet and i know
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00004.flac	i wanted to see growing up that i never really got to see grace the screens um someone who

id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00006.flac	characters um the writers the the  the entire team on um behind the scenes on the show are have been really great
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00007.flac	pappens you know it happens to everyone and that's where when everything iss sort of a big
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00008.flac	oand we're not trying to be six in the city but again we do have a lot of um the
id10288_FIxC_PNJNkc_00009.flac	lot of them worked also on the sex in the city so um we do have the support of that and and them putting in their input too and writing
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00001.flac	it's ait's a it's been a blast just working on the show um it's essentially  prequl to sex in the city all the same creators onboard kannus bushnel wrote the wrote the book and now it's a tv show and we're really excited about it it's essentially carry bradshaw in her formative years so it
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00002.flac	by the mous and i asked candus bushnel that and she was just very noncelant about it it was just one of those things that kinda stuck she had a friend and they kinda started calling her mouse for some reason and so i i think it's sort of the same thing i mean with with uh with mouse into the cary diries she's got this sort of um way of kind of figuring things out like she plans everything out and she like gathers and
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00003.flac	of a mouse in a way so and pluss she gets to were all these real like really fun mouse pins um on all of her outfit so she has a different mouse pin for every outfit so that's also a reason why that she has that nickname but she's also um karie's loyal supportive friend and uh she's pragmatic and also she's got her life sort of planed out
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00004.flac	realizes along the way that that's not exactly the best way to live your life so
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00005.flac	xist in life and life would be so bland without romance you know it's love is what we need it's what we hate but also
id10288_JzNVSA7eFwc_00006.flac	um sex in the city left such a legasy you know and i hope that we can bring on the same fans but also nourish and develop new fans for this show because it's also geer towards a younger demographic but it's also taking a great character a woman who was just so confident and and unique and okay and had a great sense of self and was
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00001.flac	majored in film ing television um and kind of learned the business side of it and worked on
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00002.flac	and um and then after i finished school that's when i was like okay now it's my time to really kind of
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00003.flac	concept and put it on screen how do you share it with the world um and that to me was always fascinating so um after i finished school i finished university i i decided to just i actually quit all my jobs and my parents i a always crazy because i had a job offer to after school and i was i i was like no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do it theyre like what but
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00004.flac	yu n like they just couldn't fathom the fact that i didn't want to be working but i was like but i am working i am auditioning
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00005.flac	so i mean i think it's  it's um kind of hard for people to
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00006.flac	gras and understand at first but i mean for me it was something i i really needed to
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00007.flac	grasp and understand at first but i mean for me it was something i i really needed to persue
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00008.flac	she just called me up and said um there's this really great role you should go out for so i put myself on tape at first um i didn't have too much time to kinda check
id10288_R4S2c-NiPfA_00009.flac	um what proca and pannarety cry u o o intilan atbaom you what they kind of put out there it's just amazing nd i thinkit
id10288_UbApEUoPvzY_00001.flac	u it's a film but at at the same time i think it's a piece of art becaus there's just so much coming at you visually it's
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00001.flac	you know sort of this uninhibited girl like she's just so much fun and full of energy and and she's just got this genuine love of life and so that was what initially attracted me to her and then after i i remember cause that's howi when i first auditioned for her um for the role that's kind of the side of nizes that i had to show and then when i looked in
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00002.flac	i just thought you know wo she's really cool cause she's got so many sides to her and you get to really start to see her groath and and so i thought that was
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00003.flac	or shooting nets tha you know that time whe were shooting tha scene two it was fun because we got to sort of do the conscerts
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00004.flac	and we couldn't help but keep laughing so i i just remember like it was it took us so
id10288_dRr05CxK0jQ_00005.flac	i think it was really important for all of us to to have read the series before getting into to the shooting part of it because um we we tried to stay so you know true to bry
id10288_mMHfMIiIQP0_00001.flac	just about had his own caribian iland not once but three times three times members of parloment proposed
id10288_owPgCDQ_URk_00001.flac	her first time going through it you know an mean so you're getting the purest most un inhibited feelings ever being shown to you and and i think thats what makes her different
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00001.flac	drict and youd like he'd like take me and be like to master it so by the time you get here i wantna do the first one
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00002.flac	yeah oh absolutely you know i've been i've been writing some scripts for the past couple years and
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00003.flac	you know  i  the a a movie i kindaf want ta make i wrote this script called shack and it's just like this movie takes place in one location and i just though it would be fun to make for like no money with some friends you know getto you get ta make a movie before you make a movie in a
id10290_0bA1AJCGEOo_00004.flac	sense you know you can make something on a super super lo budget small camera with your
id10290_1wx7tV3CrD0_00001.flac	i just remember really being struck by the sense of adventure and like wanting
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00001.flac	youreanan you're like i didn't really feel like i got to know that period that well but one of the joys about working with anglee is that his his beautiful mind and his kind of obsession with every little facet of the detaile of the period really rubs off on everyone else and you really find yourself learning a lot more about uh the
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00002.flac	than you ever thought you would and that was something that that happened with me and i found myself really um you know consuming
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00003.flac	material that he would give me you know a lot of the different dvd i mean he sent me probably
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00004.flac	in the heith ledger had an brook back mountin that i really liked and that was a performance that ang had also directed so there was sm there was some of that you know billiy's not a gay character but there was there was something about the kind of internal conflict
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00005.flac	u the dearhunter where i was like oh that's a great moment that maybe billy could
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00006.flac	it's the sound of the gun that like puts you in that state it's hard to it's hard to think that without actually knowing what it
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00007.flac	those scenes to kind of have that snap quick awarness reaction cause before i i remember i tried it in rehearsal before i
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00008.flac	those little suttleties that maybe a lot of the people in the audience when they watch if there's if it's not there they won't consiously know but what ang is so wt he's part of his genius is filling in all
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00009.flac	little questionmarks to where when people watch it it just has this feeling of kind of honesty and perfection and truth
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00010.flac	just he's obsessed with their work it just shows a you know a dicipline and a passion and a rigore that is only beneficial in my
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00011.flac	if not more a conversation just about what kindaf shoes billy should wearand how
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00012.flac	you know that's just an example of the kinds of details that we would talk about you know and and uh we would have hours just talking about what kind of what kindof person billy was we would create whole stories in our minds about who billy was and what had happened to him and why he feels a certain way and
id10290_A3QwQ3D35rc_00013.flac	i just i loved it i mean i cause ii i'm very similar in the sense that i love to obsess about my character when i work on
id10290_BTnbKeUJ5r8_00001.flac	process when it was actually really really spare i think kinda paull and i were both really prepared and ready to go but i i
id10290_BTnbKeUJ5r8_00002.flac	we knew the material enough to where we could perform the scenes but they still had like a fresh just kinda just out
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00001.flac	exactly the tone of the scenes cause uh you wanna capture that naturalism where people watch and they're like oh i believe these characters i believe these are real people i like these guys but at the same time you know uh you wanna be
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00002.flac	and stuff like that and sometimes there's moments where it goes against being a hundred percent not
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00003.flac	an exciting kinda thriller experience you know with like sify action and
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00004.flac	no just the setting op moscow and ind this kind of different visual language with the three t that people haven't normally seen and i think it's gonna also be pretty scary you know i think
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00005.flac	you know the best elements of of jaws and that kind of where wheres this creature where is this thing i i hope we can bring uh some of that to the screen and i think that that will all make up for a pretty good time
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00006.flac	uhh they told me that olivia was already attached and that was definitely a really big uh
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00007.flac	influence on me wanting to do the film i'd really liked uh a lot of her performances and i thought she was just a rel
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00008.flac	now i'd seen her in a couple a in a i'd seen her in a play with chris pine wi really good
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00009.flac	north and um and i really liked her performance there and i liked her in juno
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00010.flac	i just thought it would be um it'ld be pretty fun to to work with an actor who's never really made a movie like this
id10290_FAOLWl96MY0_00011.flac	that way and uh she's been having a really interesting time and just kind of adapting to this like
id10290_FgJsZ26_AXU_00001.flac	thii i don't know why it works but i know when i feel like it's not working my
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00001.flac	f film and the opportunity to get to work with him and he's made so many classic films over the years and
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00002.flac	he's just uh not only is he a great director but he's just a hilarious wonderfully
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00003.flac	i i don't think i've ever played a character that was probably as amoral in a certain
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00004.flac	abut at the same time it sounds really dark but there's also you know thir's dark humor to it
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00005.flac	i think that everybody's got you know their thei'r light sides and theyire darksides and theyi're good days and thei're bad days so you know it's kind of examining the text an the
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00006.flac	u you know version of it and uh studying that part you know there's so much of that that moral ambiguity and the kind of uh you know he's so conflicted about whether or not
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00007.flac	people and who does he love and who hes not love and i think that that that really helped me when it came
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00008.flac	you know a lot of the guys i grew up with um you know i lived in um tepanga
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00009.flac	uh which is kind of kind of a rural uh community and you know there was times where i remember uh you know
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00010.flac	once you are kind of you know in that environment for long enough you know the trailer becomes it's own
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00011.flac	there is a lot of uh you know new wants to it and and there is the ies and
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00012.flac	i had worked with um uh on into the wild and the character i portrayed in the film chris maccanlis had donated his life savings before he went on this kinda exidus that he did uh to ox fam america the e oxford famin relief ats a humanitarian ade organization and they had asked me when the film came out if i'd be interested in going
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00013.flac	to a part of the world in this case it was the democratic republic of congo and they show you the programs that they have you know with with you know the water you know clean water and
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00014.flac	wells and uh you know food distribution and and um you know support for rape victims and some of the rape clinics that they have out there and then you come back and uh hopefully uh you know you can spread the word about what they do and and they really do a lot of real
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00015.flac	the the freedoms they have the luguries they have everything you everything you have that you take for granted you take tapwater for granted you know i i was staying in you know one of the nicest hotels in the congo and and it barely had running water when i was there you know and and then we went to another part and i i talked to a guy who was
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00016.flac	just appreciate everything you have and and realize that a lot of people have it a lot worse off and that was what i
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00017.flac	you knowbut you can see that anywhere though you know you can see that on the corner there's homeless people i
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00018.flac	cause he was there you know that would be a good title the guy who talks about it cause he
id10290_HYiqXC0B3iY_00019.flac	of me that wants to uh engage in that way um you know and do what i can you know shohn pen has a um u a relief organization that he's

id10290_O-V_sInAw5M_00008.flac	remembered for a really long time you know this is to me one of the greatest
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00001.flac	yeah yeah yeah i watched cartoon net work they were rerunning it so i would always be watch the speed racer growing up i would watch it with my serial and then i'd pore the soda in
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00002.flac	kicking and screaming on the flors my agent look down in disgust and then you know you you just
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00003.flac	ik a huge robatic arm that can like you sit on it and there's like a seat and it just thrashes you around and caun spin you around and it mirrors the movement of a car and it's all on a green screen background and it's nodges and it gives you whip loud
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00004.flac	a like that looks real i mean the effects in this movie are i've gotta
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00005.flac	they would show me some artwork maybe like okay this is what's gonna happen
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00006.flac	conservative driver all my friends were laughing when i got the part cause they all know me as like the granny
id10290_T1y64qFjv3M_00007.flac	it was like the most amazing actor you could ever be aund i mean you're just so rivited by his every movement and hyithn
id10290_VYk_DxNl_T8_00001.flac	uh you know iv i was i felt that i wanted to kind o get micanles i wanted to be true to who he was as a person you didn't wanna just throw the character out the window and do my own interpretation or anything
id10290_VYk_DxNl_T8_00002.flac	kind of touches upon its something that exists within us all you know that that yearning quest for
id10290_VYk_DxNl_T8_00003.flac	into the wild it was such a long hard shoot that i think i just went in to speed racer uh with
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00001.flac	a true story and it just um really struck a cord with me and it seemed like a character that i never really played you know i wasn't easy to playing a tough guy orer ever
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00002.flac	and it was very complicated uh psychologically you know i was trying to let on but not too
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00003.flac	oe of my favorite scenes uh it ended up being that way but i remember there it was like one of the first takes ad theye wers like action and i just like
id10290__mSMCsWY96o_00004.flac	that it gets people a lot more self conscious about the
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00001.flac	he was like alright well let's see how abotd i you wanna do this you'm not giving you the role you train at this procamp that i selected procamp for athleats six days a week at six am you
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00002.flac	five or six hours of training a day which is insane and
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00003.flac	marcus is a very intelligent man and a very detailed oriented person and he wanted nothing less than absolute
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00004.flac	it's an incredible story and a great monument to uh men and women in uniform and people who serve and people who are willing to make those sacrifices and they should be appreciated they shouldn't get lost on the twenty four seven new sicle that we have these days where it's like you heare about something about on the news and two days later it's not even in your mind
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00005.flac	this is a chance to really uh appreciate a really special group of people that uh have made some huge sacrifices for
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00006.flac	he's great confident he so much confidence he's a great man
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00007.flac	a a kind intelligent person who i really really admire and uh
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00008.flac	he knows howt he knew how to navigate the relationships of all the
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00009.flac	wod fallen in a really genuine respectful way where people didn't feel like no one was being shortchanged or taking advantage of or anything like that they they really supported peat and they got behind
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00010.flac	movie and and they like it so it's like kinda like mission accomplished a little bit we sort of feel cause i know for p
id10290_cIi74VD0LF0_00011.flac	group of people he wanted to like the movie he told me that before we've been shot he said that's all that matters is
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00001.flac	you know i tried to just learn as much as i could about him you know through the family i gotta meet with walt and billy machanlis crisis
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00002.flac	you know try to read a lot of the philosophy that chris was reading at the time you know there's walled in by
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00003.flac	and and uh you know ssays and poemes by ralf waldo emerson so there was that kind of philosofical background and and uh the call of the wild by jack london was really
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00004.flac	and uh that wonder lust that exists within us all that i feel as one of the bigge
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00005.flac	to the to the book and and now the film you know if makinlis had had you know personal problems and just ran off next door and you know built train sets no one would hav
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00006.flac	not his clothes his his watch he had a gold watch that he gave to jim galion when jim galion let him off on the stampede trail fourteen years before and in the film jim galian plays himself dropping me off onto the stampeed
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00007.flac	came to set and he actually had a gold watch that chris maccanlis had given it to him fourteen years before so
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00008.flac	me um the gold watch cause he thought i should wear it so i had the gold watch
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00009.flac	he just viewed allaska as the biggest challenge on his plait you know as
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00010.flac	cor survival you know cor independant survival that he wanted to test himself to challenge himself on the hardest trainthat he could find and that to him was
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00011.flac	um well you know i just i just tried to play him for who i thought he was and uh you know if people feel that way they're more than entitled and welcome to feel that way you know there's nothing wrong with feeling like that i don't think uh that's just a perspective on im i
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00012.flac	no i don't i don't feel like i uh short changed uh or uh you know gave macanlis a a phonebooked phonebook to sit under
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00013.flac	al you know to kindaf rase him up um i don't think that any of that was going on and we
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00014.flac	make him look better than than he was cause he wouldn't have wanted that this was a guy who had been running his whole life from stuff that he thought was
id10290_dDnqp9503Mg_00015.flac	make him look better than than he was cause he wouldn't have wanted that this was a guy who had been running his whole life from stuff that he thought was falce and now that you know he was

id10290_fVOTAQKIfY4_00003.flac	i'm i'm i'm actually i'm really hiper aware of how dangerous driving is like all the time lik
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00001.flac	it was only sixteen days prince avalanch it was just a very uh fast
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00002.flac	i think that sometimes some of the smaller movies where it's they don't have enough money to have big action sequences oror necessarily like a a lot of plot uh or a lot of locations
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00003.flac	so that's that's always a benefit for the actors cause you get more more more stuff to play and
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00004.flac	benefits to the audience i guess that just depends on what the audience is looking for you know if you'r if you wanna have a couple laughs and a really enjoyable time  and see if
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00005.flac	i think that that thiss this is like the perfect movie for you to see you know obviously if you wanna see like a robo movi thas probably
id10290_gTbcgoYXWdU_00006.flac	yeah or amping which is when you're practicing your music but you're
id10290_jjzisko126k_00001.flac	you know they they always say that you know when you have a child it's mi blowing experience but you always hear that but then of course it
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00001.flac	n the twenty twenty episode when i was just a kid when i was about eight years old i saw the the twenty twenty episode about it into the wild and chris mackanlisan it always it always stuck
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00002.flac	he's just a fireball of a guy so to get a call from him is it's kinda
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00003.flac	hey're they're scarier than they would seem uh when o when you actually get up close to a
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00004.flac	the integrity of the authenticity went n on what he whatever he
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00005.flac	so we wuld go to all those real locations that chris maccanlis really went to you know if there's a scene where i'm going down uh a river naked in icewater i would be naked in a river
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00006.flac	the the mentality of the shoot but the whole crew we all really we all bonded as a family we got into it
id10290_kKQpvHl21Cg_00007.flac	um you know take the risks that the film required but always to be causious
id10290_lKe4gUde-jg_00001.flac	hitt it presses their sounds come out so i hit it and it was literally a guy saying lines i had in the
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00001.flac	the defining moment where i felt like music heled me out uh yeah

id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00003.flac	i mean i think that tha i mean it's is it's kind of a strange anwer but i mean
id10290_zii-zlYDpGc_00004.flac	so when i made the film like i was very i kind of already knew a lot of that hippy culture and a lot of that whole world

id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00001.flac	when when you're dealing in i in a trama center uh late at night you're gonna get everything right becaus you're gona get all gonshot yvictimes you're gona get people who've been in in high intense accidents and a lot of that stuff happens at night time igh i mean that

id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00003.flac	it's it's pretty real because andy's v we h we had andyand we girl called marisa and we guy called elliet some wered don you know we had some stuff outside we weat a guy falling on a treebranch and then marissa h's been dealing with  with other stuff as well so it's pretty specific and it's pretty real and they're not letting us do anything an less it's it's one hundred percent the way it should be um i i've got a sience degree so i've done micobyology in bybo chemistry and all that crap and it was a paint ing the as um and so i have a i have an idea and i've done lifesaving and all that kind of
id10293_8lGvPwJszxI_00004.flac	the basic aspects of it but they're very very specific about this is how you gotta do things and and so that's taking a bit of time to make sure we get it right beas t's no point there's no point doing it in a high schooli you'regonna do it wrong
id10293_Aj0X181Clk0_00001.flac	s it's hard to ward underwaring anyor i mean those those those pajama type cloths men it's difficult because you got the underwere
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00001.flac	drama film uh feacering myself and tom hopper has two brothers
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00002.flac	it's a drama drawn from um a section of john stymecks
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00003.flac	because it it is a quite a spralling plot that  an awful lot happens and and things just start to occur and i don't wanna give way too much so have to trust me that it's
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00004.flac	various rewards in terms of copies of the script uh you get to come to the screening
id10293_BbAymRBSpPM_00005.flac	come and ctually be in the film itself caus we need actars in certain scenes woe got senes of orself in tom opperan and um if you guys wanna come along they'l be great

id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00001.flac	i i actually just love everything to do with it and to den to do it film and i just think um i think he can as a director as a
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00002.flac	don't have as much control about it and it's a its it is a different it's a different way of working and  atu but at the same time it's all the same thing is
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00003.flac	filmye it's tl yeah i mean that's a very good example i i think i think it's because you get experienced being on set and being with people and kind of gettin
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00004.flac	hol thing and then you get to kind of um you're more aware of how to tell a story i think if you're
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00005.flac	you're more aware of how to tell a story i think if you're working on s as an actor and you see it from a different perspective and get people take you
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00006.flac	i have no idea i think i joined drama because uh there was love to
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00007.flac	culy did the sandtrack um for the first film i i directed christian blake which is reliease and she did the sand track for that and una did a lot of music forer i did a documentary fot so
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00008.flac	and they come from jgermany and australia and astria just to come down and actually watch you film and thou're shooting this sene is tis magnificent counsel and it's kind of like being in a fairy tale and you'r sitingther in france cand this is great n kind of an a holiday and then ire's abot two or twen thof people

id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00010.flac	it's really nice it's almost like doing theater in a way and you're doing this scene and you know and then they'reall watching they're all really sweet and that's kind of
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00011.flac	i think what they do is they have a really interesting take on the whole artherian tales and the and the camalot era and that kind of thing and they they've done a lot of that kind of stuff
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00012.flac	few of those things before and i think wet they do a lot as they have fun with it
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00013.flac	emison it's the jemison empire sixty second competition which myself and jim sherredon which is wonderful aure judging and he did it last year and it it's it's i did a couple of yas
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00014.flac	case you can just go and which a made to make it really interesting at the thing and someone like jim is gonna see it and and a friend of mine did it last year and and a girl acted in one of the pieces it didn't win but jim actually saw her and they wanted to meet her just
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00015.flac	in this piece and and it's a great opportunity to to send something over neal marchal was on it last year and he judgees that at the end lik  keven
id10293_MHOCv7pOmG4_00016.flac	rt new mexico and that's getting released in the sinema in janurary and febory we just fen out um yesterday
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00001.flac	you know it's actually awsome because evelin's really really cool and some really cool people and i got to meet the guys who made
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00002.flac	these homeless guys who attack these this group of women and these group of girls and then this supernatural creature occurs at the highest the crochendow of the violence from man to man then the negative energy basiclly brings in a creature which has
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00003.flac	ehcause you know it was because you got to look at from an acting point of iew seeing where it went with with these different these different people the homelas guys and the girls but also because i wanted to explore where
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00004.flac	some supernatural creatuer wer come from and what whether you know whether thit draws a disparity between a good person and a bad person and whether like a gost or a creature would just kill everybody and i was like wher do that come from an i think it should come from negative energy that's kinda
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00005.flac	one of my best mates he's brilliant he's brilliant  as brynd fortune heas not a very good frind of mine a all three of us have worked together quite a
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00006.flac	cand toricsa sabova and nataely an vanesa and shevan so i got like five or six
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00007.flac	i don't need just use my own film itt as an example but what we tried to do was it's a bit of drama and it wil
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00008.flac	i don'tkned just use my own film witht as an example but what we tried to do was tire's a bit of drama in it wa relationships and tit's thot
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00009.flac	there's an ot for lot of times you see a brakedown of someone's human relationship and then something herrific happens and brings people together how they deal with a situationd struggle and you can a drama doesn' eally get that across all the time and the horror actually allows to see people  in these extrem circumstances and sees what people react to what they'll do
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00010.flac	it's the biggest influence i mean cause and also ros mary's babye's a very clever film cause than also looks at society and looks at trond wath the people and relationshps it's not just about a horro film it's it's an awful i
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00011.flac	thini'd like to make my films that way and think it's important that you can make entertainment and then also try and live something through it even if it's very suttle as someone takes it from  but yoea i think
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00012.flac	can explore i think it's important sometimes to explore nagative aspects of society and people's syces
id10293_Mp1IXRquJ9s_00013.flac	i'll put a number for  counceling on my webside and then if you wanna go to that person and then give out to me out
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00001.flac	i was i was really excited because i thought that paul had created a character that that it was really interesting to me and it was quite dark and quite layred um and then i went oh god resn't hevell i really wanna do
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00002.flac	for dock's character now i think what what paull does really cleverly is paul paull's actually kind of he understands the games in a way where that's whye he's able to create the world so well but he's done things sometimes he's created characters himself to fit for how he wants the movies to go which is what he did with alis and what he did with ih with my character so
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00003.flac	some moments just the moments when you're kinda like you know goan down some cardors and uh and you kinda goon i remember this and then something is jumping at at you'r g like ginning a little bit of ptst flashbacks being fifteen years old and in my
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00004.flac	night time a lot we shot in in the rain in the darkness we had two or three hundred
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00005.flac	there's a lot of there's a lot of coiograpy they made these great stuntguy naithon naithon baras or did a great job but at the same time when everything is suddenly coming at you  you're kind of a little bit like an lik god wha' hel wa's happening so there's moments when everythings there was these big fences and all dezonbies are trying to get through and you have a vage idea of where your mark's supposed to be but at the same time it's instinctual to just figure
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00006.flac	oni the we had we had one or two film things only because when you're doing stuff where you're jumping off
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00007.flac	riges and stuff ore kindaf rolling around you get the phone one but that was imore tan t you don't break the prop not about you they just don't have to fix the prop if you're in t
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00008.flac	i said o be stupid uh i just wanted to keep filming stuff whenever he called cut i s wanted to film everything tawas going
id10293_OMOpC0gi-gQ_00009.flac	tse onbi's like having a coffe and just talking about the weather and stuff yeah it's a bit you know the the atmosphere they create on set mela and paul have have a great energy about them and they just make it
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00001.flac	game consols i used to have al the old intendo and exbox and snars and then comador sixty four and all tho stoffs i've be i've been playing games and i used to play
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00002.flac	done to watch because it kinda has everything in it and as a movie i think for me i personally it's the best one and it it just tyes everything together so i think you can watch this movie if you haven't watch the other five and if you have whatch ohther five
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00003.flac	first one was like the start of of zambis coming back into kind of to movie making i think cause they had ta little bit
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00004.flac	not for me because i was just mean the movie the pressure 's all on melan on pall so for me i was just kinda doing my thing and just kinda you know just just being accepted by them hoping to kinda do a good job but it's afterwards yo en you realize how important it is to a lot of people
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00005.flac	do me good paull wrote the screat script i think melea is like the action star for me for like the last fifteen years ad and pall
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00006.flac	e they they just made me feel very welcom t it's a very uh it's a very chill vibe it's very intense because we're doing thes these crazy sequences and it's a crazy big set and they make it really chill and and paul and mela have their daughter ever in the movie as well and alie's been there for a while so it's a very nice
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00008.flac	th they they did stick up a couple of the crew with guns s i didn't wanna meet any the peopl who lived there figure that myt
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00009.flac	he he has this great way whereby he's doing these incredibly huge sequences he's got this whole movie mapped out in his head and he just makes it very chill i he i never saw him once gets dressed he just makes the whole thing very easy
id10293_SJxWXqMu2ds_00010.flac	it almost feels like cause what we're doing wis so hectic and so nots and turms of the schope for it to be so enjoyable and relaxed almost seems like a we're
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00001.flac	it up you know with tc being suspended so come back in the season too e he's still suspended at tho start
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00002.flac	to being brought up back into the hosputle he's he's also everyone's aware that he had a breakdown uh and he he ended up talking about a lot of his issues and going through trying to deal a lot of m wth georgean so t started this
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00003.flac	look after other people i instead of himself which is his way of dealing with his own deamons and exercising what's happened to him in the
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00004.flac	n he's very complex because there's also darkness to him which i think is what people connect to because everyone's got that kinda darkness
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00005.flac	to uh he's trying be hard to deal with that and to cope with all these things hafe happened to him from being in afganistan with his brother and that's hard and i think that's he's a very human character and he's uh
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00006.flac	i think all the characters really are really identifiable because they're all real they're all real people and you got it's the way that they've kind of created the characters like of drew and regosa and and tofer that they're real people tho kind of you care about and theyve got you know um
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00007.flac	t' it's always much easier when you come back to  the second season because you know everybody and so you can kindaf mess around with people more and you understand their foibles everyone has a different way
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00008.flac	and and you get each other an because en you don't even have to act anymore half the time because you're just yo'r like talking to your friends
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00009.flac	fabricating something it's like we understand each other we know who we are and everyone knows who the characters are so no one's everyone just kind of
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00010.flac	fun right but it's fun but there's also there's a lot of kindo humor to it but then it's quite energetic which i think is really important and it's quite real and all the characters
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00011.flac	sucked into something to dramatic all the time and that's kon of lightingd a little bit then it goes down again there's a lot of intensity to it so there's um there's a lot of kindaf energy with it and i think that's the fun thing about this show is because it's always got a good pase to it and that's what makes
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00012.flac	i thought i knew a little bit and i gout all these books to learn but we do some really really really interesting stuff like doing eckmos and all the all these things you wouldn't normally
id10293_TnOGBL8p-RM_00013.flac	so an e got people like john fong and who's worked in ear for years so you do learn about a lot of stuff they wouldn't know about otherwise which is
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00001.flac	the movie was ininitiation to be honst with you u the the very first day they they threw me on set and we had this big make you no three page scene and it's you know we're in this massive set and there's guns and i had to do all this dialog a mela and we had to kindaf get really
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00002.flac	great stunk guy called naitheon barris who's fantastic and did all like a lot of the s african shows such is dominion and stuff so he was he was really on top of it amd but they let me
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00003.flac	othe cool stuff like coming down off the off the uh the the gratings and off
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00004.flac	ad stuff and yeah he hes he was uh e altho most of unless i cames like very very very fine detaile stuff they let me do a lot of it but naithon was great because he oversaw
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00005.flac	you kindaf think i really wanna do these stunts and the why won't they let me do it and then you relize ah there's two onther people who if if i break my finger or hurt myself we have to change the scene so it's not about you know
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00006.flac	and she's beautiful right i mean i i remembern  i mean when you see me len fift element
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00007.flac	the original rezanevol she's she's beautiful and she's still beautiful and she's just the most wonderful person she's a wonderful actress nd i just i i
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00008.flac	creates that vib on set where she makes it you know everything's
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00009.flac	u don't get that too much i g i kind af yous get it when muchl going through uh going through airport security or going through imigration and
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00010.flac	you know and i i used to get really worried going through imigration in america cause you guys make it all very very serious and
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00011.flac	texting soe my buddies when i told them i was gonna be playing alie larder's love interest and they were quite jellous because
id10293_TwfthltapLg_00012.flac	lack a nightshift uh we start in about two months a i'm doing a movie with a buddy on mine in about three weeks uh
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00001.flac	there's onl some mediting at this top ind the tale of the film the rest of it as all shot sequentially from start to finish and
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00002.flac	but now he listens to me am i think everytime me and eat i direct him we have
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00003.flac	just explore that and you don't have to wary with other things and then because you understand each other's actors i know how to direct
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00004.flac	don it secuentially allowed people to be free and then see where their characters are going it wouldn'tave work
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00005.flac	that's the kinda highte of what man can do to  men and then i want to see
id10293_X7uOKQUYTCM_00006.flac	that was like what you're saying about keeping it sequential so when a i wante to just get real reaction so everything was very real so because we didn't i didn't lke i don't realylike todo
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00001.flac	dislike for what has happened and a and for himself he does not care the for tc most important
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00002.flac	eneeds to have an outlet to focus ons i think i think even though i think maybe because he is spending someone's time looking after other people he actually needs to be able to
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00003.flac	and i coul imagine be eu doing it in real life working for twelve to fourteen hours it would be stressfully
id10293__FHcnO0b5hE_00004.flac	following certain regulations heis frustrating for him because it takes time and and he doesn't like
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00001.flac	of a small group of rebls who are kind of just about bairely surviving in acon city and they're exausted and there's a lot of n inner fighting and and little factions developing and he's just about keeping together and along with claire redfield and he's uh the two of them are romantically intertwined and they're kindof just about surviving and dock is uh when mela or alis
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00002.flac	little reluctantly yeah well you know he he i think he kinda docklooks he's he's he's a reluctant leader in that he's looking after everybody but at the same time he's a
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00003.flac	it was quite humbling i  and  thend every made me feel very very special and a had a really nice time an it was a really nice group of people and i think that's important re doing a movie that's kind of that's this important it's the last one to franchise and it's this big you kind af wanna work with people
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00004.flac	you know and so o you know you're working long hours and it's difficult and it's tough but if you get on with people you know
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00005.flac	like we're gonna do this and you go that's that's you know they're better at than i am but if he can get away with
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00006.flac	ld or fourteen years old that's all that's kind of what being an actor is in your head right it's
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00007.flac	or these actors from southafrica who re who are made up as these amis and they um when you have a croude of a group of people at night time surrounded by fire and they're all done up as amis and their whole mandate is to try and kill
id10293_g2jVmC3qCNA_00008.flac	you know that can become a lttle bit freeky because i coming at you through the grating
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00001.flac	just really like an inspired by terya macman ma charldy cause he worked really hard i'm inspired by yo mom and for what she dolas now she works hard with my sisters everybody you know by my granny
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00002.flac	les question in the amount ofyou section have you ever had any funny encounters with
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00003.flac	quicker from all the places you went to what was your favorite place to shoot and why
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00004.flac	you find most actors if whend when you do a character you know part of it becomes you
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00005.flac	are you going to be directing staring and anymore movies or projects in he ne
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00006.flac	will you be reprising ou role as gen in season five this question is from locy wood
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00007.flac	great great that's wonderful i cannot wi wait for great i i for one i cannot wait
id10293_gegIAYxfpVA_00008.flac	i'm quite glad about that personally i'm quite glad next question do you like to travel and have you ever gone to any exotic places from elenar
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00001.flac	that that was a big accent shooting at nighttime which was you know i i thought new mexico was gonna be hot this is cold this is this is like as bad
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00002.flac	wh who wis the the business eimen of the episode or of the of the hospital um and then
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00003.flac	and this incident with the little boy in the car acident is the
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00004.flac	the motivating  factr which kind of starts a lot of the clash between the two of them and then jeordein is kind of the the counter point between altha
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00005.flac	h you know udo yu have to treat it as a business or what so that's kind of that's the fundamental core of this episode
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00006.flac	in comnbad situations an dealing with life and death situations if you got somebody in a suit telling yhou what to do you don't wanna listen to that you don't listen to anybody in a sut telig hm wht to do anybody but uh so i thenkt that's that's the fundemental reason why they don't get on and then ragosas telling tc what to do and tc doesn't agree with hem because for tc it's about saving lives and you know to hell wath everything else but rigosa has to treat it
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00007.flac	because george's there now she's engaged and so you got the whole xuh you know girlfriend boyfriend type thing onon and they clash a lot but they still carry about each
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00008.flac	uh late at night you're gona get everything right because you're gona get alle gunshot bovictoms you're gonna get people whov been in in high intense accidents and a lot of that stuff happens at night time right i mean that that's realistic the e when yo get a lot of bad accidents people are tired you got drunk drivers with all that stuff and you're also gonna get the very you're gonna get the dregs of society all the way to top so it's gonna be i think a whole vast spectrum but it's all the um i think it's some of the
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00009.flac	the characters have to aproach it the same way cause life is too short and i think if you see people who are dying in front of you well then you know you gotta find the humor in it eventually and you gotta find the humor and everything else around you otherwise you know life's too morbide and morrose
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00010.flac	play some pool shoot some hoop and just you know chillout and just get away from everything
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00011.flac	see all these heart and lungs and john does this great job or by there's these perfect replicas of like an open heart surgery of like someone's spine and so and it's really cool and your seeng like all this kind of weird jam
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00012.flac	the nice it's essentially um it's kindaf like mash meets iguess in the hospitl so it's it's a a more high actingn version of of a of a doctor show it's not like anything iever ever watched
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00013.flac	it's very different because you're dealing n off a lot a with with the nightshift which is got very different type of of senaros in kew whaut happen n the day shift ou a houspul wich i wasn't aware aout ntill i did it um
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00014.flac	so it' it's it's got this great uh mixture of um of drama of
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00015.flac	res and so forthm married to this uh this kind of
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00016.flac	army situation because you have allis you know thelred to to the army and so in that you kno in that situation t's a nice bit a comedy to it like mash there's a lot of
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00017.flac	um i play a character called tc calahan who is uh an ex arme medic who's in afganistan with with
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00018.flac	tc you know he he he suffered an awful lot from when he wasn
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00019.flac	so tc is is suffering off a lot from having been in afganistan and now he's working in the ar and the reason why he works in the yar and the night shift is because it still gives him that
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00020.flac	dud who's very quick to anger but he's a very very very smart doctor but he just does not like being told what to do so he likes doing things his own way
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00021.flac	the character of tc is someone who's been in the army but has always found it difficult to follow orders directly cuse he's always tried to do his own thing and that actually lead to him being um being
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00022.flac	t of the arme essentially because he wasn't always following direct orders so in the ard tc i's a little it of a mabveric in terms of he understands how to do things and he doesn't usually wait to be told what to do he'll just do it
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00023.flac	as well but tc is always the one tho'll kinda go out and kind of um uh and tofer the the ones who'l go out into the environment to wi with  restc halli captor to bring people in and they leave the ear an alfelatt kind of bring in patients who are in trouble and self which they do they don't just stay in
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00024.flac	yeah i think pretty pretty much every episode so far thereis there's a big event and that's what's
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00025.flac	iit's interesting ther's a lot of there's a lot of intensity in a lot of high actor ing drama going on but it's still got this this lovely sense of pace and this this nice uh
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00026.flac	n becuse when mom's actually wat beif she actualy was teaching and prety nursing myju
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00027.flac	i took over her course wat my dad was sick for three or four months so i've actually taught this stuff
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00028.flac	it's not the kind of usual date of type stuff um but also because of the sinaris it can create with
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00029.flac	in to the army and soforth and everything that goes on at night time it's like that old idea that you knowen there's a full moon weird stuff happens right so at night time weirder stuff seems to happen in a hospital cause that's wen al the crazies come in so it's already got the that extra element of of craziness attached to it and you got all thi stuff with the army which is a very interesting dinamic and you got these army doctors so everything is more intense and they've kinda dealt with death and a different level
id10293_k1jiAINXHRI_00030.flac	it's also it's qui it's like mash you know i mean and mash has been around for a long time so it's got that comedy with a lot of drama with a lot of action so it's there's a lot of
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00001.flac	show's not really like crazing tat do mean an youare because um doyu rmembwr them do yu remember the show mash from the eighties i love mash rig
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00002.flac	dou rmeber the dou rmebr the show mash from the eightes i love mash right and and this show's more its more kind of assoc iated with that because we'v got the kind of military aspect there's also a lot of kind of black humor in our show which is different so grats anadamy in ande or which are great shows but they're more dramatic tan aurs has the drama but it's got these different elements so it's actually quite different
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00003.flac	the interesting thing is because he's always on the edge because he's been to war and he suffers om
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00004.flac	an a real guy a real character and then uh we've a lot of military people working with the show so um and it's a military hospital and so all the cases are stuff that actually happens and i think that's what also makes the show i
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00005.flac	kind of element to it in terms of all the cases and hipor realism and i think that's
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00006.flac	a you say it is a bit chaotic and a bit aximn's y it's fun but we we have we have two doctors who work on the set all the time
id10293_l3J1f06Slfo_00007.flac	and my ant as a doctor so i spent some time with them and i bought a lote of books i bought loads of books and i didn't read them but i i have them there so it makes me feel
id10293_mNM0rMPJE10_00001.flac	and and i think it's it's it's interesting wheter that wetter medicon an looking after somebody does become an actual business and takes away from the  motiv human aspect of it and that's kinda what the two fight against because tc just wants to save people and doesn't really care about you know businessi and authourity and all that kind a stuff and georgen does and she needs to look after the actual you know the paper work and the business aspect of it because otherwise the hospital will not work and then whencs it doesn't work then
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00001.flac	he kindof does his own thing which is incredibly attractive to play as a
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00002.flac	n it's incredibly dractive to watch cause you're watching someone which is um i think it makes you comfortable to watch som'ebody who doesn't really care because you don't kindaf worry about  then that way
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00003.flac	it it feeds his own feelings of guilt so he has to so every single person that comes in
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00004.flac	saving somebody's life because it was almost like saving ther on life is so it's almost like um saving part of his past because  things have happened to him
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00005.flac	body or you know somebody who is so hel bent on doing the right thing andand so hel bent on helping someone else or they're just incredibly certain about what they wanna do that you auhtamatically want to support them in that ad i think that's what it is and he's just
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00006.flac	ordan alexander and that is am a very distructive relationship buting more so for jeordan than e ones forh tc and i think actually for tc
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00007.flac	k in lov his africtions and problems and and so forth and he
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00008.flac	and i've i've heard from a lot of people friends of mine that they y you don't often get that and the same is on this show is that we just happen to have this really great group of people  where by everyone h the way they castit and put it together is is is really interesting because
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00009.flac	yeah i think so  thing it helps c i think um the most important thing i i think with acting is that you trust the other persons
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00010.flac	fom curve and danny was the guy who um when is di
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00011.flac	and about acting and so  when i was studiing so studing mysmen and then me and myself and danny started making
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00012.flac	we are on screen which is really weird because ken is very um ken is very sin and he's got this
id10293_nAtqrkWKIhM_00013.flac	get to to act with this character which has been given to me by virtue of what the character
id10293_r4aP67VNNrc_00001.flac	ithink just a few people know i am but everyone's really sweet and everyone's like you know and it's nice om peoplen actually um
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00001.flac	do a lot of post production makeshifs a perfect but it o its takes a bit of a year anyway
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00002.flac	it's very very differntit it's a very kind of um it'sa very sreal place i mean i was there reating e for about two or three months i kinda really enjoyed it and i hotd a lot of very interesting people but it's kind of
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00003.flac	because evron's in this kind of very very con sorta buble of kind of and it's just all about kind of act you no le kinda getting there n being on tv and being on film it
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00004.flac	yeh ijust got very lucky and i actuall just met somebody in london wh actually wo was in ala and then i went over down to meet them and then it was kming  was actaly wene o thespir f the monme things tat i go for two weeks if i meet somebody great and then i just did and then i met a a men a manager and company met an agent and the and i just
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00005.flac	o some stuff i'd done i just done studs i had a few bits ind pieces and i did somei did a few monaloges for them and then they
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00006.flac	oan wilson abet before the wedding crashes and he doesn't actually like on wilson and he tell aan wilson was
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00007.flac	pacxtn kind of raneriso and mark walberg so he's kind of he knows a lot of people and he kinda knows
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00008.flac	and then basi he's very privates about eight people of class and then kind of he
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00009.flac	woldn' put a time lime on it but i kind a think i just gonna do it as long as i'm enjoying it and than i kind of mee really interesting people i kindaf meanit's going along quite well so i mean if it goes out well
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00010.flac	well i i directed a film which im kind of ums impost production at the moment so
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00011.flac	l done an juster by mid mid summer next year but that was ah that was a big experience i just loved
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00012.flac	the jemison film festival i mean they're met them badnow have  got to stud sting they're great because they're kind a really helpful to people who wannto get involed in the film so the competition uh the idea is basically anybody
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00013.flac	and on any mediom any formot and basically ghot to submite a sixty second advertisement for
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00014.flac	is if the winner which t be think the entries are gonna be in by twenty fourth of january and the winner gets three thousand you know pluss gets a film shown in the film festival and then also i think they kindaf maybe transcribed on to thirty five militer
id10293_rZQMeH1FCvM_00015.flac	sooting straght after christmas uh some stuff with jane hend i got to do a few pickups in posession and then i
id10293_uYi5KwUCqGU_00001.flac	you see every all the big parts and everyhingyu have to adition for it and usually you might do a tape and the you go t go in
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00001.flac	o like uh uh fit in properly because i i i loved the movies and i i i love t computer games si wanted to do it justice but um it was paollemena ma made it very easy you know paull gave me the room and and the space to kindaf explore the character that i wanted to and and work ith mela was just it was
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00002.flac	so it just makes everything nice and simple you know so there's no thite was a very calm it's a very intense shooting scheduale and a very intense set but it's very calmyou
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00003.flac	do that much sedi thinke the vast majorit well i mean there there's there's obviously a bit in terms of einhansing still but the vast majority was paul wanted to go back to shooting the way yheu would with everything in camera so he had all these kind af really crazy locations like there's jis u if you remember the they're really
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00004.flac	that's all that's all like that's not a set that's all this big building of johanasberg it's n erly it's
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00005.flac	s thrty stories away and and none of that cj and all the sets they built and they or not they built they they would find these video buildings reck them and then kind of create the set in there so a lot of it is just
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00006.flac	an i ih that's again i've still got this memory which which won't leave me which is because when i f played the
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00007.flac	hrough tha blody house and you have to open doors and then some jums i and you just do on to and even when you know you have
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00008.flac	and you just do on to and even when you know you have to open the door and you know wher the thing is gonna come from bit just still it gets you every time that was my very first memory of rezan evil in
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00009.flac	he gave me a lot of scope to kind o i mean paull had very very interesting ideas of this character anyway so it was kind of easy for me to come in and go cool im um he knew what he wanted fom the character
id10293_vD3qGRbmXws_00010.flac	but he he allowed me the freedom to kind a just play with stuff and he trusted me because we shot a lot of it sequentially so it was like okay we're gonna this is where i want the character to go to the end so he had to kind a trust me to let me play it that way until we got to that part
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00001.flac	so they sent a telegram to spain saying from now on we want capinancdidwe to have an eipatch
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00002.flac	you have to look at people at normal people who were suad to go along with hout
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00003.flac	not only that it it does a dis service to those who study history you learn nothing from
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00004.flac	you only learned from how was it possible for that machinery to convince otherwise good and normal people my father only remembers a good man but he was very convinsed of it between thirty three and thirty
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00005.flac	so the question of antisematism and all that that came up u but there was a
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00006.flac	majer issue for hitlar but for jerman's a side issue not important wat was important they had food on their table and suddenly jermeny was recognized again a
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00007.flac	where they show nothing but these characature nutes they have contributed nothing to the
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00008.flac	the reality in north africa was that rummel faught with a small group against a entire british eighth armey and beat the crap out of most of them most of the time that was the reality rapito turned that around people often asked me what do you what do you think about i sai 's
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00009.flac	what all those series did rapetrove combat
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00010.flac	listen to what i'm saying it's very important because i feel that that feeling of omnipotence was created by
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00011.flac	the reality of the second world war was that the rusians contributed enormously decisively
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00012.flac	bi morro and chris george and verious people
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00013.flac	that wart the hardest most terrible war in the history
id10294_1l9B0dz7gjc_00014.flac	because hollywood ha contributed to the notion that we allone one that
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00001.flac	again because of this the appetite of day time is so enormous it's so averitcious it's it it just eats you up unless you gain the right
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00002.flac	and she said why don't you use this as a challenge and
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00003.flac	but they said no no there's written in stone you can't change anything i said you must be
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00004.flac	and then wet west kinney came the producer of west kinne and he's the reason i
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00005.flac	this doesn't make any sense how about changing is a downright
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00006.flac	and bill knew i'd change somethings but he never let it be
id10294_3BRezdwX-4I_00007.flac	and i never changed characters or whatever or nothing like that but
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00001.flac	and she asked me i was a rather misteriously wealthy character but no one knew exactly what my background
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00002.flac	was taken away to be ansere with  i was really uh was just
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00003.flac	when you do a film or when you gantim television because you're more isolated you you don't realize the efect
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00004.flac	but applie to anyone who does nighttime or theater or film the difference is they don't go out enough
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00005.flac	i did not realize that what i did made a difference to some people and this medium and i'm eternally grateful to it
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00006.flac	i i have always been very welcomingu anyone who clame as different
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00007.flac	not telling the truth i've always welcomed actors coming into uh the situation
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00008.flac	and i'm i'm very supportive especially of young actors because i know what a
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00009.flac	and you're exposing yourself right there frunt of everyone to judge you
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00010.flac	stugh so iv always been very supportive of actors
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00011.flac	once i'm finished with him younove lost his family his house his
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00012.flac	u te makes i degand i can't do a sceen for very long we start laghring
id10294_49XYNpeN23I_00013.flac	comes from a very brighth family and and therefore he's a great sens of humor and we just laugh a lot he's a
id10294_GzajCggf7-8_00001.flac	ned a lot of german actors to be in american television programs
id10294_JUyxHgPHR-s_00001.flac	gaban macclouwd was with the same agency i'd been with so i knew these
id10294_JUyxHgPHR-s_00002.flac	i played a uh a por simon character remember that that very synical
id10294_Jr2KDTTWYgM_00001.flac	uhone of my most um favorite memories i love that show i loved everyone
id10294_Jr2KDTTWYgM_00002.flac	shows john manly was the executore poducer and he was a hell of a
id10294_Jr2KDTTWYgM_00003.flac	and dark all those pofesters they ere wonderful people very nice people
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00001.flac	we badly need taxes when you go to amstardam for example you go to where the stoners hang out in amsterdam you almost never see a fight break out if you go to the bars in england or scotland or jermany fights break out all the time
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00002.flac	you know there was alcohaoll to induse this vialant behavior i've never known a stoner
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00003.flac	we have three hundred seventeen million people across the borders from canada and mexico every year hundred
id10294_KMM3INYWEeY_00004.flac	they have found very little diliterious about pop and if for example someone is found driving a car under the influence
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00001.flac	so i looked across the street and there was restone rol
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00002.flac	thought well i can do that so i went and they applied they had a job the next
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00003.flac	scannia was one of the restaurants in town at the time on sansa bulavard and the coner agency the pa conagent is diagnally across so they came to lunch there sometimes so i got to talking to waldor conner who came with a scarn bababab he is where you frind as an
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00004.flac	they need a lot of jrman young droman actors now for  series like like galant men
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00005.flac	simply as a means of making money at first so they asked me to read something and i did and i was very good at it and the first interview i went to was for a dreadful film called operation ihman the isrelis the mosada just caught eitof iheman an
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00006.flac	went home but i h'd never been on a film studio before never acted before never seen a script before so they kept on sending me blue pages yello pages pink pages an the what teel is this
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00007.flac	i was an hour and a half late i was in the first scenes so i remember coming finally to the gate they rushed
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00008.flac	this is weird so now i come onto the set u cameras and all that had never seen any of that before in my
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00009.flac	so the director came i forget the director's name and he said you know when werner comes out he walks up here and you walk this way then you meet at the
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00010.flac	a very kind sweet soul that looked at me and knew i was
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00011.flac	i literally frose they said cat but it wasn't because of me was because something whent ron
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00012.flac	i said no sheus you have to say this so fortunately i'm
id10294_L812MIi7ruk_00013.flac	and twenty minutes later i had it obviously and they were readyi took twenty minutes for them to prepare
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00001.flac	and um always warm always embracing always understanding the character you
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00002.flac	i never really felt that you would have to talk to audiences away from me because when i've encountered them
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00003.flac	it's been nothing but just an outporing of warmth and emotion and and and i've never
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00004.flac	what's ilustrated  an artical about this character where the interview
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00005.flac	e hurns and the raders and basketball and what the male players liked is the fact that victor nema doesn't take any
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00006.flac	there was an artical recently that came out about prisoners it's their favorite character because he doesn't take any
id10294_NRMQOFYS41I_00007.flac	so it's more complex then then they love to hate that's it's more complex than that
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00001.flac	atitude simply is that he will not be dictated to by a woman but he will not be dicative
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00002.flac	conversely i as a man don't have the right to talk
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00003.flac	it's a question of mutual respect between the
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00004.flac	and then you have suddenly the woman making an ausse of the man ain't gonna happen t
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00005.flac	in the rorlo sports you don't bush it you don't say someone hey you ba b ba bab
id10294_OiRXHy35Euk_00006.flac	as soon as ther are feelings of omnipotence as soon as as a man or as a woman you walk around  as well when i throw my reate around
id10294_PfQFgX_pBfU_00001.flac	always played the bad guy and i was tired of that to be honest with you but very grateful to
id10294_PfQFgX_pBfU_00002.flac	hollywood hundred fifty thousand of which one percent
id10294_TsdCaeLEoOU_00001.flac	to approach me as erick braiden you know and sometimes in the moment of passionat
id10294_VPcqW7TXwkw_00001.flac	so then four weeks later they asked me to please please please james cameran wanted to see me on
id10294_VPcqW7TXwkw_00002.flac	i said why he says why do you say it's gonna be successful i said this because it's a sobabra and i know something about sobabras it's a very
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00001.flac	i have nothing more interesting to do in other wards if i ever had enough courage to direct my
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00002.flac	with the name hunt scholy guys was proud of it i'm still proud of it but o wasn't
id10294_VweNonqOdrE_00003.flac	meaning the contributions of german imigrants tof this country have been overwhelming

id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00002.flac	you youvoke something of the audience whatever that is
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00003.flac	i and i think that is what people are partly attracted to in this character he's vulnerable he's not only tough and hard he's
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00004.flac	they part very vociferously very passionately very never
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00005.flac	kind of hostile and seemingly ereconscilable
id10294_a4msZPEjhMc_00006.flac	parting to overcome that again i i i you know there's some relationships like that you know it's i mean think of richard burtain and elizabeth tayler for example i mean it's it's

id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00004.flac	and hors boohes they have played nothing but noses and
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00005.flac	so i took the first part of the british i came from in jermany called bradenbeg
id10294_ba0ZhyVTodw_00006.flac	i imagine how unsettling this is a new name suddenly the most powerful man in town stops at your table and says helow
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00001.flac	melody tommas sgod who was very quick very quick study great sense
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00002.flac	and of course what is the essence of what we do is to make something that someone else wrote real
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00003.flac	you know what's the most difficult is to do those simple scenes
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00004.flac	i think i don't actually know how i learn i i don't i still don't know i think i
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00005.flac	and i was always very cavalear about learning my dialogue because i learned very quickly
id10294_dYC_mN16I_k_00006.flac	w used all kinds of baseball tumanology i know nothing about basebal and mathamatical

id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00001.flac	and theres certain issues i obviously didn't discus but most of it
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00002.flac	is responsible for that part of jermany
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00003.flac	that whole period should remind people of the importance of understanding what
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00004.flac	abrige certain freedoms they won't get away with it because the found foundational rock of this country
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00005.flac	do a screen test at universa studios i did and go back to
id10294_gETtCLtu1jA_00006.flac	tok me sort of callmed me down and said you know you've always said you want to get out

id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00002.flac	can we somehow assine something to the background of the
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00003.flac	where nicke melay tomas scot never knew anything about my past and she asks me some
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00004.flac	he gave this man a background where he was left in an orfhenage at the age of seven by his parents destedood parents the moment i played that
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00005.flac	i knew i was gonna stay because a'd humanized
id10294_nkIdfM2BFS0_00006.flac	i said youow my mother you might be an imposter and imposter have to
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00001.flac	and yet the writers in daytime have a very difficult task because they need to write so
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00002.flac	that is one thing i learned on the show by doing public appearances every
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00003.flac	in the provences in the stiks of canada and of america and the south and the north and the west and these everywhere small towns um
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00004.flac	there's a condecention in the hollywood towards that unwashed audience my as
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00005.flac	you change your mind about that you become more modest about it and you become far more
id10294_oTRparDs-84_00006.flac	can tell you stories till the cows come in we won't do that but it's enormous no
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00001.flac	an kimhunter and i didn't see much of them they were very nice of course i felt very sorry for them because they had to be in the makeup room ath
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00002.flac	uh given by directors or producers never i would i'm to arogant for that i never wanted to evoke the impression that i was there to
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00003.flac	because i havd known a lot of actors who knew a lot of people in this business and never gott work because in the end it's a business they don't give a ship whether you live on the moon or not they want you to perform and that's it
id10294_zIkTBKfnbso_00004.flac	so they said well we have a pingpong tournament i said i'm in anything with sports so it was part of the tournament where walter
id10295_2NX7pAXpu5U_00001.flac	you knowbrant and westbrook an thunder and and you know it's just fun it's fun it's a good time to be a
id10295_3KnwlyXVpv4_00001.flac	take that seriously i'm not i'm you know n the show i'm on now i uh u within five seasons i'll be three hundred and ten pounds with a meetball in one hand and a bagget in the other sitting at the helm bark
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00001.flac	san francisco and los angeles are are seperated by about four hundred miles but they couldn't be worlds apart you know
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00002.flac	i i ha i was a water poller player in high school and my season ended short and i ended up uh getting wroped into doing a play uh joke uh played joke keler and all my sons the great arther miller
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00003.flac	and i said this is what i wanna do with the rest of my life so i just i i moved down ta
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00004.flac	well it's about uh you know a global pandemic and a ship that's left out uh in the open water that hasn't been touched by the viris yet and it's their job to try to create a vackcene and and save the world we get uh sort of
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00005.flac	and uh when we get back to the states we realize there's really nothing left there for us so it's uh
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00006.flac	you know us against the the rest of the world and some of the government militaries have gone rogue and um we have to stop at guantana obay to pick up food and fuol it's um it's a pretty interesting premis and uh it's a very exciting show you know m thirty years ago this would h've been considered sience fiction now it's highly probable which is somene
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00007.flac	it's very very accurate you know and and we worked very closely with the united states naviy on this michael bey has a great relationship with the department of defense in the united states
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00008.flac	um we couldn't've made this show without him and we have their full support we also had great technical advisers and leazons from the naviy on set with us every day making sure that we were depicting the lives of these people as acurately as possible ind the circumstances that we were in so
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00009.flac	uh as accurate a uh portraal of u an end of days sort of senario or or an apocholips uh based on a a a an outbreak of a virous as
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00010.flac	and i missed the guys that i was working with um i spent seven years of my life with them i spent
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00011.flac	you know just as much time with them as i did with my family and i miss hem and congradulations to them for for
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00012.flac	i continued success that show just doesn't stop uh but i had a great time working on that show and i wished them all the
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00013.flac	i had a fan that at while i was at the indianapolis five hundred with dempsy um
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00014.flac	um run up to me and and latch onto me um and aske me for a picture and i said sure i'll take a picture um but she had nobody with her to take the picture so she just started screaming out to any random person um to take
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00015.flac	uh and and it literally it was like a five minute embrace i didn't know what to do somebody
id10295_3tvnlmkCiTw_00016.flac	now i'm teaching my oldest and my youngest to swim so we spend a lot of time in the pool but i'm a homebody i spend a lot of time at home with them and you know i'm at work a lot so when i'm not working i like to uh i like to stay around the house and and and hang out with
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00001.flac	i haven't entirely gotten used to it yet i actually didn't even know that i was refered to as micksteme until my wife saw the episode and told
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00002.flac	they had a scene that that they had marked up for the reading that i read nd it it didn't say anything about micstme but nothing bad has come of it
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00003.flac	so i'd tyy it off and i'd let my hands go and and throw caush into the wind and and see what happens thit could be very uncomfortable on a set in front of forty fifty people on a beach it's differentt on a set when everybody else is fully
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00004.flac	before they get to the boring creduts and and and things of that nature i just put i look great with my
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00005.flac	uh les an acting lesson ther th the director was the only one on the set allowed to yell cut and i would do these scenes and it was my first
id10295_D8jV1M4V6UQ_00006.flac	te intereting thing was they didn't they didn't even have you know usually you have an elvisom person there that you can take pictures with  after to create more memories and uh all we had was a an elvas statue and it looked like they just riped off a bob's big boy and
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00001.flac	do spend uh significant amount of time in the jim but uh i've always done that it just makes me feel good i like to stay
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00002.flac	yeah i don't you know i don't i don't i i think for this character i think it kinda works to play against all of that
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00003.flac	and i i i play against all the beats that are obvious and support that because i think there's more to
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00004.flac	you know you don't spend a lot of time with the character and it's it's not
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00005.flac	ththe sychi psychiatrist  you don't really get to uncover what makes this person tak you know in one fell swoop it's sort of
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00006.flac	uh coreve walks in with with her and i asked him if it was bring a hopt blond a workday that was my
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00007.flac	cause the doctors at the hospital are so ugly we have to bring in gorgious guest stars to create a balanc
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00008.flac	was a pretty formedable guest star i think she did like six six seven well how many
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00009.flac	recognized a lot in france i was in france over the summer and that was weird
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00010.flac	you know to get recognized in another country is you know asside from the fact that they're recognizing you with an accent it's it's kinda something else
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00011.flac	i think nine million people watch grays ingattame a week in france that's a lot of
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00012.flac	you know i didn't know we reached out that far now you know i gues season three in jepan that's about as far as it
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00013.flac	yeah i get asked to sa our fans are very sane you know we a
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00014.flac	portive and they're just uh generally interested in in the show and the the
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00015.flac	rcrazy about him so i i certainly have no problem taking a
id10295_K1gPy1UKmBE_00016.flac	season three and i don't know if you guys have seen it yet but you will
id10295_NLyQte6Mhj0_00001.flac	i didn't play rugbey i was ik a lot lighter i wen i was a water poller player which is kinda rugbey
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00001.flac	leaving the guy a one dimentional character um because then you kinda
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00002.flac	uh the the one thing i wanted to do was make sure that he wasn't the antagonist at the end of the film you should be sort of torn
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00003.flac	and i wanted to make this guy's motives for taking over this club sort of
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00004.flac	the decetful undermining skem to snatch up this club so that i can
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00005.flac	you slip into habits because the way these things are written sometimes it's very
id10295_NZvythQO-SM_00006.flac	so you just have to stay i just had to stay on my toes and and make sure that i wasn't sort of hitting the stereo tipical beats of the and
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00001.flac	father likes to say you know you put your pants on the same way i
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00002.flac	its a little anoying sometimes but i have to stop and say okay this is my mom you know you want fifty signe head shots i'll get him
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00003.flac	she loves it she goes out and biyes like you know if if i d cover a tv guy tor something she goes upt and buyes ten
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00004.flac	and then she shows them to me when i go home like i haven't seen them before she's like look at you
id10295_NkqrS8yJOL0_00005.flac	she ets angiety she needs to be like sedated before she gets in the chair i have the greatest dentist
id10295_OCO9SWN7EOQ_00001.flac	tree billion dollars set to use and it wasn't at our disposal as much as we would
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00001.flac	yeah rabecka was convinced we were having a boy i said great well name her after my father
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00002.flac	and uh when we found out it was a girl i said great we'll name er after my father
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00003.flac	i think probably yeah i think we woul we would have to have him living
id10295_S9FeIMntmUE_00004.flac	bu you know i think the first episode is kindaf business as usual and then we slowly sort of ogress and and and deal with
id10295_WZ3jbVwrmS8_00001.flac	but i'm sure it was great i have a picture of it and i and i always tell people i met william mcove ho was a great guy but you're
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00001.flac	it is my first time in sweeden i have never been to stockhome and it is absolutely
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00002.flac	i'm so sorry mam i apologize it's my apology the look the watters on me i'm at
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00003.flac	well um i like to do everything with them theyi'r young my wife uh we've been married

id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00006.flac	i i sort of my life outside of atti wase it makes my life so good bot my professional life
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00007.flac	you know i've been quite successful over the past ten fifteen years and i've been very fortunate to be able to work in that
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00008.flac	and the characters you play that you put up on the screen are the people you bring home with you if that makes sense
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00009.flac	for sure for sure and you know depending i mean  a lot of the famous people are not as interesting as you would
id10295_WxDEVkQKPow_00010.flac	makes i always i always say fan makes good
id10295_iVxjBZtQwBg_00001.flac	apples and oranges you know if i'm riding to work i like to be in a car just because i like the quiet that you're afforded
id10295_iVxjBZtQwBg_00002.flac	in an autemobeel but uh on the weekends when i just kindaf wanna relax and go do my thing and not have any sort of
id10295_iVxjBZtQwBg_00003.flac	i ride with a couple of friends we go out to pcach up pcach to alter
id10295_kTLpYHUNf5A_00001.flac	it's very easy he's very he's much funnier than i am so any time he makes a suggestion hou
id10295_kTLpYHUNf5A_00002.flac	h and it's uh he knows what he wants it's it's it's fun it's like
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00001.flac	when you spend fifteen hours you know  maybe sometimes fifty hours per episode with somebody you don't really find it necessary to spend time with them outside of that
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00002.flac	we got seporated we had a we you know cause  there's five hundred thousand people in indianapolis and you know patric and i walking through their got a little dodgy sometimes but it was fun um and i got seporated from this whole group of people that we were walking with
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00003.flac	that's so big and she goes oh my god you have to get a l i take a picture take a
id10295_nt7dNRvlEHE_00004.flac	aand i thought maybe i was looking around to find out who had the camera she nobody she wasn't with anybody nobody had a camera she was just screaming

id10295_vHpJ0TSVKZs_00002.flac	uh and once you put on the uniform and and you sit in the captain's chair it's uh it
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00001.flac	last week because like i you know and it's it's i in in in you know looking back hindsite as twenty twenty i i figured out you know if i were expecting something like that i would have seen it coming but i didn't know until the host opened the door and she pushed me into a room filled with all my friends that it was actually happening which was kinda nice o
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00002.flac	tdo i frose for a little bit and then i started seeing you know recognizable faces and then you wonder what they're all doing in the same spot i realized well this is for
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00003.flac	a month for the first went to monty carlo in london i did some promotion for the show and then we went to paris
id10295_w9jwTc5wuV4_00004.flac	whe are kids y i that's the back oll it's thth and uh you know because
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00001.flac	season four was kind of a you know a throwback to the the original graze which was you know a year before
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00002.flac	i didn't i think i still have a shot i think u u invitation's still open so we'll see if i take it or not but uh yeah i felt a little
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00003.flac	dedicated to isolating mark slone at the end of the season leaving him with just
id10295_ywZWrIt52KQ_00004.flac	we i i personally love katy we have a great
id10296_0mOnLGSG2jM_00001.flac	well yeah i mean uh it's hard to it's hard to talk about a show like this and not give too much away but but basically um the future of america and this i now this is hard to buy
id10296_0mOnLGSG2jM_00002.flac	at the last minut before they di take over their body like jumping into a car before it goes off a clif and then we live their lives and it's it's a one way ticket we're not going back to the future
id10296_0mOnLGSG2jM_00003.flac	by uh premise and some of the missions that we are here to take care of was we're some of what we
id10296_2btSCK00syA_00001.flac	i used to i remember the firs time i wasinterviewed by people magasine i they asked me something about
id10296_5K8DAWq6wJc_00001.flac	od some clips just now to a a packed room of like four thousand people and the reaction was what we've seen all along which ish the film is ver
id10296_5K8DAWq6wJc_00002.flac	purity and i think so much of o sifi uh these days and then
id10296_8X8huGiBRAc_00001.flac	uh well paris which which is what happens to orne night it's a very exciting episode but i let's be honest we couldn't shoot in paris all season
id10296_8X8huGiBRAc_00002.flac	oinghe an that's what happens in paris and uh and it's uh but but because he en
id10296_CdDxsQV7RJM_00001.flac	as developed in ways i didn't i didn't nasulyusuee coming u while and
id10296_CdDxsQV7RJM_00002.flac	it's a crimesolving show and i think it's gonna be a great fit on aleb um
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00001.flac	but um i was thirty five when i got wilnagrace so i mean it's
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00002.flac	souh while i was working i was never famous i never you know i i i
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00003.flac	ersan okay years but i i i did a lot of guesst star stuff i did a lot of
id10296_DKDZ6ENKX0o_00004.flac	if you have to do it but i i don't know i one thingi would say is don't put all your egs in one basket uh don't find
id10296_KPKQZjynKsg_00001.flac	xplode o their own images but for me cidney polic tha that was one of the earliest ones where we weren't thinking we were on a show that
id10296_KPKQZjynKsg_00002.flac	and and then he showed up david our uh our producer said davi sine pallik i's plying you
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00001.flac	explore more of that i mean i think that we start the second season with him on his
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00002.flac	so i don't know how long that's gonna last but uh it certainly willu lend itself to to connecting more with
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00003.flac	uh with people uh on a romantic level um not sure but i think there's gonna be a little more
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00004.flac	we're gonn get to now both both now now that we've established the show and how and the endgin of the show i think we will sertnly get to know
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00005.flac	helps not just solve a crime but helps him deal with life it is his
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00006.flac	responded to this relationship uh the way they they they loved i mean the the show is very complex the writers the writer's
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00007.flac	last episode of the season i i've watched it four times i was in itand i'm still going wild this this
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00008.flac	py attention and they seem to be reacting well to you knowfor us not talking down to them but but you know writing to a a very smart
id10296_LUFoMNPpdbY_00009.flac	kwe had we ao where there's an episode that was u about religion and about tat and we have a great
id10296_OVqjDafJiGQ_00001.flac	uh well paris which which is what happens to ore night it's a very exciting episode but i let's be honest we couldn't shoot in paris all season
id10296_OVqjDafJiGQ_00002.flac	mea that's what happens in paris and uh and it's uh but but because
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00001.flac	uhmovie other week with roma downe and uh we've stayed we've stayed in touch and and for many
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00002.flac	he's a funny guy he's he's a guy that his that's gets everything he wants uh until until this happens and then it all starts to fall apart so when uh when benson and stablor first meet him he's
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00003.flac	i love i'm in my forties and i think all guys then in ther md forties are trying to keep u
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00004.flac	wth music and what's going on h with the culture and with technology and thi this is a guy that that's doing it he's he's in there he's dating young women he's made his fortuone with the the latest conning edge technology i'm none of those things but it was a nice streatch for
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00005.flac	clearly very welcoming i i can't i can't think of another set that i'd rather be on at this point i i hope i i hope
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00006.flac	in a show like this any of the law and orders sometimes the guest stars get the greatest stugf to do because they gotta solve the crimes we we get to commit them so it
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00007.flac	all of them these two characters in particular have had the most from what i've seen
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00008.flac	u mrisha and and chrisi's characters we we've met the other people on their lives we've seen their pain so we get so when they have an episode where it's more about the guest stars we still know the their backstories and  i think it helps to make them
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00009.flac	i think what makes television shows last a long time is is chemistry i mean the the scripts can be great if if you're not really jibing it can only the love can only go so far i think people really dig uh cris and marishca together um i think women are are obviously attracted to him but they'reare really attracted to her as as a as a role model and i think the the nature of these stories
id10296_SKwsA_nq1P8_00010.flac	just uh solving the crime the crime gets us in the gut every time because it is it is about victims it is about women almost always and uh we all have sisters and and
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00001.flac	the the casting is everything commeraters is  is everything you can have great writing an that never gets realized if if the if there isn't a jail
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00002.flac	in the uh casting process was amazing because to to make a character like daniel paletable you've gotta understand what others can see in him and and she's such an epithetic character and such a beautiful girl and that
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00003.flac	and she and i have just connected  and that can be that can be tough you don't connect with your with your leading lady with youre sofen grimes i think men long days but she's so great and then bringing scot wollfone to the show arja smith and lavarbriton is it's just a lovely lovely group of people there isn't a bad eg and uh i think that's
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00004.flac	have something that i realize i may never have and uh
id10296_Y-qKARMSO7k_00005.flac	in the last five episodes um a definite shift on danial's part to how he looks at her
id10296_ZEpT2orkZTc_00001.flac	peopthere is nothing to be afraid of it doesn't change your life doesn't affect you at all
id10296_ZEpT2orkZTc_00002.flac	feeling inside that you made a lot thousands and thousands of people and their familie's happy by simply checking a different box
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00001.flac	uh well i have to carry the wait of the gay community on a sitcom
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00002.flac	didn't think it would be hard it's like there's something there's a bigger subject matter that we can um
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00003.flac	for god's sake and and and stop drinking so much beer cause i honest where i i'
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00004.flac	pages i can't believe it because i'm i  as ai's like as a guy turning
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00005.flac	uh he was a guy watching me at that point do the thing that he was probably
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00006.flac	scrapbook dedicated to my father's days as an actor at wriers and alhe's pictures of
id10296__BVSKK5mGnY_00007.flac	and he said i um um i'm very proud of you and he gave me a hug and walked
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00001.flac	it was uh well i have to carry the way to the gay community on a sitcom
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00002.flac	i didn't think it would be hard it's like there's something there's a bigger subject matter that we can uh
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00003.flac	and he actually even went to wrierson and i found out in rierson i mean i said dad i'm going to
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00004.flac	this scraptbook dedicated to my father's days as an actor at riersand al hes pictures have bee
id10296_f_k09R8r_cA_00005.flac	and he said  um um i'm very proud of you and he gave me a hug and walked
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00001.flac	love playing somebody smarter than me i love i love throwing big words
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00002.flac	he and he loves it that's the thing you know he he's he's a teacher and he's a scientist and he loves kind of weilding um that that intelligence around and and of course the irony being that because he's skets afrenic his his brain can turn on him at any
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00003.flac	in me which is great i mean when we shot the pilot which was actualy acuplel yf years ago now it's going back to to thousand ten but i did a lot of research i wanted to make sure that i i got it right right out of the gate uh because it matters because i wanted the uh the meddal health community to to respect the show and
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00004.flac	trust my instincts and who this guy is and we can have just a lot of a lot of fun solving crimes coming up with really interesting twists and turns that only a nurro science bent and and his expertiees can uh can
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00005.flac	my favorit is the showuh begines and ends most most episodes with with lectures
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00006.flac	takes me all the way back to youmight remember this i the paper chase in the seventies which i just loved
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00007.flac	a lo school show um and and this the but the lectures are fun he's like the the the professor you wish you had he's like that guy
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00008.flac	what he does and funny and a little sexy i hope and uh so and these kind of book end the show and and and uh give it a a different feel and and that's um it's exausting but it's uh it's so
id10296_iLMjiAp4rTo_00009.flac	there's there's always tomorrow uh you can never take it for granted that this is gonna last forever as an actor even even inin in a successful show they can they come and go and um you've gotta keep inventing yourself uand and keep looking forward and remember that this could all disappear and first and foremost comes comes your family and uh
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00001.flac	he haddn't uh because he was a general practicianer he was a doctor
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00002.flac	good to be an actor it was looked down apon an i think he just kept it a secret he hid behind his doctorns but secreately h snupped down
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00003.flac	very wooden and shallow as an actor so i i found that it just lent
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00004.flac	that would be what we're hop what they should take away i think is ti sense that that u there was a time when when
id10296_mQ5JkSVET7c_00005.flac	feer mighthave been th motivation behind them ultimitely it was about entertainment and about
id10296_p1--IINtgGg_00002.flac	counter productive in that way we we we jumped ahead in the in the in the series finali to twenty years later so we've already seen rillan grau seporate and come back together as as uh older friends so i
id10296_p1--IINtgGg_00003.flac	you know i think if we have a reunion it will be as actors looking
id10296_p1--IINtgGg_00004.flac	on a tuesday night in front of an audience where the show lived and the audience was ad had waited six months for these tickets and and and the room was absolutely alive that's i think that's where the show
id10296_sr0JJ4UghCE_00001.flac	o uh of people living with parnt af kitsifrinia our our high functioning uh can can hold a job sometimes very responsible jobs um there's a woman who's been a real influenced to me named ellen sackxs who is a law professer at usc in in california and has beenliving with parn ods kitsifrienia for years she wrote a book called the center cannot hold
id10296_sr0JJ4UghCE_00002.flac	at at nobody may actually have held a a a a a job and may actually have had uh something else going on thut they're not we can't just dismiss them t the stigma of mental ilness is is the biggest thing
id10296_sr0JJ4UghCE_00003.flac	like danial with such influence and uh and and such ability uh reminds people
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00001.flac	well for me canada today is also my son's birthday he was born in the states he's american born but on canada day so uh weere usually up there my wife and son are up there right now in canada in in our house in vancouver uh with the fireworks and the barbacuwe you know very much the same as as here but i missed it because i'm in i'm still in new york uh finishing up aa show an
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00002.flac	we we were doing a very very funny bit written by will and greaces writers and will and grace essentially deb and i were doing our characters and we had a very funny bit about about how you know the trever project is it's t is about
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00003.flac	ticaly for youth um gay and straight aur equael that the they they hopefully we we're getting into a world where it's not an issue that kids won't be bullied and we we made a joke about not only are the equal how they're better wouldn't itwe wouldnt it be great if our kids and then we had a whole bunch of jokes ut the things that aure
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00004.flac	he completely shut down that his whatever comfort he has in the classroom he does not have on a crime cene he does not have in the fb offices with the clattering typewriters and the and the phone's ringing it's
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00005.flac	coster and in the midst of it he's a guy that is hense the title of the show he is perceving the world in such a way that it makes him an interesting um
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00006.flac	uh is is the guy that keeps umuh danial piearce
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00007.flac	centered because daniel is a guy that should be on his meds and he is not um and that is a a a kee element of the show without mack as his
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00008.flac	goes on he's ou peared to be his teacher's ad and his sort of um uh assistant buthe he's a lot more than that he's
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00009.flac	he keeps daniel grounded and uh does my wife do the same yes in fact i it's probably the opposit i probably drive my wife
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00010.flac	oh uh uh it's har it's it's it's almost sounds easy to to say from someone that has uh had a chance to to achieve these things but i i
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00011.flac	don't don't give up i mean i just i i can't imagine my life if i had questione there was a lot of
id10296_tlP585mCdl0_00012.flac	that was a nice sugestion but uh for me it was it was going full throttle and never dowuting
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00001.flac	so i would i'd go out of the stage door at at the end of the show every night and there was all these women withther with their program andther
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00002.flac	did you like the play she said it was oh i you were great i just i i think i liked you
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00003.flac	phones and and the the the uh food the the the worst for me was i i played another
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00004.flac	uh it's bout six years ago uh it's it's gotting to be type casting now and and uh
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00005.flac	bt play and it's me and four women and and ind the course of the play i i'm just awful to each of them at the end of the play uh mora terney walked off stage and i'm left there the guy in the front row and his
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00006.flac	she leaves the stage i sit down a'm devastated and before the lights even go down
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00007.flac	adso we all walked in and when james walked in it was it was like you know the the the pope had walked in and very very quicklly he wes
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00008.flac	he' okay with that i i asked him to put put himself on tape for a friend of mine uh who was turning fifty i i it was a
id10296_z2AISmwaXjo_00009.flac	it was a woman but i don't think he heard that part and i said just say whatever you want just say happy
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00001.flac	but uh bob foe put me in a movie back in nineteen eighty three called star eaighty where i murdered dorathy strattn
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00002.flac	probably one of the two most prepared directors i've ever worked with and that
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00003.flac	you could make up a question and he would give you real answer it was bisar and um and he's also an actor so he understands us heny he knows how to talk to us and knows how to
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00004.flac	everything across the boards everything above title is all slite alone you realize he might be a genius and it's an overuse an abused word but he might be a jenius the guy's
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00005.flac	i say to sly as i walk on the set every day okay
id10297_0mtJFC7OJv4_00006.flac	in the last bat man who had to had to go had to go ernist part had to go ot
id10297_23tlx1v1UCA_00001.flac	freak you out no i that's why i made it it when i when i read it it was freaky and i to the director he told me how he w's gonna
id10297_2eJ33J6xFVM_00001.flac	thator best the best or it's my party one of those three i hear about every eir pourt
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00001.flac	i just have a good time i i i like sit at home and my uh my wife is also my manager um puts pilf scripts on my desk
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00002.flac	and i go to work and uh she she runs the show basically and i'm the
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00003.flac	body always says to me it's a it's an od statement and i and it always it always throws me they always say you should be bigger
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00004.flac	yeh in fact i did my first play at four and a half and i played a
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00005.flac	stetter in gramer school you know how you how you go on the a run around the room wand evrybody reads a a
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00006.flac	is i could speak but if but if but if i didn't i gou u us uh
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00007.flac	i was under a lot of pressure and that's also that's also part of the
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00008.flac	lywell you know there's also when uh some parent sholl live
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00009.flac	like um you said you saw the uh the uh the ssi yeah i am  i des now i know that was a real wacko that was a crazy guy and he shop people up and he was strange and od and all the stuff and i was very good in that part i love those kind of characters but everybody thinks he must be
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00010.flac	he'd been around for forty five years fifty years and uh
id10297_31XtFWtF7Sc_00011.flac	e okay so it isn't about you know quality it's about how much how much how much you've done so i went after ything i went after everything and i've u since since then i've probably made a hundred
id10297_3vnz4Iy5fMg_00001.flac	e that if you never insulted a child or ever heart a child physically or ever ever humiliated a child that
id10297_3vnz4Iy5fMg_00002.flac	she's the nicest person i ever met and the best kisr i've
id10297_6-VE8e8RtZE_00001.flac	comman questions fans ask me are things like do are you and your sister get along and uh and we do and uh you know let me let me let mea clear something up right here right now all those rumors about us us not
id10297_6-VE8e8RtZE_00002.flac	along all happened because i got her started in show business right so then she gets pretty woman and becomes the uh the biggest star on ther
id10297_6-VE8e8RtZE_00003.flac	and the press is till you know talking to here like eric's little sister and one day she got sick of it and said i don't wanna hear his name anymore so i said o it must be a pobum there's no
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00001.flac	every day and i go to see him alive whenever i can because he makes my
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00002.flac	a wonderful series called bullet in the face asking what it's
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00003.flac	bullet in the face yeah it's cool anyway it's with eddye iszard and uh who's my favorite comic on the planete because uh so good because richard pryer died and uh and uh and uh i love the guy and uh he's a great guy too and we had a good time together and we made and we and we made a series and uh we made made
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00004.flac	the at the beginning of ta series and uh i think it's gonna be good it's a very black black black black black comedy and uh eddy isar is worth a price for
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00005.flac	ble he's so gifted he's so smart and he's so gentle it's a nice
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00006.flac	but uh yeah we're we're having a good time with sundancs also everybody's very sweet this year i and i i know it's i know it's the weather because it's always dumptd you and i've ben hin before the whole time and everybody's cranky cause ey have on all the bautiful clothes like i mentioned everybody's very sweet this year it's very nice everybody says excuse me and you
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00007.flac	did a very a very small what i considered to be
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00008.flac	lovelace i think it's called lovelace h about linda lovelace where
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00009.flac	she uh she grabed it and held hel holds on to it well she's uh she's really spectacular
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00010.flac	i think i think if this if this film gets uh the uh the distribution that it obviously will um
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00011.flac	here to promote is a love lace and uh and a bullit in the face and uh and say high to you and uh myh my family are big fans of yours by the way they uh they love watching you and uh just thought i'd pass it on i told
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00012.flac	for piy and is called p bake shop
id10297_6pjKcuVoHLM_00013.flac	bakshop dot com p not p but p is in pi and uh if you want the best pyon
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00001.flac	uh it is a major problem and it's dealt with in a way that that that we'd have to deal with
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00002.flac	i were i would ly about it but uh i think i think this state oddly enough has a very good
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00003.flac	very far away and i was tired and i get home and i'm told by my wife hifhon manager that uh i i have an audition for a show called heroes and i went i'm twoo tired canat
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00004.flac	after star aigty i can not get a date for three years with a nice girl and that's not
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00005.flac	as i as its supposed to be ind that you don't know where he's gonna take our people since i recrut the heros is he looking for
id10297_FvbLoirHpx0_00006.flac	or the week after in my brain that actually changes the whole course of my
id10297_HAinRPec5xI_00001.flac	anybody inthis industryn no matter what the fao of the industry you're in a be it be at a camera bi acting riding producing directing whatever it is treat everybody you met like you're gonna be your bas tomorrow i
id10297_HXlH44r0jYc_00001.flac	the butcher was the originality and the cleverness of the script i mean it it was something i hadn't read before or seen before even though it is it is a shooting up bangim not come down movie
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00001.flac	like anything else in the whole world it's what you make of it and i know that sounds
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00002.flac	uhi i don't think i do either but uh but i understand them yu now being in my forties i understand their mistakes i don't condone them but i understand them and uh and i'm not angry with either of them anymore i think i think i
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00003.flac	emotionlly unstable but and they are both uh
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00004.flac	which is a big problem but uh but but uut uh but besides that they're
id10297_kWOMY99knWI_00005.flac	how to get out of it i basically i basically ruined every relationship i ever had ruined my career ruined everything so i had no where to go but u

id10298_VHtcwtdPjpE_00001.flac	atand i look for it because you look for the uh distinct sounds and and then expression of how they express their words so this one is very distinctive
id10298_VHtcwtdPjpE_00002.flac	of what blew my mind chopps they call it the throwing in of thati saw it and i just just blew my mind and i said wo
id10298_VHtcwtdPjpE_00003.flac	the they call him nick luopin uh loopin lopes because he he does the areo tricks with a heloc
id10298_a0S-epXYJME_00001.flac	well smaletran um is an organization which is the lodges uh lodges clef palet charity they were established in nineteen ninety
id10298_a0S-epXYJME_00002.flac	different different countries in which they help children with their cleft palets they
id10298_a0S-epXYJME_00003.flac	y you see the burning a building shooting a priest and her wyf iveoh or shooting heroin how's he gonna be a good guy so the produce the producer came up with a great idea he says you know what i want na do
id10298_a0S-epXYJME_00004.flac	and once he put me in that uniform and screen tested me it made me visually nutral and you know
id10298_aEuSKFj0xo8_00001.flac	no i wanted to be a cop first on newoar cop at seventeen i changed my mind and then i got cause i got bit by the acting bug in tha drama and
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00001.flac	eahi was uh son as you put something about a uniform  son as you put it on you geta
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00002.flac	but i was it was all right because i knew it was wrong so when the  by the time he got to my window i already had the licene sticking out
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00003.flac	se when we film our location said uh we herd you got a ticket this morning i said i said id just happened two minutes
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00004.flac	it' uh we well we i finished about two and a half years ago we finished it originally i was every time i worked in lattin america i they would always dub my voice cause i was born to rase ta new
id10298_f5eaTNf7-io_00005.flac	and because this show was so big it was the highest rata his spanich show ind the history of lattin television and still is i wone the spanish equivelant to the mmy uh for
id10298_gNR5NHzd3o0_00001.flac	and that's what it did for me and he was such a great guy for about four years and i
id10298_hSC1Yb953Sg_00001.flac	show it's indicated around the country it's on mbc in los angeles i'm not sure what the cindicated station is for
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00005.flac	e you could take advantage of a second chance and if not you can create a second chance by reinventing yourself which i've had to do in this business in show business mean i
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00006.flac	up as a cop on tv because i want to be an actor and thenu as an actor on tv and now in real life i'm a real cop who acts once in a while so i wen in complete circle i took advantage of the opportunities that presented themselves
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00007.flac	uh that's why i can personally identify with the message of second chances
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00008.flac	i brought that that it's there it's always in there somewhere o kno so i brought that
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00009.flac	the joy of being involved in a disny project one of the really great things about the movie is that you can bring your child you can park him in front of the screen and you can let him watch this and that child will walk away wit
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00010.flac	the with the nohow and the ability to understand that there are second chances in life that  once presented
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00017.flac	but he races and uh he's quite good at it he's champion admired and
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00018.flac	but he has ah a misfortune of his engin
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00019.flac	and what happens is that they can't produce that part they don't make it anymore it's discontinued it comes that time in the movie where he has to  he has to go under this brige and then he's gotta power up to go straight up
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00020.flac	and he meets those challengers but at the same time puts himself in jepordy like firefihters do every day frontline because if he goes to a certain level of speed he could blow up he could burst
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00021.flac	he's atchieved hi second chance and and and he also shows great
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00022.flac	people that become cops people that get involved in public service where they're
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00023.flac	because they step to the left or they step to the right or they walk in on a situation like police officers one of the most dangerous things is a
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00024.flac	officer and it's they all dol tell you the most dangerous call is a domestic
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00025.flac	these people this is their job they become this because they're compassionate
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00026.flac	the job does changein cause after the third day on the beat for me and i worked gravyard because i couldn't work during the day i rol up on a house or on a call
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00027.flac	and for firefiters who are the first to arive at a situation at an
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00028.flac	they're the first to show up they're they're considered we call them as officers we call them the frontline but we're right there with them but they're the front
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00029.flac	tank you is important this movie says thank you fire fiters thank you for risky
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00030.flac	they don't really care about getting ta metele they don't really you don't really care about being
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00033.flac	they  i the audience as o like it for the same reason i liked it i was well personally i'm glad to to have been involved but the movie itself is exciting it's funny it's really funny  and the music is
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00034.flac	a simple thing that you get a child at five years old you could teach a child five years old
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00035.flac	because i's it's proven they're more retainive at a young age so that's why you you gotto get a child young give him the necessary tools to go on in life like
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00036.flac	being open to second chances you fall downa you get up
id10298_hjvQiiG71rM_00037.flac	you get up dust yourself off and move forward go and do your dream get it done you can do it you can do it thir's always the opportunity for a second chance if i doesn't present itself you make the opportunity of a second chance for yourself that's what the movie teaches
id10298_qrJ0fQJP5gs_00001.flac	s he a pilote uh to uh patric wane john waine's son that i i went upfor i didn't get and then i lost the next one to uh desiones junr and then the third one that i was lucky to go ofp for was

id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00003.flac	can place himself in he position of saying that's me i cauld do that i know how to do it because your imagination
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00004.flac	and rememborance rememborance is an awful big
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00005.flac	can place himself in the position of saying that's me i cauld do that i know how to do it because your imagination
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00006.flac	and rememborance rememborance is an awful big
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00008.flac	and nothing else you take the printed word and you make it come from your heart and your head period i i said that one time to these youngxsters that were in yeal university going to the yeail school a drama i was invited to lecture the pepl yal school a
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00009.flac	uh uh well uh are you one of those uh uh wher wher where they used to call malan brando uh w that school of acting
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00010.flac	i said what we're doing right now just talking between each other we're acting this is what actingis all about we are acting towite you're listening to me and i'm listening to you and i answer you in kind so i back and forth that's
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00011.flac	no no no no no they couldn't believe it i said well what else would you
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00012.flac	a shook their heads sad by goly you're right you're right that's what acting is all about cause it comes from here
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00013.flac	over these things you know and i i love i loved reading between the lines you know to me
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00014.flac	my personage but i u the personage of this character that the theuh writer wrote about
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00015.flac	and so i i go over each and every line do i
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00016.flac	does that line make sense to me oh why would i say that line if i you know if i wanted to say something else what would i say in it
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00017.flac	and and all these things i take inde consideration as we're going along reading and studying because i always feel that somewhere out there are's a
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00018.flac	and you say what do you say what do you say you've lost them you've lost them
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00019.flac	sense to you yet you had to say it because it and i say
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00020.flac	that's no good so you break down the word you look up something that pertains to that word and you aske the writer about it naturally he sayd oh yes yes i should have thought of that myself but you know you work it out and then the first thing you know those thump succkers are satisfied and i said guy gohly that was a a was a good play that was a good show why because he believed it he believed
id10300_7byARrJfhlI_00021.flac	not the words of thea of this of the of the f the play but he believed what youre

id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00002.flac	and people would look at it and the kids would look at it and be all loded down with guns and everything else you know and there was there was ha you know

id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00006.flac	a script like this and say okay let's shoot it me i've gota
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00007.flac	script and thenh take every word for what i can you know and make something out of it he could just dam that's it he had a photographic mind just like brod crowford had at one time it just
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00008.flac	i i often how can the people do it this is amazing to have a photographic memory and shoot
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00009.flac	derful a wonderful pilot and he took us up for orientation to see how we

id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00013.flac	listening to what the radio and everything else you got to be on the ball and be a helecopter pilot and this well at one time jones was out there doing
id10300_xiFC4HwUcww_00014.flac	looped a loop you know tes crazy things over the pacific otion while we were shooting down by the water and i said are you doing what i think you're doing
id10301_6uqGkiR2oTI_00001.flac	from china uh after working on a film and was kindof frustrated with his career
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00001.flac	well you know when i first um got the audition for congo or the meeting for congo i
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00002.flac	cast i think we really really some really creative work and and very some corrageous
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00003.flac	have a hard time doing but it was great to be a part of it and uh but i think when your we were first and we didn't get the actelaes we didn't get the imma nominations andh the recognition from the the industry but i think by the time we finished and sopranos came along
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00004.flac	yeah you know i i just because i i was a warden of the prison so i always felt that i had to
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00005.flac	about them and so it became very important for me to whold my own in the mids of all that you know sometimesi
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00006.flac	and then putting my soot on and shin my shoes which is kinda my
id10301_AeRSD9jIdSg_00007.flac	the character and when id stepd out on the set the the friendship so i was like i was wardin

id10301_Eu8Bj1gx5_4_00001.flac	uh before he became a movie you know t's sometimes it's better o have the
id10301_Eu8Bj1gx5_4_00002.flac	um and um you know the black panther is probably um
id10301_UkrkPwZd77Y_00001.flac	lik o say i is what it is uh i' v i'm very happy to be a part of it uh i don't understand
id10301_UkrkPwZd77Y_00002.flac	i don't always understand so you know just wanting ye fans know that if i'm not it's not
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00001.flac	uh you know t over the years it's ben over thirty years and all these little girls and they gostbust outfits they come up and uh i'm
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00002.flac	representing you know and um you know the script is amazingly funny the
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00003.flac	ck you know so i'm back and bill murry and dan ackroy sgurnan wever and we all coming but the girls
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00004.flac	who you believe is the best performance the worst thing to happen would be for someone to vote based on
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00005.flac	or the performance um so it's not really i think the responsibility of the academy as much as the industry to be more inclusive to allow people of
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00006.flac	nonsense excuse um we need to be more inclusive
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00007.flac	and as o directors and and as all of us excepting the
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00008.flac	lok at the world the way the world is i can't tell you how many things i've seen and it's like no
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00009.flac	so we just have to be and i don't think it's an atempt i think it's just a lack of awareness people go i didn't think about that well it's time to
id10301_VIAnMw7J5tI_00010.flac	tion then really focused on what the problum is because i don't think it's a i don't think it's a a major problem we just have to be
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00001.flac	first movie they ever saw whatever so they tied the movie into their lives in a very strange
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00002.flac	pete never saw orn everyone talked about so is thins to have a few that people
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00003.flac	yeah yeah i've been very blessed i think it's uh you know i'm an actor and so my job is o
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00004.flac	well i mean i really love him and i appreciate bill and he's always been uh there
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00005.flac	the stronger movie the second one was more family friendly yeah and i think if you're a little kid and four parents who wanta be kids
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00006.flac	have a lot of lines that at the time i was saying them i didn't realize people would be wolding you know thirty
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00007.flac	you know like you work and so i i come out here i meet these
id10301_eVfmXU0RtRo_00008.flac	for people who actually see the movie and and and it registers you know so i mean it
id10301_hX6LjjVtnGs_00001.flac	seen the movie about a hundred and fifty times and he knows every line and the
id10301_hX6LjjVtnGs_00002.flac	decided named  gost bustis three because we never thought we'd come over with another movie and then um bill murry decided to do the video game and uh and then said
id10301_rXRbmL7nzIo_00001.flac	that point wherne she realizes that the past his gone and she has to move on and i'm part of that
id10301_rXRbmL7nzIo_00002.flac	for thirty years uh people are putting on the jumpsuits and making the back packs and turning the cars an
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00001.flac	you know the world can be difficult but i i just had very amazingly blessed
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00002.flac	so i i i don't know what that has to do you know the hardest thing i think it's trying to
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00003.flac	hive to do something and you really and i'm very good i can really dissipline myself and i and i'll trym down and i'll drop
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00004.flac	wo three or four nights in a role you know what's gonna you know also i didn't really um because i had responsibilities in
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00005.flac	you know association franchised b just kindaf like ther now we have
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00006.flac	uh i don' thishe's not that importanti mean i'd love to be a part of but you know because a studio has made choices that somehow left winson out of it
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00007.flac	eah i don't just a sitting  soome saye oh yeah when we make the o the gost busses i know they're gonna call me i don't know it
id10301_vhzF7dhGJzI_00008.flac	but uh the movie was never really meant to be monro kellie's movie i think the movie was meant to behe
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00001.flac	is uh we follow the lives of four basic characters jack black tim robins asof mabe and pablo shryiver as theyre stories intertwined during the geopolitical caos trying to avert world war three i play the president julian the
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00002.flac	uh uh the first and the next first latino president on tv but it's a comedy it's kind of a black comedy
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00003.flac	i i think my whole life i've been thinking about what it would be like to be a president i mean i i grew up
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00004.flac	and uh who i believe was the last truly kind of independant president that we've had everybody else seems
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00005.flac	other interests beholding that they're beholdeng to so i look at him as a le you know
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00006.flac	the movie's more than the average american we consume their product beyond our numbers yet we're represented way and far below our numbers and when we are represented we're not always represented well so we thought well how do you change that and you change that in my
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00007.flac	r in their fields of expertis and we wanna help them by not only raising mones to help them finish their theces but uh also
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00008.flac	to help connect them to the industry the industry's always looking for the right people to connect to their projects and people of this background are kind of under represented in in the producorial staff so we want to help
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00009.flac	connect people to the marcket place that will use him ind hopefully that will change the the landscape because if the folks behind the scenes understand who we are and are made up of us i think they'll be less likely to stereotype us
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00010.flac	because you know we can all just work for ourselves and our individual success but i think if we all succeed it it's a sweeter success
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00011.flac	what good is having freedom if someone else doesn't what good is having wealth next to someone who's starving
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00012.flac	dictator that you can not only take care of yourself and be self reliant but if you're really
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00013.flac	you can make sure that people around you are not in unnecessary need i don't believe in giving people everything they want for free and for no effort i believe in helping people
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00014.flac	you're a stard to your family and your friends whol always believe in you say hey you
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00015.flac	do this you can do this but when you get to holy everybody wants to be a star everybody wants to be successful and all of a sudden you feel like just a tiny peble on a very big beach so you have to figure out a way to stand out you have to figure out a way to do
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00016.flac	without kind of overstepping your bounds you kind of really pay attention and see what others do that work and that doesn't work we have to learn from our mistakes
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00017.flac	keep at it if you keep at anything you will eventually become better if it's what's you're meant to do
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00018.flac	now if it's not working and you don't have passion for it it's okay find another job but if you have a a zen for this
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00019.flac	egoso they say in spanish thir's joy while you're doing your craft it's not about the money it's not about the fame it's about knowing you were doing what you were born to
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00020.flac	once in a while i wonder is it all worth it because you know we get high and we get low what you foks out there think is a very successful person sometimes as a person who's insecure about their next move sometimes you work and wrk and work and all of a sudden for months the phone doesn't ring and you're like waite a minute but i've done all this stuff so there's no garantee you know
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00021.flac	i so think okay once i make my first big movie they'll discover me and they'll see that i was you know it'll be easier yes it's
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00022.flac	it's not that and it shouldn't be that what happens is you figure out that the
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00023.flac	the destination learning how to love what you do whether or not it pays off right away will keep you able to do it a lot longer and chances are the longer you do it the better your onsere
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00024.flac	just nothing like it because it it really combined it was a syinthasis of americana rock and role latinos and
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00025.flac	took itself to another level because of all the talent that came together to make it shine and it wasn't just a success in latino audience ses ant homes it was a success that reached a universal
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00026.flac	appeal to audiences outside of the traditional catagory so i was very happy to be a part of a a film that let me shine that let me play a real human being not just a a bad guy but a full
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00027.flac	and i i was a young man i was twenty three at the time playing somebody older playing richi's older brother and uh
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00028.flac	it's um it's pretty epic i gotto say i remember now the things we did the rehearsals meeting the real valenwenla family meeting the real bob motalice was a blessing
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00030.flac	when i tell people you are unique whoever you are find out what's so unique about you
id10302_2Er-cV85fc4_00031.flac	and that which makes you care about another person makes you care about your character you have to stay in
id10302_33L7c-DPCJQ_00001.flac	ye you work things out and you bring it to the set but uhe we we go there is a process
id10302_33L7c-DPCJQ_00002.flac	okay we got away with that because it's true it's

id10302_K2IuvkS1s38_00002.flac	uh i sometimes will tell you too much so that you don't understand what isn what's not real
id10302_K2IuvkS1s38_00003.flac	there's te there's h there's something to mis in dis information francisco does the opposite
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00001.flac	hih i men symoralis and you're watching muse actually you are a muse
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00002.flac	pointing out that i'm still rather young in my career relatively uh it feels like i'm about to diy uh no no the first life time achevement award i got was
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00003.flac	but uh i got over that real quick and um i'm just looking forward to looking back because i don't do that a lot i i when people aske me what's your favorite job you've ever done i go the one i'm about to do next
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00004.flac	the one that's gonna put my kid through school another year the oneth's gonna make sure you know we're okay and we can save up some money uh
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00005.flac	and a career and i'm blessed to be able to do something that i love doing that can also feed my family you know that that to me is the ultimate blessing i i have passion
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00006.flac	the one i'm about to do next the one that's gonna put my kid through school another year the onets gonna make sure you know we're okay and we can save up some money
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00007.flac	around eighteen years giving out awards uh is acnowleging me is  i's a major honor because they're an international organization they're about diversity they're about the human condition human rights and
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00008.flac	unity one of the films uhh the film that they're opening the festival with is called lost bird is a collaboration between an armenian and turkish filmmakers so that's a huge step that's like an israly palistinian collaboration that's like you know u collaboration between north and south carea
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00009.flac	communities that have been traditionally opposed to each other coming together to to create beauty and art that makes us feel better about you know being alive that is what i'm about so that this organization is honering me and they have those goalds and values
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00010.flac	saw us on film when we were you know the bad guys we were the guys to kill we were the guys the good guys to you know do away with and uh
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00011.flac	and it's sad i i felt it then the film i did before that that put me on the map was bad boys with shon pen and i played the main bad guy there and even though i played the main bad guy in labumba there was a difference with labamba because we were all shown as three dimentional we were human beings not just heaite fotter not just people to to you know want you're hero to vanquish
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00012.flac	and the character that i played had so many dimentions and facets that
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00013.flac	e felt for him he wasn't just a bad guy you felt his pain you wanned to you know nock him upside the head a few times but you also wanna take him and hug him and say hey you mean something too and i think that's what a lot of people need a lot of people in this world you know fallthrough the crack
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00014.flac	and they just don't get appreciated they don't get the love that you know they felt they deserved whether it's from their parents or from their
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00015.flac	or coworkers you know that's whor you get people going postal quoteim quote because they don't feel loved they don't feel appreciate the don't feel like they're connected to the human race and if that's the case then there's no love lost and they act out you know so
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00016.flac	i'm grateful i'm excited and and i'm looking forward to reminding people that you know
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00017.flac	i see more which is good but you know you gotto remember even from the eighties when labamba came out they said oh yeah it was gonna be a a wave they call the latino wave but wht do we know about waves they come and they go and we just nee need to make sure we're more than just a
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00018.flac	you know we're not a temporal presence in this country we buy we over index in consumption of entertainment prodects whether it's television whether it's internete we out spend
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00019.flac	um our own percentages yet we are very very marginally
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00020.flac	to this day so that says to me that while we've come a long way we still have a long way to go so that we reach something near paredy
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00021.flac	well especially since the election of the first african american president you see how corparate comercials have changed now they have black you know african american
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00022.flac	now you have mixed families being not such a big deal i mean i've watched commercials and i'm realizing whow we've evolved so i hope the same goes for us i hope it
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00023.flac	we get a president for people to actually put us int leads an movies and and storylines or comercial anymore
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00024.flac	but that they realize that we are part of their family that we are as american as anyone else matter of fact maybe even more american because
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00025.flac	our ansesters come from the americas as well as from europ so we have this continent within us so when people talk about
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00026.flac	you know what those are americans too they're central americans they're south americans and they're north americans mexico is in north america so let's watch how we treat people that aren't quotinqote
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00027.flac	because they are american and they're human beings and they just want to live and feed they're
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00028.flac	like everybody else so i don't wanna mention any candadate's name
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00029.flac	poking at us predictively getting a lot of attention in return for it but not getting enough pushback and that's why i was at a raly a few weeks ago with uh fetheico pana and dolotas wetta at the gopas uh
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00030.flac	we do not accept this we're gonna take your slings and arros and instead of get angry and fight back and go
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00031.flac	other roud things we can say we're gonna take those arroes and create bridges and ladders and rise above the ocasion and we're gonna kill our enimies with kindness and show them that you know what you do not define
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00032.flac	surewell i just did something that aired on blue blods a little a little something just to test the waters there and i just finished taping something for motcart in the jungle which is a wonderful show very much like the kinds that we need to see where guy goto seea bennal who's a brilliant mexican actor is the lead he plays a conductor very much like dodamele who uh in this episodes goes back to mexico his you know our
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00034.flac	political leaders and things that are to me a warm welcom away from the rapist
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00035.flac	gangbangers stabvers you know people that scare the public i'm here to let you know that
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00036.flac	we come in all kinds sises shapes collaors and attitudes
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00037.flac	it's hard you know after doing this for thirty five years to find a new angle on some of these arcatypes but then that's good that's a challenge you know i'm the kinda person that uh you know after bristling at at at an unexpected barior then i'm like waite a minit hang on that canhl
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00038.flac	because that which does not kill you makes you stronger and we have to teach our young people that the barriors that they face as daunting as they are are blessings in disgus cause once you
id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00039.flac	i was it  it t i kno i virall i um i was there shooting a a a short a little a lttle piece for someone else a young filmmaker and um as i was

id10302_K2_D_tFdAgY_00041.flac	even after we we we exposed that it was just a uh self made hoks and you know  part of me thinks i might i o maybe i shoulda
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00001.flac	center or rarely the center of the story we were rarely pivital and i always felt like we were flavoring
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00002.flac	made it latino cause we wanted to ae flavor flavor a lattin just a touch se never enough more like  set dressing the danger it's called  albario
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00003.flac	saying if you wanna send a message go to western union well i got a message for that mentality every
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00004.flac	let's find them let's look for them and disect them is it good for us or is it bad for us and if it's bad for us then just
id10302_KaZPZcTPQ-c_00005.flac	so you know we gotta be really concious about what is out there and support
id10302_Ls9NUpj2les_00001.flac	to so much catastraphy  gonna put people who've lived there for thousands and
id10302_OMw6_X2IDvE_00001.flac	beings and especially people with culture class and heart like the persian community
id10302_OMw6_X2IDvE_00002.flac	much more than is always you know than is appreciated in the media
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00001.flac	uh as a result of my relationship with rashoter nestor green who is a three time recsipient of ur scholarship from the national and spanic foundation for the arts it's a foundation that we do in dc we have a yearly uh fund raiser to raise money to help kids who are
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00002.flac	selling in their schools uh ivleaus certain ivleaue schools if you have a hiden high enough grad point average and if you write to us and tell us why you want our help we we hand out scolarships nd they they're not change your live scholarships

id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00008.flac	you know the inner workings of a family with an issue you know with seuali
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00009.flac	and you know what the funny thing is that that you can make so many u analogies he went into one prison but he was still imprisoned by his beliefs tat
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00010.flac	still imprisoned by his attitudes his unevolved attitudes towards his child's
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00011.flac	uh you know he's he's put everything he has into it and uand it shows it's a
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00012.flac	uh he went to enwyu film school with uh spike lee as a as a mentor
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00013.flac	and you know go crazy and like you know be the biggest cheer leader but they will give themselves
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00014.flac	it's u and that's what i love about the script nobody's a real bad guy in this movie you don't need a
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00015.flac	cause everybody's trying to help each other to no end and hu wrote to hellis
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00016.flac	from being laughed at and and spit appon because when you're a lattin kid that's whats your parents tell you you don't wanna be like

id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00019.flac	be a certain way and their sexuality  is like an
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00020.flac	you know it shouldn't defin their politics so what i loved is being all
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00021.flac	but people have a certain desire to be a certain way
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00022.flac	and their sexuality is like an adendum you know it shouldn't defin their politics so what i loved is being all progressive and understanding
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00023.flac	and i love quotonquote drag queens cause my
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00024.flac	you said always have great banter tey always have the best returns theyare the ean the will set you stragt quick so i have  a a a an affinity i loved the movie precilla queen of the desart i thought it was brilliant those actors most of them ware straight i believe did a great job but that wouldn't have worked in this
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00025.flac	by this movie and i thought oa i was already there i thought o you know
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00026.flac	it's like i tell people no one scein does this movie no one ceen described it completely
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00027.flac	y guts are ripped out because you know these people love each

id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00030.flac	if you also go the other way with that it could be unintentionally dreary and depressing we didn't want that so this is a real tyght rope walk and i was surprised pleasantly surprised by just how
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00031.flac	uh harmoni's performance was uh you know cause we cut around certain things and we use the best and man you would think she's been acting for a while ando it doesn't matter you just fall in love with that beautiful face incredibl
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00032.flac	has been like oh my god i had no idea i thought i was walking into another kind

id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00035.flac	that after all this technology all this time of supposedly evolving into an incredible you know human race that can do
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00036.flac	one of or first reviews at a sundance which was incredible the standing levation sould out every time
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00037.flac	thend they had large gakentage but when they were chearing and screaming and then a reviewer gave us a snarky revt said it we were swimming in a see of colichas well obviously they
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00038.flac	we're no cleeshos at all clesays are based on reality yeah we have a lot of people in jail yeah we have a lot of
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00039.flac	yeah we have a lot of machesmok but you know it doesn't know how to
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00040.flac	int that's a cleche but it's like saying you know a love story is a clice cause a man's in love with a woman ok how many times have we seen that before
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00041.flac	really watch the film maybe they resented the audiencee's reaction and they had to give it a
id10302_VRCidrXwd1s_00042.flac	they must have gone to the bathroom for three quarters of it based on what was written
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00001.flac	first of all when i read the script i knew i had to be in the movie this was good
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00002.flac	another big star will take it and make it about his background
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00003.flac	i was just flabergasted i was flored because i saw a chance to show our family a lattin family in a
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00004.flac	way so the chucho character was not my first choice i was more interested in jimmy
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00005.flac	within a short amount of time in the center of the piece bhut i felt it was a wonderful way for me
id10302_WAbHmvQ9zME_00006.flac	my talent or energies to this movie and i i i'm not i don't
id10302_YQCymlcowOg_00001.flac	no seriously i i i would love to tell you but he's gonna go through what i would
id10302_YQCymlcowOg_00002.flac	uh t like so many tribes and they all have their own diolects and
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00001.flac	and it's time that good hearted people everywhere you know gave credit to those networks and programs
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00002.flac	is it's like you know it really the they're like your children especially when you don't have other children and you learn a lot about yourself and your temper and your ability to be patient
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00003.flac	oa degree dog's really try your patience but you know what it's a good thing cause after a while you learn  maybe i shouldn't yell at my dog all the time you know maybe i should be nicer to him cause sometimes you'  busy and you get all caught up
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00004.flac	you know my dog will run up on people and like put his nose where it doesn't belong um put paus on like nice
id10302_ZAMRSlopMWA_00005.flac	o but i realize that they're very sensitive and suttle creatures ut they could hear the difference in a change of tone so i don't have to
id10302__wzYMUt91gc_00001.flac	pledon't wanna hear where their food comes from what a great thing that a movie actually deals with us head on not only what we do to the animals but
id10302__wzYMUt91gc_00002.flac	clever not beat you over the head too much way how we are not very different or at least the people in that industry are not very
id10302__zm31vf2P7U_00001.flac	yeah well the thing is my guy is a is a good bad guy a bad good guy he's the kinda person that uh means well but unfortunately uh didn't make the right
id10302__zm31vf2P7U_00002.flac	too late for certen of the things in his life and his wife may be having an affair and his son may
id10302__zm31vf2P7U_00003.flac	it's uh i  i don't wanna giv it away too much but it is very harrowing to figure out
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00001.flac	you know uh dvarit if possible because you're gonna wanna go
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00002.flac	it's just wonderful to have entertainment that doesn't talk down to it's
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00003.flac	and it's just so kindaf like the lowast comman denominator entertainment it's so refreshing to be on a
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00004.flac	a storyline and and the implications of of what what it is
id10302_dtYK1cUF7mo_00005.flac	so fifty eight or so i know some people are ae saying wait a minut about the age but there's an answer for
id10302_ekqJava7sdE_00001.flac	he's u he he's the representative of not only how much we love our artist but as lettin men how strong

id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00004.flac	in a studio and i did get a chance to work with dian although it was really od i was in toronto she was in los angeles so she was on a moneter inhr in my studio i could see her on a tv
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00005.flac	and she could see me in a tv moneter in her studio and it was the one session when we got a chance to do scenes together and it was really quite amazing for a number of reasons one is just watching her work and you're seeing the
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00006.flac	the greatest time watching finding dory i think a lot well first
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00007.flac	it's dorie and it's marlen and they're they're back you know in a big way and
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00008.flac	e you know the same i i think you know the same sense of adventure that uh that the  story kind of uh told in finding uh nemo
id10304_0TJ9sdJiDvA_00009.flac	is pretty much there in spades in finding doriy you know uh ther there are some amazing adventures funny and terrifying
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00001.flac	doesn't get along with my my daughter from my first marriage but  the daughter from my first marriage
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00002.flac	yeah my my second wife and the same with my mother who played
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00003.flac	cought up in this uh ponziy situation that leads to the whole witness protection
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00004.flac	uh thing buth you know as a as a uh as a dad i don't think i'm a diciplinarian
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00005.flac	that's one of the problems with this family that stems for me i'm just not strong enough re i should be and i'm not
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00006.flac	lik madea in that in that sense of you know dicipline and and dues and donts you know i had some excentric
id10304_7geDDtDmWQU_00007.flac	you know it was fun hanging around them much the way it's fun hanging around madea but we didn't get the same sense of
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00001.flac	i definitely was a a fan offinding nemo i thought it was one of the great animated features
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00002.flac	was just uh it was funny it was hard warming i thought the voice that elen brought to the character was quite amazing and
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00003.flac	uh what brought me to doriy uh they asked me to do it and i said yes before i could even hear the rest of the
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00004.flac	to boot it was the finding nemo
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00005.flac	in serious you know sycheatric sessions to to kind of
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00006.flac	i was fascinated by what they did with the face
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00007.flac	because the the character the animated character doesn't look any fortunat
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00008.flac	um it's own distinctive kind of character i didn't recognize
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00009.flac	n kind of in my career and that that i thought was really quite amazing
id10304_CN6JpPYbHCQ_00010.flac	uh and it was i i i just think that animation is so brilliant what those
id10304_CaR6c7RO7Dc_00001.flac	a sex advice you know avoid it but um you know that ain't gonna happen
id10304_CaR6c7RO7Dc_00002.flac	on uh your own experience but i can't say that's uh true because i you know i never really quite got to that fase
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00001.flac	spelled chdvot is a legitimate cirname
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00002.flac	we looked up in several phonebooks and found
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00003.flac	in different cities and en in several countries so you know our argument was if you're interviewing somebody lets say on your news broadcast and you're supering people that you are interviewing on the air and their name happen to be
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00004.flac	one the you know cbc over which is they couldn't argue against the fact that this is a person's name we have a right to you know to use that as the titl it's the name of the family that founded the
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00005.flac	first successful comedy show sitcom not comedy show sitcom that this country
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00006.flac	to the audience without it being the real name certainly not an impression jo was not doing an impression of loiyd uh
id10304_FJOvOooCIvs_00007.flac	because there are no bounderies you can you can kind of go where you wanta go creatively and if the audience wants to go with you
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00001.flac	the most appropriate name for our show our show is about a wealthy wealthy family who lose
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00002.flac	uh so they loose and they they they bought a town when they had
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00003.flac	xteen year old son as a birthday present and and uh the reason we bought it as a joke was because the town was called shits creek and now that they've lost everything the only the only place that can actually afford to
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00004.flac	nthe show and my daughter sara is also on the show playing wi te the waitress and dan my son
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00005.flac	well it's a different way to go i mean an improvised movie like these movies where we kind of have a written at line and uh but we don't write the dialog uh is a is a very very fun way to shoot a movie because you just don't know what's going to happen in front of the camera we don't have any rehearsals um so it's always fun
id10304_GRv7pEnTwUc_00006.flac	to to improvise and you always use kind of mimprovisation in
id10304_GbpCKIcUyGA_00001.flac	second city show hi weit was like mid seventies when we saw our first shicago show and there was there was we noticed a big
id10304_GbpCKIcUyGA_00002.flac	scenes um i i wasn't i i i i i i and i thought well how can they do a sene this long kind of with very few laughs and yet the
id10304_GbpCKIcUyGA_00003.flac	uh the late the late gread gillde radner and and uh so we did
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00001.flac	well it was i i was excited about the prospect of doing scenes with stiffler's mom and of course it turned out to
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00002.flac	you know as much fun as i uh as i knew what would be yeah for me it was
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00003.flac	you know the the the uh when when i kind of realized where the where the story was going once i found out i just i i mean to me that was like you know finally i got to
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00004.flac	itt and it worked so well between you the chemistry was brilliant and i noll you guys were in ninete hata fam a little earlier on and it was very very funny because there was a group of guys down stairs in

id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00007.flac	f if this works uh for the studio and they're quite happy with it i mean i wouldn't be shocked if they decided to go for another one but its you know something tells me
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00008.flac	you know i mean if i was a betting man i guess i i i might say this could be h
id10304_HTL8iLI75TY_00009.flac	well i it's not it's not that it's not really that difficult but i understand why why it's still shocking to people because that's the uh the personality of the movie i think you know the if you can't be shocked by an american py

id10304_JQtDfEz08aU_00039.flac	and that's how it first kind of came upand when john and i actually sat in his hotel room one day in edmanton watching a u

id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00002.flac	sensability and and we we kinda did that and our sensibility really is
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00003.flac	ouethere's a fly in the wall and all of a sudden the money is gone yes so that was
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00004.flac	ind the you know ar weu great writers and dan's doing a great job we're ning a room now
id10304_dz2ohrKoOBA_00005.flac	on in this town now which means more interaction with the towns people and i think that's wher all the characters in their own
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00001.flac	well it was uh it was a pretty exciting thing when we
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00002.flac	and uh and it was uh you know when when when it when i finally got to hear what the story was how the characters were kinda moving along and uh what what uh john and headon the writer directors had in
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00003.flac	for this uh i got very excited you know when i cause i thought their their their story the way they were laying it out was was very
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00004.flac	and kindo fresh so it was uh it was a lot of fun
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00005.flac	for this uh i got very excited you know when i cause i thought there the're
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00006.flac	well it was it was fantastic i mean one of one of the great things was knowing i was gonna be doing scenes with with jenifer with stiffler's mom and getting jim's dad and stiffler's mom together was just i thought of just a an amazingly
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00007.flac	and and and you know we we had a uh and and our
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00008.flac	and um and it was just kindof fun on the set and it was uh for the
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00009.flac	i thought it was just a really interesting way to go and stepping outside of what we
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00010.flac	brilliant aspects of the script was was making jim's dad a widower because it did open up a lot of different you know avenues here and one was that it it
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00011.flac	enabled jim and his dad to kind of you know have
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00012.flac	so that was you know i thought that was um that was pretty amazing and you know quite
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00013.flac	the scene i shot n in this movie was in the back in the bedroom with jem
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00014.flac	like i was doing the original american piy everything was the same the wallpaper the the
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00015.flac	you know the everything in that room was i was identical to the way it was back then so i i was uh it was kind of a spooky experience
id10304_hDBMV_0Vz4E_00016.flac	it's uh doesn't happen a lot in one's uh career and uh to hit on something to be associated with
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00001.flac	very well because i didn't get to work with them at all so i didn't really get to know
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00002.flac	kickout of uh you know creating friendships with these people that i really haven't worked with before
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00003.flac	um but this this is a very funny movie and it's it was really a well
id10304_jUSC4i_eGHs_00004.flac	and can they can they make the next movie as good or better
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00002.flac	shows godspell and second city which was an institution moving to toronto and you know luckily i you know i i was able to kind of make both of those shows and those those were the uh the you know that's the first three or four years of my uh career kind of doin eight shows a week which which i i was really fortunate and then out of second city theater we of course uh
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00003.flac	developed and created our television show second city television which became tv and you know the rest kind of just rolles
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00004.flac	u no i mean i i sort of always knew that i wanted to um perform i didn't quite know in what capacity um and uh so in high school in college i was uh doing a lot of acting stuff and then got my job on mtv which was more of a hosting situation and that took about eight years
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00005.flac	took me away from the acting thing for a while and when i left mtv i got back into it and um about a year and a half into that uh i started working with my dad on this project and then a couple years later here we are so it's been
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00006.flac	well it's it's really a show about a a very wealthy

id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00009.flac	is uh is shits creek so it's really it's that fish out of water kindo situation but really it's about this family that never really functioned together as a family when they had money and now they're living in two ajoining motel rooms in shits
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00010.flac	four viertually incapable human beings trying to figure out what it's like to  you know live

id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00012.flac	um performances in this role uh of moyra rose uh she's incredibly funny and and insainely funny
id10304_o9bD_E99Jpg_00013.flac	um and and you know iand we've been it's true we've been working for years on the chris est movies and and even you know before that going back

id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00001.flac	to squeese you know a stage piece in  an we're really strapped for writing
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00002.flac	uh and a lot of times they just didn't work as well because they're stage pieces and of course we when we performed them we performed them at the same energy levl we  we wo on stage cause that's what we were used to doing they didn't work as well but the news piece was a great television uh adaptation because uh it was it was tv that we were doing on stage and when we just put it  in the show it worked pretty well i mean we started in show one and went right through the uh
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00003.flac	lin tang edith ly started as a stage uh character uh
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00004.flac	i don't remember but i but i u'm you're clarifying this for me which is which is great so then the show went
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00005.flac	it was a nice place whatever i don't know what the point is the point is i enjoyed my house i don't know whether theyr
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00006.flac	yo i could tell you what it was we had a pool we had a lovely cha who was living in the guest house  i don't think you really care about
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00007.flac	i i only did the shows when uh when andrewe uh called me to say do you wanna come up and do and and guess don some shows but beforehand i i had no intention of going back i just thought it was stupithetic
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00008.flac	this little thing but i did go up and guesst for a couple of weeks and i when i got up there i i i saw how the production had had
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00009.flac	it was amazing we'd never had production like this in toronno it wasyou know great direction great lighting great sets i mean it really looked dasiling and once i got up there i said wo
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00010.flac	you were took off you were in a bar you were you know this was we were working our asses off and thet
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00011.flac	t with him was was so much energy and enthusiasm that you know at this point round abouth our second a last season you know we were we were kind af getting tired and it was martie's energy
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00012.flac	and and and just positive vibe an attitude that kinda picked everybody up and now we had to kinda come back up to
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00013.flac	yes well that was nineteen eighty one juring tha kind of gen dimanian um
id10304_zV7LlMi0eHo_00014.flac	of the  uh just when the original cast had left right  nineteen seventy nine or something like that and the new cast came in new producer i did hear that that they wanted to put us in the saturday night eleven thirty time slot
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00001.flac	hyspanics you know do have uh some conservative values whether it's through religion or upbringing or community um we can't denye the fact that the most of the melineals are hyspanic the people that are coming up which means they're young which means they've grown up with ah a more tolerant view of the world whether it's sexual equality marriage equality equal pay uh reproduction rights i mean and i'm hoping that this youngger generation which tends to be largely
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00002.flac	um will help with uh with those issues that particularly we're having here in in texas so it'll be interesting i think i think you know ha
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00003.flac	votor education i mean just making them aware of how policies disproportionately affect them whether it's access to healthcare or access to quality education or access to um reproductive freedom um a lot of people wan no know how does this affect
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00004.flac	and i think that's all americans but specifically with his fanec so we wanna make sure that there's no apathy that theres uh there's true engagement and and knowing how does this affect your poketbook at the end of the day if you vote for this canadate this canadate has done this and this and this or this canadate has not passe this in this in this and so sometimes when you when you just break it down um into uh
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00005.flac	how does this affect me why should i vote you have to have a good answer for that and that's what everybody's out out there's asking especially in this bano community do i
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00006.flac	is interesting and effective because they're very grasruite oriented and i think that was the success of uh of being on the abama campain and seeing their their ground opperation um it really takes a dortodor approach and i think that's
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00007.flac	for lotl fun which helped funrased for the national election and we had such success we raised over thirty two million dollars uh with over a hundred and fifty thousand doners so that's a lot of donations and a lot of people that we went to uh for donations was were people who had never been asked before and so we tepped into a whole new uh not only doner bacse but a
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00008.flac	new community that wants to be involved and wants to have a voice um so after the national election was done we wanted to continue to uh harness these uh this new community that wanted to be involved and wanted to be engage and we decided to start the latino victory project and um it has two arms tere's a packside and then there's also uh a charity side in which we are trying to develop a pipeline of uh latino candadates who represent american values and we wannto support that pypeline of
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00009.flac	that wold be the gol we don't wanna have to go and targets certain races to make sure that aur canadates win and you know with citisens united and the amount of money being pored into certain campaines that doesn't necessarily produce the best candadate so latino victory project is having to go and support these canadates who really represent amazing american values but who are losing orr r in a really tyght race because of
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00010.flac	uh and so you know the ultimate dream is that we don't need a latino victory project and the
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00011.flac	whether it's sexual equality marriage equality equal pay uh reproduction rights i mean and i'm hoping that this younger generation which tends to be largely

id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00015.flac	peple have a plant they have uh an idea of what they need and where they need to go
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00016.flac	is interesting and effective because they're very grasruite oriented and i think that was the success of uh of being on the abama campain and seeing their their ground opperation um it really takes a dortodor approach and i think that's something
id10307_0nH78dDh0N0_00017.flac	bootl fun which helped funrase for the national election and we had such success we raised over

id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00001.flac	uh u that i was thinking of before the idea of telenavella uh came to mind but i was a very uh big fan of uh telonavella's growing up i was in a sope
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00002.flac	uh in my career fr one of the first breaks i got was young in the rest ofus uh and i loved uh behind the scenes comedies like sope dish and um thirty rock and sope in the seventies with um billy christal i mean there was alla tooky there was so many funny things that were happening behind the scenes way funnier than what was happening in front of the cameras and so i oalways thought o it would be funny to have a tv series
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00003.flac	where um uit was behind the scenes of a af a soppopper but instead of a normal sopopper what if it was a telonavella which is uh you know i think raiszes the stakes cause they're more melo dramatic and they're hightened and it's the most popular jan in the world and so we wanted to to celebrate it and this was like our big love
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00004.flac	ops we uh uh we definitely uh uh bring out whether it's a wind machine or a stardown or slapping
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00005.flac	thestories we get our real life things that have happened uh you know there was a a sup actress who would um a telo novella actress who would uh randamly slap people on scenes you never knew if you were gonna get slaped um there's another woman who would get up on ladders and move her own lights um another so uh telonovella actress who's assistant was poisoning her in real life so yeah
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00006.flac	uh yeah we we just kind of go oh let's just pull from this real
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00007.flac	so this is the first time i'm in a true half hour siccom comedy
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00008.flac	and of course physical i love physical comedy and when i read this script i thought oh my gosh i love i love ana sophia i love where her comedy comes from which is um herher insecurities
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00009.flac	um and her despiration to to wanna be more do more  and be relevant and so uh it was a lot of fun kind of flexing my my comedy mussls it is it is uh
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00010.flac	i fell off the bed i tweeked my shoulder i banged my ne um falling off a piano i mean it  it was uh it was a lot of fun though because it's um uside people kinda saw a little bit of and like
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00011.flac	but you yeaha comedy is all about timing and all about the rhythem of the words and the pase of the edeting and the pace of of um the camera choreographye so that's why i i wanted to produce the show that i was going to be in and that's why like producing comedyeis
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00013.flac	i love everything about hona sofhiea i you know what i love is she's exactly opposite of gabby um gabbie's rolice from housewives gabby was narcisistic and confident and
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00014.flac	she's super insecure she's super fragile she needs her friends she hides behind memi um she gets herself into trouble doesn' know how to crall out of it uh and that's been so much fun
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00015.flac	unexpected um i also you know i like that she's a fish out of water in this world which kindof comes from my upbringing i i grew up in texas not speaking spanish but yet being lethina so kind of never getting the joke or not really quite fitting in and having one foot in and one foot out and i feel like the future generations of hispanic in the united states feel that way they feel that you know i'm not as tied to my language or culture as
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00016.flac	so but i still feel liyou know i still feel mexican i still feel you know connected to my culture so uh when we did focus groups of the of the pilot that was one of the number one things ho spanics said was i love that hona sophea doesn't speak spanish because  i don't speak spanish but yet i am hispanic and i'm very proud of it and so it was uh interesting to see that that was uh
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00017.flac	does is really focuse on on two paths for women the first being their educational journey the second
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00018.flac	uh oncthreproni programs bcause lathina start small businesses at six times a national average and so they don't have access to capital they don't have access to business training so we wanna uh kind of nurture that but prior to that um just getting them out of high school is a challenge you know uh lathinos in the ounited states are um we have the the largest um
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00019.flac	the least access to highr education the least access to resources we you know the disparity
id10307_120gjdqGWNQ_00021.flac	family of women my mother's uh super strong i have nine ants i have three sisters so uh i

id10307_cR5FfR4TbEI_00006.flac	eighty twenty eighty percent filanthropy that's my that's my passhion it's my love i mean you know i grew up with a special need sister so i really care about the mental disability  community and special needs and downscin drem and then umh the l you kno community which i do a lot of advocacy and ativism for because um there's just still so much injustice and so i wanna
id10307_cR5FfR4TbEI_00007.flac	call me i say yes any time i call you yo say yes but like the main thing right now that i'm really pushing or two things well talk about
id10307_cR5FfR4TbEI_00008.flac	and uh and unfortunately the don't have the imfi structure uh to rebuild the homes fast and so we are trying to do a tent drive because rainy sesing season is starting in about a week and these people if you haven't died yet in  hatye you you have a high
id10307_cR5FfR4TbEI_00009.flac	i i ha i have given it thought i i i don't know what the answer is i find sometimes politicians are um locked into not helping as much as citisens i really believe power is in being a
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00001.flac	magic here but it's my first so it's my my you know first experience i think there's something beautiful to uh a recomitment
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00002.flac	to the people of this great nation and to see him uh you know do that today i saw vice president uh guitswarnan
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00003.flac	yeas and you know there's a lot of magic happening sona sot the myod being the first hispanic to swer ing to president was a big uh moment for us in in our communitye so there's a lot of first
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00004.flac	uh absolutely absolutely i mean i'm trying to do my part as a citizen and my part as a
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00005.flac	uh a hispannic and as a woman an as an american so um you know i enjoy it i think everybody should should
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00006.flac	civically engaged in a in a level that would affect policy that's the point that's that's how our government is
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00007.flac	nd uh you know there was a hystoric mobalization uh this election with the latino vote um
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00009.flac	coming around to the idea uh that they're going to have to compromise with the president on on a lot of issues imigration being one of them because imigration in particular uh i think the republicans are gonna realize if you know they don't do it because it's morally imperative they have to do it because it's politically imperative and if they're nt gonna do it because it's politically imperative they gotta do it cause it's economically imperative so there's a lot of gaines for everybody no matter what party affiliation to get this done and to fix this
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00010.flac	um but no uh no right now i'm i'm really i o i've always had the powers with the citizen um i love doing what i do i think you know it's
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00011.flac	it's interesting and uh and it's all of our responsibility to be involved in the way i'm i'm involved and uh you know i'm i'm i'm not running for office i i
id10307_c_aEjTGGhZ4_00012.flac	pliticians do i think it's a very very big job it's it's their day job it's not my day job so i'm just doing what i can to help uh the communities in in which
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00001.flac	uh hyspanics you know do have uh some conservative values whether it's through religion or upbringing
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00002.flac	our community um we can't denye the fact that the most of the melineals are hyspanic the people that are coming up which means they're young which means they've grown up with a a more tolerant view of the world whether it's sexual equality marriage equality equal pay uh reproduction rights i mean and i'm hoping that this younger generation which tends to be largely hi
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00003.flac	um will help with uh with those issues that particularly we're having here in in texas so itt'll be interesting i think i think you know
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00004.flac	is votor education i mean just making them aware of how policies disproportionately affect them whether it's acess to health care or access to quality education or access to uh
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00005.flac	to have a good answer for that and that's what everybody's out out there 's asking especially in this banot community do i
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00006.flac	a question that it it disemfranchizes a certain population uh whether you're por or you're u a person of color or you live in rural
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00008.flac	pr this documentation this recumentation so um that's what we're doing today is really going out and making sure people have a plan that they have uh an idea of what they need and where they need to go and uh how long it will take and that they can really a lot a lot of the time
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00009.flac	is interesting and effective because they're very grasruit oriented and i think that was the success of uh uf being on the abma campain and seeing their their ground opperation um it really takes a dortodor approach and i think that's something
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00011.flac	that would be the gol we don't wanna have to go and targets certain races to make sure that our canadates win and you know with citisens united and the amount of money being pored into certain campaines that doesn't necessarily produce the best candadate so latino victory project is having to go and support these canadates who really represent amazing american values but who are loosing orror in a really tyght race because of
id10307_f8Ms66atECE_00012.flac	uh and so you know the ultimate dream is that we don't need a latino victory project in the future that uh it's a fair playing ground with people who are
id10307_hs255kxqdIA_00001.flac	socially um constructed that way to just be inferior or or subserviant and you don't have to be you can be yourself and and really hold your own by yourselfn no matter
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00001.flac	that's a that's a litt a bi question it's a big question too and and i think there's so much mis information out there and and i
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00002.flac	not the expert in this fieeld although i i am prettyliterate i'm pretty literate in in this particular issue um because of of people that are in my life and my mentors and and people that i surround myself with because i really wanna un
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00003.flac	i think created a dialoge that we needed to have and and for imigration um it'spent on the administration on the ogenda for the
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00004.flac	inherited a a lot of problems it's i's not easy being the presint of ounited states um you know theire disappointment because imigration reform has not been tackled i uh yes there is but people have to understand the history of imigration in our country and so a lot of the people that are speaking out about it even on on this
id10307_kp_GCjLq4qA_00005.flac	th channels they don't understand the history especially of mexicans our mexican americans and
id10307_nyOSk9wr50I_00001.flac	um no it's a workplace comedy very broad i play the star of this spanish sopeopper
id10307_p_ifY8mUFBM_00001.flac	i come from a very filanthropic family my older sister had special needs and so we were always involved in giving back and and within
id10307_p_ifY8mUFBM_00002.flac	community and community programs and so for me uh this was such a natural
id10307_tiC1AaHnX7A_00001.flac	reay oh yeah she was a wonderful n she is a wonderful woman um
id10307_wDlr75yk6Iw_00001.flac	like their mindreaders they're so good my sistents are so good they're i go i need it and then they'll hand it
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00001.flac	uh about a telonovella which is a spanish soke opera so it's a work place comedy set behind behind the scenes of a telonovella
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00002.flac	who plays the star of the spanish sope that we are behind the cenes of uh she doesn't speak spanish she's very assimilated um but she has found herself here uh having fame and startem on this spanish sope opra uh she's insecure am
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00003.flac	it's a lot of fun she's clumsy uh she's funny um she relies heavily on this work place family um if it wasn't for these people that she works
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00004.flac	um and uh and really making s walking the line of honoring the
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00005.flac	uhin and making sure that the sise of our comedy is broad enough for everybody but specific enough to to make
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00006.flac	really was excited to discover new talent i was excited to
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00007.flac	zacry levi is one of my favoride human beings in the world as well he i love zacry leviy we've known each
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00008.flac	since before desperate housewives he was on a show called less than perfect and i was on
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00009.flac	on abc and we've known each other you know since then and became fast friends and long time
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00010.flac	and when we had this role um we thought oh my gosh you know who'd be great is zacry lebi and he was told thet he was like yeah
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00011.flac	he plays the president of the spanish net work and he's a white guy who speaks
id10307_wtqPC9vEZ0M_00012.flac	and i play ona sophia who uh is the star of this spanish sope who does not speak
id10307_x5H4xfXTh-I_00001.flac	i mean doesn't mean i'l answer it yeah but iy but yeah i learn that in pagents how to pivit it's
id10307_x5H4xfXTh-I_00002.flac	always talked about the drama behind the scenes but they never they would never do that about a show about men
id10307_xypgI0Y-bFA_00001.flac	um i'm i was surprised there was even a trial in that it went that far because i love nicholet and i love mark cherry and i love our
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00001.flac	my name because it changed so many times and we never used the name jill we called each other inske cause that's my last name was jill
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00002.flac	um agent   souh agent marnt see it changed like  agent maran that's what they call me so always forget my name was jill um
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00003.flac	is uh a rooky secret service agent who was assined to kefer and on her first day underneath kefer there's a scandl that breaks out that there's a mole in the secret service
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00004.flac	a little bit yeah i was excited to venture away from desperate housewives for a movie um and specifically early on in our desperate housewives phenomenalnd i wanted to kind of branch out before people could only see me as gabriel and i think this movie does that
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00005.flac	extremely hard um this year i'm having a difficult time trying to fit in a movie um because our hitas gets shorter and shorter caus we're doing more and more episodes and we have more and more countries to um you know hator to and so it's really uh been difficult but u you know i'm not complaining my life is just
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00006.flac	t that a girl outshot him but you know women in general are better shooters because they have a calmer hand they don't have the adrennalin that the men do but i mneaw i grew up
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00007.flac	h just really comfortable with it and i think it's important in movies like this that you sell it um that you sell the fact that you're comfortable and you are that person you have gone through that training because you can tell right away
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00008.flac	the character that um she not used her looks to get her way and that she is respected for her skill and her talent and and it is true cause we got to meet a lot of secret service um agents that are curently
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00009.flac	n employed and the it is tough it is a tough tough job and you don't get anywhere by
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00010.flac	you know only the best of the best will survive in this organization and so um to play it any other way would be a dis service
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00011.flac	um well like i said i'm a rooky and i'm assined to keepfer who's not really happy about it at the beginning until he discovers i'm actually um beneficial to have around because he can't trust
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00012.flac	the movie while he's solving this mystery except for me cause i'm um not jaded and i'm untainted by any influence so he learns to trust me and then i also studied with michel
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00013.flac	i in my backstory you know that i' actually uh highly respect who michael's character was so i'm kind of caught in the middle because they're not a seeing ida eye on things and i'm trying to keep peace through the movie and and and really uh expose the truth of whath
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00014.flac	and it's just high action u you wantt you
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00015.flac	you you can't stop thinking and and wondering also you can't trust anybody you know you might think it's me you might think it's michal you think it's kefer so you don't know who it is
id10307_yUv37vQWmzE_00016.flac	anand very flattering ins you know because i grew up as the u uggly duckling and and
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00001.flac	well i think because they're opposites in some senses because he's someone who's always worried he's always his his brain is always in conflict and that comes across when you read the books it's sort of it's almost tiring because he never stops thinking about he's really consienscious and he has to like herminy tells me he's a saving person thing and he does um where as luna really goes with the flow you know she's where everyone's worried about being
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00002.flac	she can do to stop um the events that infold she just enjoys them and um she i think she helps harry com down and realize he can
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00003.flac	lenas dad u you know filious and it's just so much fun being part of the love good clan i think um and being being luna you sometimes feel like you're the outsideor o just something that goes with her um but when it was with her dad i felt really relaxed
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00004.flac	different it's not like any of the ones before because they're not at howarts anymore and the sense that um it's this it's the seventh book so a and this was the big question when the book came out would harry live or diye and that's the thing in the film you
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00005.flac	there's no jumble dor the the weselies are gone there's no one to protect them and you have that sense that they're these teenagers out in the world and they
id10308_MxBuaaxNnlE_00006.flac	bpand hagrid i can't really get my old pictures in the head uh but the ones who  friends wisthat they they in in the book they they're not their
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00001.flac	i think he's a little bit self conscious you know u and everyone's against him in the fifth book and he doesn't want
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00002.flac	siby her and she she's wise she his really good insight into people
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00003.flac	cause she doesn't have any friends and then when shehr she likes harry you know and then
id10308_S5BJ45l7wWY_00004.flac	doing this ime she wanted to go like to learn the magic but also to make friends you know she likes she's not the loner although she's
id10308_Tzs_CTbHT9Y_00001.flac	kind of the uh i don't know no one likes me i'm the very like
id10308_We7oIBrKQKg_00001.flac	yeah i learned to remember that by by having that by not worrying you you save yourself a lot of trouble
id10308_We7oIBrKQKg_00002.flac	they don't do anything they're trying to protect us from from failing what they
id10308_We7oIBrKQKg_00003.flac	change she's she's too much at one with herself that she doesn't need to so um and people just wor lik always asking the caw tos gonna be the
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00001.flac	almost a little bit i was a little bit at first like oh that's a bit you know i don't but i i i i think coming back herefr when i' like that was before i came back and when i came back here two days ago and and sawit and met the people who are running it i'm just i'm really happy now tat this and i'm happy that it's it's become a studio tour so that it's always gonna be there it's not like packed in boxes and it's not like it never
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00002.flac	it's like levestan i's now the home of harry potter which is such a nice thing and we've also we've seen some of the people coming through
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00003.flac	and their reactions are just amazing and and so rewarding and it's like it's almost
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00004.flac	yeah absolutely um walking through the great hall especially there's i remember all the scenes i had i did with friends and and like
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00005.flac	was in and i loved those scenes where everyone came back cause most of my scenes were ether like just with dan or wt the
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00006.flac	up the d members six of them umd but these ones are always everyone
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00007.flac	love the creature shop and i think from a favorite in the creature shop
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00008.flac	the fenics um he's really really beautiful and um yeah he just
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00009.flac	he's so cool and um i just  think they've taken all his personality and his his interests into account when they've built that set
id10308_XQWpVt5n3Ic_00010.flac	play the sims a lot i like some racecar games
id10308_igRoN6MXsWo_00001.flac	entranced by the fantasy and and the world that jake roland created
id10308_igRoN6MXsWo_00002.flac	no you know yeah a fantasy world that that we don't experience i i think it
id10308_igRoN6MXsWo_00003.flac	it's interesting it's like an escape but it's not that you relate to it and she's creat  some
id10308_p1RiXPsSp4E_00001.flac	french and i have my place but i just think at the moment it's a really good time to
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00001.flac	the the whole film is just towards this battle it's really big and
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00002.flac	the thete special effects worked really well with this and and the three d i was i was bit um scheptical about the three d effects butit works really well um and yeah
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00003.flac	that you you'll just see every every character kind of get there und get a moment in it  and it's surprising cause it there is so much to pack in but um all the ki characters that've been there throughout the series they they all come into their o
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00004.flac	she's gonna be wherever she's meant to be um and and and she doesn't  that's what you never see her worried she's always just quite relaxed and even in the battl scenes she she'll never start sobing hysterically cause she's always very sort of
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00005.flac	can only be positive and and it's the right way of thinking like worry gets doesn't get anyone anywhere
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00006.flac	and i i think i think she's a very spiritual character that um she she and ls the way she she sees herself where as
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00007.flac	um they don't have all this self dot or self unxter and think that som people in our
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00008.flac	because they believe you know they're part of nature and they're perfect for that reason and that's the way luna is and that's why she's always so calm and trusting um so yeah i think faite is a big part and i think hermiony i jake
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00009.flac	when there's no evidence purely because there's no evidence to the contrary she just likes to keep an opon mind whereis her myniy everything has to be like
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00010.flac	it all his his the whole purpouse of his life is so
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00011.flac	it all his his the whole purpouse of his life is so deeply rouited in his past and it's
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00012.flac	such a long strech of time um and i think yeah it's just  amazing a and as harry says he was the bravest man he knew thate gave up his whole life
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00013.flac	like when i would put on her clotes tis just really colorful and and and bright and so unlike what anyone else would wear
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00014.flac	things and and and it's it's it's lovely it's such a relief to to not because um i suppose i would generally borry more than her and and
id10308_rgpPBT4yQcg_00015.flac	you're being talked about and you're worrying what are people saying um and but when i'm playing luna i don't have that
id10308_sGqnn4WpQCI_00001.flac	i'm always like working with he's older veteran actors but i os  mothervit them i o
id10308_sGqnn4WpQCI_00002.flac	so um yeah and i remember my my meeting with him on fred ary ri cray the first time it was a my screen test so i hadn't even got o the park then so asside from being just terrified just like and parolized with nerves about actually audition
id10308_sGqnn4WpQCI_00003.flac	o he iit was just like it was that day wats such a bler and um i remember coming in like havin got my costume on i'm like just
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00001.flac	i did i had two butter bears we were we were on stage we were doing am a live fleaky
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00002.flac	yeah it's it's it's even worse you know because i i've had this not just for the films i've had it since i was eight so i mean i don't even really know what kind of person i was before i had harry potter
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00003.flac	cause is my last stop on the hary potter tour cause the premire it's really fun but you don't see a lot of your friends it's so huge and and just lots of people you don't know where it
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00004.flac	and and and it it was lovely cause it's like i have been feeling quite down about this going i like some after the first
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00005.flac	experience gong yeah and going through and that you can talk to someone that thatd say how sad
id10308_sLv-3TCu2fE_00006.flac	i did the line hat i designe that um but  you know  i hope that people take
id10308_sy19cFuDvX8_00001.flac	she really likes it cause bcause she doesn't have any friends and then when she hert she likes hery
id10308_sy19cFuDvX8_00002.flac	was doing this army she wanted to go like to learn the magic but also to make friends you know she likes she's not a loner although she's alone she
id10308_vbxURBaCGr0_00001.flac	for all the love you've shown to me and to all the membors of the harry botter cast and um yeah thank you for passing
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00001.flac	it's made that more clearo having the park here like actually going from the moal world to the wisarding world and that's why people everyone sort of wants to
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00002.flac	go into acting if it hadn't been for this so it really pushed me into this and i' a i love
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00003.flac	a lttle bit like inside out but it was more just the child in me coming aut and playing and i didn't know how to approach a a character whoh it was already like u
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00004.flac	really had a connection with um so that was just the kind of i kind of i did something that was
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00005.flac	small scale because i wanted to just aexpore and i found it
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00006.flac	challenging it was uh because it wasn't and also because it was just a
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00007.flac	scale projects is that you have to be so much more responsible like were of yourself you have to look at it for yourselve because they don't have the lugury of time to
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00008.flac	tinstkep going over things and um sometimes it it it cadnt come out looking awful whereis a hard
id10308_ygGJs_Rh7ds_00009.flac	like great so yeah it there was a certain i i felt more i had more creative freedom i
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00001.flac	uh listen to the audio books the performances by jim daile of the american aditions of the books countless times i mean we're talking about numbers in the
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00002.flac	hearsals almost as someone who's been in the deasert for so long and percival graves who is a smart man perseeves this and is exploiting it by saying hey you in the deasart here is water
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00003.flac	but graves also need something from creedence there's a
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00004.flac	that seems to be the dynamic of this mutual reliance that then starts to crumble as they both start to realize or to think that the other one does not have what they
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00005.flac	uh incredibly fun we had a a really really wonderful time fleshing it out in rehearsal uh and realizing it on the day we really we would we were very exporative um david would give us a lot of angles to play with the scene from
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00006.flac	very attentive probably like every single person who worked on this film very attentive to trying to
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00007.flac	the suttlties of the dinamic as it was written because that's the amazing thing about jakha roling's work is
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00008.flac	and they had the bull horn and they were yealling mean things at people
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00009.flac	immage david yates is the antythsis of that immage he is the opposite of all of those
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00010.flac	incredibly quiet he maintaines an incredibly quiet set the fhocus on the work is is really strong he's very sweet and kind and warm loving and supportive but at the same time he is a director who will challenge you and will accept nothing less than the best and most authentic performance that you're capable of that day
id10309_0b1inHMAr6o_00011.flac	and i'd accept the note and then he'd walk away and i'd go wait a second how did he know what i was
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00001.flac	in a sense when we really love a a story we all step into
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00002.flac	i don't know for me a lot of my material in this film is just conversations between two people u a lot of the other actors has a had a lot more to sort of fill in the blanks of in their mind but i will say that what i did do
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00003.flac	owork with the visual effects department was really collaborative and they were always trying to let us know what things would look like and they were watching our performances also to inform how they were going to make these images
id10309_0cYFdtyWVds_00005.flac	cause  remember on the playground  two people who disagree about what you're imagining you're like no my son li
id10309_0wLebLY6tcM_00001.flac	sort of had a moment of temporary insanity and jubilee on the street
id10309_3qX7bbJ17lY_00001.flac	w i wanted to do it just seeing this like muckraking aspiring investigative radical journalist who was obsessed with hunres
id10309_3qX7bbJ17lY_00002.flac	nzoidieology of putting himself as this over dramatized character that you know he
id10309_3qX7bbJ17lY_00003.flac	uh you know this power is corrupting him and what what was supposed to be a movement is becoming
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00001.flac	person um because i i think people are naturally
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00002.flac	level there's an awaireness in a baby u baby when even when a child is born that's a a nine month progressed organism with a u
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00003.flac	removed from kind of what makes us human we're becoming less and less
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00004.flac	ct can can be forgiven i mean because because w we can all on some level
id10309_GyJHpVQmcvc_00005.flac	these are incredibly delicate and complex
id10309_MJ3skMKNBGM_00001.flac	uh that's that burdy was yes that berty was honest with you i don't know how that bird got all that information
id10309_MJ3skMKNBGM_00002.flac	uh i yeah i'm a huge herry putter fan i was i still
id10309_MJ3skMKNBGM_00003.flac	from nineteen twenty six new york some long underware because i really like old school long underware they're so stylish you can just wear them as pants you look
id10309_RWpuDFuKFjY_00001.flac	play credence barbone and he's sort of a sad character he's grown
id10309_RWpuDFuKFjY_00002.flac	city part of the enchantment so i can fit anything in there but then it is extremely
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00001.flac	uh the people in history who who might have actually had some magical
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00002.flac	getting out of control sort of falling out of line uh and how that's how how evolution happens on et
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00003.flac	often having rather mysorable lives and being regected by society and
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00004.flac	in some cases triumphing an and managing to find joy but always outside of
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00005.flac	but  it's almost like cretan's got mess cren's got left behind or marry wod
id10309_RkN41E3gRpc_00006.flac	what they could have been if they were never subjected to that drama is tragic and then thinking about
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00001.flac	it's somewhat like a valve remember in band class at school when the the grose woodwin seton would have the spit valve remember they'd have to let out the spit
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00002.flac	drift off and start playing with a prop or they're staring at
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00003.flac	s the body all art is made by the body if we're a singer we're dancing with our vocal cords if we're
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00004.flac	and for me what i guess what i was interested in or what i'm becoming more and more interested in is like a lot of times in acting we talk about setting intention so like what is your character's motivation in this scene which is great and is important um but for me what i'm becoming more interested in is instead of intention paying attention and paying attention to the body
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00005.flac	like kno a we need you to run we have this enormous treadmill i thing that's called a
id10309_V_tzoDBiP8A_00006.flac	meets visual effects and what we're trying to imploment is a wide diversity of tactics of how
id10309_VxiCsd0gA6o_00001.flac	t i don't know how exciting that biopat would really be od just be like me growing up in suberban new jersy andn like getting some role mean like how did this
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00001.flac	we think we live in the coolest craziest city in the world and the most lively vibrant city in the world ad
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00002.flac	this city is so amazing and there's so much going on
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00003.flac	yeah it has all the energy and all the vibrants of new york but maybe
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00004.flac	i certainly uh had that period i remember when i was about thirteen years old
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00005.flac	everybody had an identity everybody had these opinions
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00006.flac	and so i started to have my own opinions and i started to sort of carve out my own
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00007.flac	you know i had to pretend like i hated the music my parents liked even though before then and now again now i can admit it's
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00008.flac	good looks can only get you so far and often people don't
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00009.flac	like girls with artistic sensibility and who make art and i tend to
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00010.flac	love or relate to someone else if you can't first love and relate to
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00011.flac	actors who trust to their instincts and working with
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00012.flac	that there is nothing more important you can intelectualize and think about a characterr a
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00013.flac	the best thing you can do is let your inturnal away
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00014.flac	and to listen and to to pay attention to the other actors because there's a danger in thinking too much uh
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00015.flac	that you will ignore what's really happening and you'll miss
id10309_XMLMvfrgdzY_00016.flac	houghman i say it all the time i say it when i'm alone you know i'll just i'll just be like you knowi'
id10309_Zx-zA-D_DvI_00001.flac	like a like a maniacal like a phenaticaldea i would would listen to the audion boos almost every day of my life for
id10309_Zx-zA-D_DvI_00002.flac	isn't even like a serial bole this is like a a bol you'd put some sort of sauce or guarnish in very
id10309_Zx-zA-D_DvI_00003.flac	connects maybe this doesn't ounek maybe i'm just talking about it because i'm obsessed with
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00001.flac	an audition that involved doing an improvisation with just a couple
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00002.flac	conspiracy uh david yates and david haymon they came to new york and we met
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00003.flac	a missfit sort of by designe and a couple differet ways i had a breathwine stutter when i
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00004.flac	oming out of the opera i was beginning to have questions about my sexuality and was
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00005.flac	kiss boys sometimes and that didn't help
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00006.flac	tunity to see things uh more clearly from afar with a grandour perspective but we shouldn't disco
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00007.flac	to that sort of invention or creativity um and in fact makes people feel really stifeled and like they have to be outside of society uh in order to express
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00008.flac	uh rut of the problems in our world and i think we can see the corolation pretty
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00009.flac	most prominently circuses and bars its teeith that's always gonna be tied into masaginy and if we don't adress masaginy then
id10309__z_BR0ERa9g_00010.flac	itit all intersects all issues intersect with the opression of women uan female b
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00001.flac	because i had a speech impedement and that almost throug me off
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00002.flac	ih've remained um at least partially immersed in that world my
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00003.flac	um even in my most rebelious adolesscent times i would still
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00004.flac	you know i mean i was uh i wanted to when i heard about this movies existance i just wanted to be in it whatever way i could i never dream there was gonna be a role that would be my age and would be so
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00005.flac	so then when i had had done an initial audition and went and talked to the venerable conspirasy of davids uh that is hamon and
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00006.flac	satern because it was just so intriguing and exciting and sounded like this really beautiful metepfore for something that i knew in a certain way um
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00007.flac	but when it comes time to work there is a focus and an intensity there's just a raw power honestly that
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00008.flac	that he has and he channels um that so when yeah when the scene would start and he would become graves it was such a complet transformation energetically you could feel
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00010.flac	you know form a a just very friendly bond with him uh
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00011.flac	you know creedences is drawn to graves and doesn't really see the he feels the sinister but doesn't really connect with it or identify
id10309_e-IdJ8a4gy4_00012.flac	uh contexts you know that are some of my um come from some of my favorite works and some of my
id10309_nMZkxUQ1RqI_00001.flac	evil and bary is just getting into it andit seems exciting and very
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00001.flac	i remember when i told my dad i was eight and i was like dad i'm going to be a performer ajustc
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00002.flac	hmand and him being initially kind of taken aback but then having a real really quickly coming to the conclusion allowed that like that is
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00003.flac	and i remember when my dad said that to me like feeling like sort of like a a
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00004.flac	y yeah i was right there though i was on the cuss nineteen ninety one i was
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00005.flac	thati i think that makes us less whole uh as as people i i
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00006.flac	resicaling these these we keep drawing these battllines um
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00007.flac	human beings are amazing and love is an is an honor and an and an opportunity
id10309_pwfqGqgezH4_00008.flac	e different songs but i would when i was a kid i would only let him sing one song n it was a song hi used to fall asleep to  uh
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00001.flac	very interesting again very challenging but very intriguing
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00002.flac	so amazing really to play a character who's you know i've played dark sad upset disturbed um characters of other varieties before
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00003.flac	but this was six months of shooting you know which is very different
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00004.flac	in terms of the the execution of it for more than a couple months in terms of
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00005.flac	returning to creedences body uh brought up challenges for me that i didn't expect um in terms of
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00006.flac	working on this film and she was very generous with me she became in many ways um my uh
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00007.flac	fairy godmother in england even as she was playing my bad fostermother in new york um so
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00008.flac	yeah and just an unbelievable opportunity to work
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00009.flac	um an incredible channel in to many art forms i mean i think what's amazing about sam is that she's every medium she's music and she's
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00010.flac	for she you know creates film and she's constantly writing and she's uh constantly creating and when she she and so when she comes to uh a project it
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00011.flac	like she just brings all of these all  these incredible resources and she had some experiences in her life that were almost paralelle to credences experience and so she was very excited to play this role because she was almost able to
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00012.flac	and i feel only comfortable saying something like that just because she's she's spoken of it
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00013.flac	and so she his th she had this deep understanding of these dynamics that she was actually able to share with me and which she was actually very helpful for me in in the formation of my
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00014.flac	it's so cool i mean it's so cool honestly this year has been so
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00015.flac	but inevitably fall into um it's been u fantastic year uh tu ut going from fantastic beasts
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00016.flac	there to this very different space i mean in in every way the tone
id10309_qFrRfhWombs_00017.flac	uh the character uh the physicality it's all amost
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00001.flac	it's more than you ever really even allow yourself to dream
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00002.flac	to good to be true i can't really describe the feeling it's it's like butterflys but the're
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00003.flac	uh daily confront the reality of abuse uh
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00004.flac	and then to victimize that other uh instad of dealing with ourselves
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00005.flac	it's easy to sort of not pay attention to the fact that that's happening in so many of the homes across
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00006.flac	you kno but it's real and it's something that that we have to deal with so yeah a lot of my my
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00007.flac	called childline in the uk who are ther ar response and out reach program for
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00008.flac	bn har there are organizations like that that exist all around the world where you can find um support networks uh for people who are survivers of abiuse um and i'm really grateful chchildline let me sort of talk to some of their responders and then also
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00009.flac	some survivors also talking to some people in my life who are survivers in a a similar way like a really similar way to credence that specifically in fostercare you know the trama of
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00010.flac	of losing or never having your your biological family uh um but then the process of going from family to family and sometimes these people come out foster care with the wrong intentions and so all that was the hardest part dealing with that confronting that because i i just found that
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00011.flac	problem in our world and it's on michrocosms in homes and then it's the macrocosm
id10309_rqaAm4bEsXc_00012.flac	uh that we create just parent to child parent to child care
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00001.flac	yeah probably the voum definitely i was i was gonna
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00002.flac	yeah i mean and that's that's true  i mean it shouldidn't be this was this artform actory if you think about what it is in a basic form it shouldn't be a a beauty

id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00006.flac	bs kids kids play and when kids play they make believe and they put themselves into this
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00007.flac	time to stop playing make believe and um i was really lucky to find when i was like

id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00012.flac	see the final result and it's so you know like moving and a
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00013.flac	an and you like when you know i feel so proud of this film every time that happens i feel like i become like it reenforces my will to be
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00014.flac	uh that whoever had oo whatever the brain
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00015.flac	yo kno the there were therer it was only so far you could go wrong with what wed done out
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00016.flac	i certainly did not expect how far right it had gone
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00017.flac	i mean i was crying when the film ended um and i i
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00018.flac	and there was this young girl who
id10309_rxnN8thYzEQ_00019.flac	bout this film was made for one kid in nabraska yes and we're trying desperately to
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00001.flac	love to be able to do like the ingorgio and ridocto spell
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00002.flac	just to make things different sises so i'd like to right now be able to make you very
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00003.flac	i wouldhave just clung to ron pirlman's head uh and played an er uh if that's what i had to do to be involved in fantastipes and where to find hem
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00004.flac	the fact that the character was a dream role for any actor was just a very very luscious iscing on an already
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00005.flac	was really fantastic when you see nineteen twenties underware uh
id10309_tGEWD2GaiDw_00006.flac	you understand that they had they knew things
id10309_uTOEzdTJNmU_00001.flac	ii i don't identify with that i i think that makes us less whole
id10309_uTOEzdTJNmU_00002.flac	human beings are amazing and love i's an is an honor and an and an opportunity and and a fragile thing uh
id10309_uTOEzdTJNmU_00003.flac	no i mean i i i i guess i mean um someone else
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00001.flac	you know drink from that well um and draw an information en get
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00002.flac	o but i would certainly preorder them on line at the first available opportunity uh and would wait for them egorly like go and check the maile box long before it was possible that they would be there that sort of thing or is the kid you waitr
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00003.flac	yeah and yeah i would would listen to the audio books almost every day of my life for several years embarassingly
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00004.flac	in in one way or an other especially when we are children we have such an access point to magic through our uh
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00005.flac	is brought back to the true magic that we all partake of uh reminded again
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00006.flac	love and again and again that its that it's friendship you know and that
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00007.flac	cl imagination of what magic could be but then ultimately were always brought back to the true magic
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00008.flac	i think that is a truth that can be found through a lot of the wisdom traditions of the world those uh people who do practice magic um i think would agree with jak
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00009.flac	thereis uh something at the rouit which has to do with how human beings have this dangerous tendency to seperate ourselves from the world and the beings around us
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00010.flac	with seperation um we lose awareness and with a loss of awareness we become frightened because and and when we're frightened we offten uh lash out or demonize or target what we're frightened of and
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00011.flac	you know purmiating all culture is this dangerous element of seeing someone else as completely seporate from yourself losing awareness of how those people are different but at the rouit always the same and then deamonizing and targeting other people
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00012.flac	uh the dangers in the world that jkay roling seems to time and time again direct our attention to and what a great time for this film to come out as
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00013.flac	the situation is unbelievably dirk um we've we've lost half the
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00014.flac	no matter what no matter how quickly we can pull it together or
id10309_vobW27_-JyQ_00015.flac	our you know ship on this destructive path where
