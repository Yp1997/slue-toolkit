id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00002.flac	more carelessness in a good way in the best possible way and people like figuring it out and then i think it's really
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00003.flac	uh maybe the talent or the you know i haven' really found out what i'm trying to say yet but still like kind of dipping your to in here and there and not really figuring out what is you wanna say i mean that's i feel like that's probably inevitable if anyone that
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00004.flac	not really finding your voice yet that's like a very aukward you know time
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00005.flac	urehow it all worked out i feel like i was in a coma and woke up when it was done when we came into shooting  we did the preerecords and that was pretty sireal and
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00006.flac	isolate it like you know however however it is they shoot it but i i don't remember doing it uh so much you know but they had a very clear vision of what he what they kind af wanted it to be and what they were going for so clear ing what their story
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00007.flac	the good thing i really did i was just like not really get involved so much
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00008.flac	and and sit back as much as possible cause i don't listen to music the way that those guys
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00009.flac	obviously inl um but i just don't hear it how how some people do and that's always kind
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00010.flac	actually rock monaoff i would say that was like the first uh uim notandn you can't say that without sonding like a protentious as but like that's so true like i
id10012_0AXjxNXiEzo_00011.flac	um listed to a lot of secular music growing up uh but uh but like rock man os ther concharto i like i listen to all the time

id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00002.flac	living in the back room of my parents house paying rent in the small town i was raised in northern indiana called micawaka i could spell
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00003.flac	stories about of actor's moving to lay with like seven dollars and finding work and successful careers i got as far as amarillo texus before my car broke down i spent
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00004.flac	monica not even ella stayed for forty ight hours wandering the beach basically got my car drove home thus
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00005.flac	again this is me i thought all sivillian problems are small compared to the military and e
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00006.flac	by how complex the transition was from military to sevilian and i was relatively healthy i can't imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injery but regardless it was difficult in part because i was in acting school i couldn't justify going to voice and speech class throwing imaginary balls of
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00007.flac	marin where you're shooting machine guns and firing morters its not a lot of places you can put those
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00008.flac	everything has meaning everything you do is ither steeped in tradition or has a practical purpos and you can't smoke in the fieeld because ou don't wan na give away your
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00009.flac	he're you're just another body and i felt like i constently had to prove my worth all over again and the respect sovilians were given me while i was in uniform didn't exist while i was out of it
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00010.flac	w are you putting a life orde situation when u with your closest friends and they constantly demonstrat that they're not gonna abandon you and
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00011.flac	experience in a way that before to me  was indescribable and i felt myself becoming less ogressive as i was able to put words to feelings for the first time and realizing what a valuable tool that was and when i was reflecting on my time
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00012.flac	ther familyes friends getting divorced grieving together celebrating together all within the backdrop of the
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00013.flac	started this non profical arts and the arm forces where where we tried to do that tryed to join these two seemingly
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00014.flac	trained actors arm them with incredible material keep production value as minimal as possible no sets no costumes no
id10012_nCwwVjPNloY_00015.flac	on having acronms for acronims can get lost in the sause when it comes to explaining a collective experience and i can think of no better community to arm with a new means of
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00001.flac	an he's like i've been thinking about this for you know thirty years this is how the movie is gonna be but that it was almost the exact
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00002.flac	and he still kind of approach scenes with like an attitude of he didn't know what the answer would be and that
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00003.flac	hope to see in practice but to but to watch someone who h's accomplished so much in his career ord been thinking about these characters and knew knew his material so well still approach
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00004.flac	um so you kind of go in you can't help but go in with like a preconcieved idea of that
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00005.flac	you know demystifying himself and making it about you know focusing on the details
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00006.flac	weirdly paternal thing that happens or it maybe the actor director relationship where you away
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00007.flac	and he's my age so i hate him but i'm one of my favorite
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00008.flac	um they had us they had the front of the boat tied to a big rope that they pushed out into the water and we were shooting this scen wheretheyr
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00009.flac	no when you're losing waight it's all about timing you know like you have to time
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00010.flac	and the rest of the casts and extras are are all kind of on the
id10012_o-8xXV5MC8I_00011.flac	on the uh on the shor and they call  lunch break when they readthis a couple times and so it

id10014_RbXXh_l-qH8_00005.flac	it's gonna do a number to um to the agency and and it's kind of really spice things up a little bit there's so much happening every which way
id10014_RbXXh_l-qH8_00006.flac	it was like garilla shootig i mean we shot seven scenes u you know from the time the sun came up to the you know came down we were there for two
id10014_RbXXh_l-qH8_00007.flac	it was kind of insaine but it was really fun and energetic and it's such a beautiful mlace

id10014_RbXXh_l-qH8_00010.flac	and and it's a really specific world that people really wan na be a part of and be able to talk you knowhan i came into this i'm not big and to social media at all and people who  followed my to what are w nderstand like you know any year i think i tweated six times but this has gotten me into it because you do a lot of live tweeting and to see what people are actually hin king in the moment watching it interacting and it's it's insaine to see how seriously people take it and and it kind of warms your heart in a way to see how much your
id10014_RbXXh_l-qH8_00011.flac	i think it's just such a broad world i mean you can bring anything into it it's ever changing i mean over the course of years you can do anything lith a comic and and the way that they've been able to with sg and special effects what they are now really make it feel like you're watching a comicb and change you know people's faces you know this world has become real
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00001.flac	they don't know about each other and you fall in love with this guy you fall in love with him cause he actually is so endeering and loves these two
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00002.flac	i don't because i think it happens all the time actually i
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00003.flac	when you're in love with somebody it's so easy to just kind of overlook certain things as we do a lot of times
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00004.flac	my character cat is uh she comes from a very wealthy family her father played by jon john voit um is the owner of the biggest oil company in texas and she's
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00005.flac	you know she's come from society but she's not necessarily a society girl she's incredibly brilliant she um
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00006.flac	um and youknow she's kind of the thregeline of the family she's the thread
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00007.flac	honestly i i was really kind of opposed to doing television again only cause i'd had such an amazing experience in ferienlightes and i didn't wanna you know ruin that um
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00008.flac	never know it's gonna happen and you're stuck for seven years ultimately you know it's not a movie you can jut
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00009.flac	um my manager really was just like please read this please read
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00010.flac	it was so well written and well done and ultimately my biggest question
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00011.flac	he was just like okay poor family and e actually he didn't sign on right away he really wanted to come down and meet the whole cast before he did that and immediately he met us
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00012.flac	i mean nothing compares to the way that we shot that show it's um it was brilliant as an actor you get to really grow and and it's like acting class
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00013.flac	sides to it we do have certain freedoms that we don't
id10014_iZ6XrudZsSw_00014.flac	it was so wonderful actually to be there and to be able to you know end one huge chapter of my life and begin another one literally two days later but also everybody was there like the majority of the cast was there peter burg came down it was just like we all got to say goodby in this huge way whic
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00001.flac	um comes from a military background you know her fathers fathers
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00002.flac	before i did this movie u i thought i had stamena but no um i trained for about a month before i even got to new orleans with my trainer
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00003.flac	uh once we got there we did about a month and a half of non stop training about eight hours a day which included
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00004.flac	um uh hando hand combat training stunt training coreography unute training were i work tis
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00005.flac	wepon's training and then actual physical training to stay strong um and each of us
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00006.flac	n was an awesome experience you like you never know what's gonna happen when you you know
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00007.flac	it it's a it's funny how immediately they'e become your brothers i mean you're out in the middle of nowhere hours a day you hear things you smell things
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00008.flac	you know way too much so we became close
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00009.flac	s the entire movie and has you know her hair in a poney taile or she's wearing boy clothes so by the time i got to the red dreass i was kind of excited to weare
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00010.flac	i love that guy so much he's one of the funniest people on the planet and you know we had about a week of learning the coreography for that so we had a blast i steptd on
id10014_s4Go6oBiQ8Y_00011.flac	firstone that's okay the second one sets itself up and also if you're not a gijo fan you're also gonna love this movie it's an awesome action pat
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00001.flac	i can see in les ther hiding somewhere we i mean uh no i get recognized a little bit but not a whole lot of
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00002.flac	extensions and stuff so it's a bit uh i look a bit different but um i gent a
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00003.flac	a mystery to me i'm not a big horor fan but only because i haven't seen a lot of them i think as soon as i get into it i love it i mean i love i've i enjoyed nearly all the movies that ie watched in researching for the for the role and all the books i um all the books i read but
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00004.flac	things that make a vampire what they are but there's also other things and more important
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00005.flac	i may have suggested that i wear the more cause i was cold on set it was so cold shooting the show i mean it was freasing all the time so any extra layor we could get i'd always take so
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00006.flac	esin cold in bristal n thi's winter um bt yeah i'm great surprised i don't know how
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00007.flac	being a werewolf that i just suck really wouldn't itmea that you don't gain you don't benefite at all really from that guess i' be a
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00008.flac	be a vampire aguest them when i i'd be a vampire cause i just bcause i can't be the other two
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00009.flac	i'm thinking i don't wan a live forever but i love to live for like five hundred years and then just i tot myself
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00010.flac	you know i need to be a more honest person  i didn't i didn'tti no i didn't get any of that um but yeah  as an actor i learned tones
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00011.flac	when the first jobs i've done te one of the biggest jobs i've done um so to work with the the caliber of actors that i workedwth
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00012.flac	but yeah f as an actor i learned tons i me i mean i learned so much this is one of the one f the first jobs i've done and one of the biggest jobs i've done um so to work with the the caliber of actors that i worked with
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00013.flac	i think i'd be excited by anything i'd love to make anything work and because now i have such a better sense
id10016_SCFgvk0Sm24_00014.flac	where he's come from and all those kinda things and just a better sense of thim as a character i think i'd love to try anything out
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00001.flac	you know he he's he realizes that this is all it's all too much there's people getting hert the
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00002.flac	bein if he was to do that and completely cotizse en the story that's not that's not a bad resolution for michel i don't think now at least he knows he can't hurt anybody else or at least he's not responsible souly responsible for the legasy of these other people that are all blody inocent you know so it's a hard thing to have soh when he shows up at the house after killing harry
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00003.flac	he he needs to be stopped and killed and and the only way really is to is to let his best mate do it i don't think it was ever the writer's intention in this show to kinda make characters that are likeable as such anyway i think it's hard to to write that down i think it's you just kinda have to feel it ind play it and i i
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00004.flac	nocking around for centuries so he's not done wit living yet on like michiel in in a lot of ways so
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00005.flac	i can't believe it's all over now i can't believe this is the end after everything this is the end
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00006.flac	uh so that's what michiel does and he makes the bravest decision that he'
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00007.flac	certainly made in the entire series i mean probably in in in all three of them you know it's it's a proper decision of bold decision and
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00008.flac	some of them they get through and then some of them they don't and i think it's it's a realistic sort of balance on that um and how they deal with
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00009.flac	i think it's managed to do that something i'm quite proud of about this show i think they've managed
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00010.flac	you know he's managed to get several lives i good or bader and different i don't think it matters i think he's managed to squeese a lot of living in
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00011.flac	for other people i think it's the consequences what he fears he fears ruining life for other people but it's that mentality i think a lot of those vampires would have i don't think they fear death that way
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00012.flac	uhits it's a funny thing finishing jobs you know you think the emotion will be in the scene and and hopefully bits of it will be but sometimes that can that can sort of change things not always in a good way you kinda need to
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00013.flac	uh hate saying thisbut in character um and not to be you cause yheu can be very that can be very self indulgent you know just to to let your own emotions consume what's going on here idon't think it's a it's not about me it's it's about mitchel um so i think to serve him right
id10016_bIi7FnNx6m0_00014.flac	u i kind of you need to kinda know where your heads out and stuff i think i think at the party i think when we have a couple o drinks afterwards and stuff that wiull be um known that here's a lot of people i won't
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00001.flac	i'm pretty excited yeah it's nice to do prasan to kind of revisit the memories of the show um it's nice to be out her doing it too hand the first series went down pretty good
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00002.flac	wellrested i know i know well it it's yeah a cliff hanger you know  pun intended we're we're right at theside of the clif wand it all happens um that's where we we that's where we continue right in realh time from that moment um it's pretty rough for us i mean it's his
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00003.flac	into liquidation they broke um the reationship wth with dimelza is kind of at it's worst they lost julia um their their daughter it
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00004.flac	the the only way is up and then you know he gets whell he's potentially charged with with inciting a riat and and murder which is a death sentence at that time so it's it's pretty grim for for the
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00005.flac	well i think george always wanted to be in the gang you know george is is the son of a of a ilegitimate um uh black
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00006.flac	you know he he always wanted more um and i gues ross had it you know ross kinda seemlously sort a slips between the the aristocrasy and andand the working class and that's something that george just can never get you know george wants to be he wants to be ross you know hewants to be the eadere leader of the gang and and hit'snot really happening why ross won let him in i guess he just doesn't have respect for m you know all he wants
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00007.flac	yeah yeah he he really wants to bring ross down i mean he's he's absolutely commited to doing that um and he' he starts by doing a a decent job i mean this he sends fliers around a
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00008.flac	yeah um well that's drama isn't it i mean i i i i suppose i don't know
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00009.flac	e's a lot of fun to play i mean he feels like a a real person to me i mean he's flored that's wat like he's not just this
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00010.flac	juststepping in as this iconic kind of um person legandary figure um on a horse you know riding into town and saving everyone's life and being the robin hood character to everybody and he's not he's
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00011.flac	's um he's a real guy for me you know he's he's heavily flowed he he makes mistakes
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00012.flac	he's he's very proud um he's not great a delegation i know he's he's what we probably calle a control freeak you know these days you now he wants to do everything himself he wants the waight of the world he doesn't want to he doesn't never want domellze to worry about anything um he's uh
id10016_ywRolvE7ToY_00013.flac	but he's the people's hero too you know i mean by default he he wants to help people you know that's that's where he lie an think he's got a big heart um and he realizes he needs to stick around to to reestablish the mining industry to give people jobs to to help people i mean that's um and he's a good drinker too he enjoyes
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00001.flac	in america they're angry at in general i think they're angry at inflation and they're angry at
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00002.flac	at un and not beingu able to influence their own lives
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00003.flac	i i i don't undersand why they still call them stu students they've had the hostages for ninety days don't you get don't you get expelled if you're out of school for ninety
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00004.flac	time and um and people are very angry so they take out their anger and then they they they use um sexual explatives to express their anger thaet's that funny thing where uh people express their anger sexually and it makes you wonder if they express their sex angrilyn i wouldn't want to actually
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00005.flac	uh one of the strong reasons i wouldn't is that i wouldn't um send people off to war and that kinda has a basic requirement on being president that you're willing to do that
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00006.flac	reading a next question into it about because the the the thing that's coming up now is should they dralft women
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00007.flac	well if they draft anybody i think they aht to draft everybody i think that u i don't i i don't understand the thinking that feels that women are so inferior that they can't
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00008.flac	in the whatever meaningful action is taken i i think if uh if something important and vital
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00009.flac	with me what they would do about it and how they would react to it and for the first time in their lives
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00010.flac	they were talking to me about something that conserned them as people the cource of history
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00011.flac	uh and it's a horrible way to to go about it and uh it's it's uh it's an it's a
id10020_HELG9IIqhBE_00012.flac	did includ them as as principles in the action uh i don't think we should uh excluod women as principles
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00001.flac	to get gene to uh agree to let me work on to let me do i i i had an i this idea for this story about the sickiatrist becoming depressed and and writing a to get out of his depression he writes a secret letter to sigmand froyd and
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00002.flac	uh i mean in his imagination borit is of course dead buy his time
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00003.flac	uh gene said now this is a mistake don't do this because if you if you ask an actor to play depresed it'll be depressing for the audience
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00004.flac	i took that to heart and i and i went even more for what i
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00005.flac	had a sense i could do but i but it really confermed this for me and and made me go more in this direction which was that the guy is fighting his depression and on the surphice seems
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00006.flac	the lid on it and and his kindo hold it trying to hold it down and that uh that helped make that work but it ist it is a dangero if you if you have if you ask an actor to to play somebody depressed theur firist tendancy is to get morose
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00007.flac	uh i just i just loved his work and i and i wanted to write for him i was so convinsed that he really was a siciatrist i used to sit and talk with him between scenes as if he was a seciatrist and after a couple of months of that i knoticed he was giving me these strange looks
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00008.flac	me and i would talk to him as if he w i knew he was an actor i knew he wasn't a scykiatres but he just seemed so so real in the
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00009.flac	you know both of these shows i that you're askng me about here i i i wrote and directed
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00010.flac	i had a lot of fancy writing in inga i had tha i had it opened with a a
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00011.flac	uh a a halkguy you know to set him to set him up as this womanizing guy that that inga takes down a notch
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00012.flac	i i loved that writing so i it made it made me made me very
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00013.flac	a a hand spring on the way to the stage to pick up my ammingi because i was so i was so really really happy to
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00014.flac	you get an award for acting and you don't really know how much of it his
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00015.flac	putor or because you're on a popular show but if you get an award for writing the chances are much
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00016.flac	the interesting i talked about how i thought i did a good job writing especially a that that monalogu and the
id10020_RSevwDj13_g_00017.flac	tha i was able to come up with but the funny thing is about writing is that the stuff that comes out the best i think is stuff that you feel you just happen to be
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00001.flac	i was making a movie in the uta state prison when they sent me the script and
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00002.flac	i wht i i i i had to wait until i was finished with the prison job uh before i could say yess to it
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00003.flac	that the war wouldn't just be a jovial background to high jinks i i didn't wanna do high jinks at the front
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00004.flac	um recent example of a wartime comedy was u mihail's
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00005.flac	the kind of thing we wanted to avoid i mean everybody was amiable on that program and it was amusing but
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00006.flac	the job they had i mean it might have been the news room on the mary tyler moore
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00007.flac	and and the people who come back from wars tell you that and  all the research we did certainly conferm that
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00008.flac	painted war as a nutral or even amusing
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00009.flac	and i didn't know how they felt about that and then sat something you can talk aboutit on the phone easily so they had to wait until i
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00010.flac	happened to be the night before they were gonna begin rehearsing that a about ten days rehearsal and then we we're gonna shoot the pilot um so we sat up in a coffe shop and a
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00011.flac	the night before we rehearsed and we talked till about two in the morning and they were in complet agreement with me i just but i needed to be reasured
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00012.flac	the way we did the show but the fact that we did the show that
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00013.flac	difference between that show and just about any other comedy that had ever been on up until then because we
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00014.flac	very funny comedy we had all kinds of comedy comedy birlesk satire
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00015.flac	and we didn't drop either of those and that gave us a combination that was s
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00016.flac	it gave them a chance to appreciate the show the way you appreciate
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00017.flac	life is not a series of guiggles the way most half hour
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00018.flac	it was by the way in my mind not about the vetno
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00019.flac	reference well there were yeah i understood that there were connections because it was
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00020.flac	i didn't think we were trying to convince people any of anything about the vetnam war i think lary gelbart
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00021.flac	but it's really about now it was to say a hundred years ago was irony i think
id10020_jPGRVcnoOWY_00022.flac	except then i thought that that war appled what we had to say about that war appliyed to all
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00001.flac	sort of unexpected family and it and it and it goes really well weare really a great family litle boy blossomes we are in love and everything's great and then
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00002.flac	absolutely i think in a funny sort of way because it's a period piece you can start to stand back from it and and look at it but in so doing you realize that there's that not much has changed there's been great strides and some iias
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00003.flac	bigutry and pregudis and homopobia have not ebed i've not disappeared so it's it's it's really i think that was actually one of th mame reasons why w did want to do it because i thouht i did have a lot to say about it's good to remember that great things have happened and but we mustn't be complacent i men mustn't like you know be grateful for getting a rights we should we should they're rights not privileges and we should demand
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00004.flac	you know the one of the best things about doing this film is meeting him and havg spending that tyme with him and and u
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00005.flac	suf wen he came out in america getting to see in all these other events there's been and keeping in touch ith them we sent a little
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00006.flac	emotionsthat are on the surfhise when he's happy he jumps up and down with joy when he's
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00007.flac	inconsolably he's a big he's a big trier uh when we wet when the film opened in new york
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00008.flac	the the the premiar he heu re up on stage and he just hou started weeping cause he was so happy and all the
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00009.flac	it's correct i'm not in that um i dont i mean i' i they haven't actually ever
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00010.flac	i it was nearly going to be i wasupsed tob in the third one i was under a contract and then tha didn't happen and an they sort of
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00011.flac	kind of slight chat about this one but i think i i don't know i i wasn't and i don't know i i wold it's one of these things i eveon wis kind of a little obsessed byi
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00012.flac	un uh but right no that's not gonna happen but actually the week after this film comes out his comes out in stember the sixt and thi september the
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00013.flac	this film called sor billy the vet th  an animated film a a scotish animated film i did with uh shon connery uh he plays billy the vet and i play his got
id10021_QwS8VUaQwZM_00014.flac	and uh then i'm i go back to moo uh to new york cause i'm  in the middle of a
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00001.flac	stil coming on but the other thing about being the host of it that's weird is that you know when your host as show normally like if you host some film ar ward you don't have to like make a filmu like when you're thehot of the twentes youactuly have to be in these musical
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00002.flac	we're doing tha like tribdut thing to him and it's sort of like being in a weird kind of vertual reality dream for me because we're dancing
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00003.flac	singing in a sort of a a mashup of three very famous shows that tommy tune's done none of which i know and none of which i really understand
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00004.flac	i went um you know little dad and chris who's doing headdik right i went with him tos a place down in in the west virist called maris crices as a piano bars i oot and we went there and and they said oh alon and daran you know would you sing a song and why do we sing and they said allan why dodt you sing one of your songs from cabry and this wis you know a couple years ago and i was like okay and i'd had a few drinks and i in the middle of the song i forgot the
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00005.flac	wyeh a she was like she had written like omfg on it ime  s like that and en and then she was like and hen after about a minut she kindaf started twisping tilon  ti te ba and then after about two minutes she was talking abou nd then a ter was like
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00006.flac	broadway uh show business the road to broadway and it was about a season in broadway and four different musicals one of which was wicked so during the course of the te u of for it was id i was seeing lots of fhootage of it and  chryston i was
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00007.flac	like that es and so it became in our household like if you wanted to anoy on each ither of us we would like to sing pup you let you goy sh
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00008.flac	and so when we were when the premeer of the film was on i was on the red carpet you know i and that wird thing when a friend of yours comes on the red carpet you'r lke hih and you're like t
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00009.flac	so that was christon came on and i went pop dulerd i'm a  uand she went shut up i he
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00010.flac	and then grant my husband was sitting over there and and and i i said oh my god
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00011.flac	i went oh my god you see that tall balldy guy over there if you go over and sing popular to him it will be hellatos cause he hates
id10021_ifrR3O4CBW0_00012.flac	having a drink and  and and he said after egos this girl came over and and i and i thought she's like the wicked girl and all of a sudden you know she's tyny
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00001.flac	andthe asked me to i  hosted things around the world and i sing that means that's short hand for
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00002.flac	organization you know and and i went to china actually i went i did tha sponcerd walk for
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00003.flac	and and when you arrived at the whatever you're gonna you know  come off the wall to camp for the night your tent would hav
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00004.flac	because i think um especially in places late chaina where theyre no dealing with id's epidemic and it in uu you know and and i saw t not prepared or weren't prepared for it um and i just feel like i've always felt like that uh adsh still has such a stigma of
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00005.flac	sort of idea that gay people were in some way you know invented it
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00006.flac	few good things that maggy thacher did uh was she did this campagn uh well she didn't but she
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00008.flac	tofind myself really as bysexual but i don't mind i don't care what you call i mean i i think it's really
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00009.flac	remember just before i got that actall though i reallyneded to play more grownup people you know people who just aren't
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00011.flac	i i uh it was i think everyone knew it was kind af gong ta bethis last films
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00012.flac	u but it just took so long for it to happen it shot for a year and a
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00013.flac	tom cruse and stanly cureck and i'd met tom before he was very nice and i went
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00014.flac	u uh thi's not  this is not king leer i'm playing hou i just wast and it was just too arly and i just thought i mean
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00015.flac	i feel i'm nearly fifty and it's kind of when you say that you think creaky what
id10021_rMhAG-q3Y3s_00016.flac	i i i like being older because of the wit and the expedients and things that you you gan and you have and and yeah i love the fact that you know i i still seem to have the energy
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00001.flac	uh as i have two shows coming up today which seems at the moment like a kind of improsses
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00002.flac	was a what we call primary school sertan what you call that um element just seven years i
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00003.flac	well i think i was quite i'd already trained as a grafhic designer i'd already
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00004.flac	uh and in and in fact once i'd decided that now was the time ad it was always too early for me
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00005.flac	in about being an actor although i probably always knew that's what i
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00006.flac	what do you do you write letters to repatory companes and they all say well we've only got two  equity cards a year to give
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00007.flac	um we've only goten two eicrity cads yer to give and you must
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00008.flac	a like a lot of things a lot of activities you got this piece of your equipment called your
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00009.flac	and that takes forever to so to anser your question it's not
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00010.flac	you know as i was just saying to you what i hear is not what you hear so i don't even know what you're talking
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00011.flac	alot of it's just to do with the architecture of your mouth the sound
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00012.flac	you know there's a there's a rud definition of acting i forget which of which of the english actors was that
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00013.flac	and as luck would have it or one of those journing up the dock moments was i did a play by dusty hewes called
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00014.flac	that eventually led me to doing an afraben play called the lucky chance o the rok
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00015.flac	an donsees back at stratford but this time back at stratford i kinda knew what i was
id10022_S_Mr5l8yRiU_00016.flac	theater and we go over the road to a bar or a restaurant and the's a bunch of actors who we're all
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00001.flac	and producers ram your arm up behind your back and and say listen if you'd play this part we
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00002.flac	um it's not even as if you have the opportunity to to consider what the challenges are the only thing that made it in any way duable for me was
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00003.flac	uand in many ways actually the challenge is on film a less because you've got so much more of a support system you're surrounded by people who know what theyr
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00004.flac	thats set in sixteen eighty two in france and you're shooting it in englandw
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00005.flac	never more than twenty five miles from a motorway or if the wind changes you've got a flightpath coming over your head so suddenly the word cut is happening
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00006.flac	if you kind of threw a lasur around them you'd come ut with human
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00007.flac	period nature of it was it wasn't an i relevance cause of course it's a
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00008.flac	when you or members of the audience watch it i kind of hope that you'rel all
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00009.flac	mearly decorative objects they hade no function so kate winslet's character in the film
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00010.flac	you know you still have women as decarative objects all over the
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00011.flac	change and everybody sits at home with their huge screen and their five seats and theyr surround sound
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00012.flac	sit together with a a huge bunch of other people an an ana kind of once apon a time
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00013.flac	micha crosam of what i've just talked about because cause on the film set you may have a scene between two people but this
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00014.flac	twoor forty people with clip boards all around it everybody kind of knows um
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00015.flac	and in uh it it's what i was saying about kat before and and matius too youe you' you you got two characters who have to learn who they are on screen so therefore all the takes of the
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00016.flac	yeah you thought you knew what this film was about or what i'm about i the movie ituh was about but i
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00017.flac	that was very mesurably a time when we knew things were difficult
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00018.flac	no families nit together so u bit like a film crew came into operation ants and
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00019.flac	in u yo know amazing that it sticks in your mind the title role in a play called king grisly
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00020.flac	goes back to what i was saying about that silence you're involved in a story and then there's a lode of people in front of you and they'e gone
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00021.flac	tbut it it was uha fantastic school andt remains a fantastic school because it doesn't turm limite to you it's now coeducational in fact when i went there it was all boys uh
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00022.flac	very involved in the art department and so and because it was a very high achieving achademic school the idea of going to drama schrool
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00023.flac	lisor go to art school and i went to art school but still
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00024.flac	whatever piece of my brain is missing i don't know it's never ever thought that way um about
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00025.flac	tmy head no i i  all i really remember from that time is
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00026.flac	tu if there's something difficult to batten up or something it's gotta be fastened behind in the dressing room
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00027.flac	and then if theye got changes down to the wings wer the quick change costume and they're
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00028.flac	when i was asked to play it cause you have to remember that only three books havd been written when we started filming
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00029.flac	put through to her on the phone she was with her sister at the time and she'
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00030.flac	think it is it is possible clearly to manipulate people into an emotional
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00031.flac	this that are gonna faile you know that it's possible to try things that aren't going to be necessarily attractive i mean i'm not sure
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00032.flac	and i do believe i as an actor am part of a
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00033.flac	like most actors i don't enjoy watching myself cause all you see is what you
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00034.flac	and you know one has so many examples of people like
id10022_ZXYlWu1JfKU_00035.flac	uh or how much preparation you've done but somehow it all arives
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00001.flac	yeh pretty well i mean he may you myt say he's just an average man
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00002.flac	absolutely liberating y it's uh well i mean you know sometimes acting can be a great sort of playground and uh and this certainly was that
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00003.flac	that's pretty tough you know first thing in te morning good morning my name's allan what's your name oh fine wouldn you like to bend over this desk
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00004.flac	nicker elastic slete snappd or anything like that you know we were pretty
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00005.flac	um i think it all becomes part of the job like this you know
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00006.flac	you k get up at happast five in the morning and come and star at a smiliy
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00007.flac	uh about a piece of work you've done is one part of the job and another part of the job i think which of course is
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00008.flac	is um awards um i think but i think any sensible actor knows that parts win prises rather than the
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00009.flac	again it's part of the industry i believe in the film industry and i believe in telling stories i think it's all incredibly important we have to do it for the human race to survive and and awards our part of promoting that so um it's always interesting to see where those
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00010.flac	well yeah because you can do it in your pajamas rather than a boti and uncomfortable
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00011.flac	i don't know i mean i've got i've got some pieces of mettle at home with my name stamped
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00012.flac	um but you know what it when you think about uh movies and jobs you've done really the immage you have is of the people you worked with and wherye you were in the world you know
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00013.flac	well i mean i started doing some work with at with tim burtan and i said to him so do you want funny voices and he said no and so uh i'm at the beginning stage of it where because it's a mixture of live action animation stop mation i'm in that animation part of it so we've recorded me and now they're gonna go away and draw it and en i'll come back and revoice it many months down
id10022_qbHM0g5zCOY_00014.flac	he's pretty um motionless but you know who knows i'm not quite sure what they've got him
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00001.flac	more emis than any other quis or game show on television and yet therei seems to be more excitement about the
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00002.flac	dtend to do better than others doctors lawyor not
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00003.flac	gournalists also we discovered that of course in our power players tournament in
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00004.flac	indevice and i tell them don't worry as soon as you come up with a corect response you gain in confidence if you get the next
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00005.flac	eawent buy and unfortunately for me my two children discovered some of my old
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00006.flac	grades kept going down i i was just too tired i was working to
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00007.flac	been in broadcasting for fifty years hosted jepordy for twenty eight years a reporter asked me have you ever thought about
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00008.flac	debates that i have seen that are hosted by people in the news reporters comentators is that it's all so
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00009.flac	to come in and say hey you know what's your vision for america
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00010.flac	do we really want in this country is this a capitalist society well i don't think
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00011.flac	and i would hope that somebody they'd get the man off the street and some of the debates in the republican
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00012.flac	sjepordy all uh all kinds of people because americans are very
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00013.flac	and they can play in the safety of their homes  there's no dangere for you if you
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00014.flac	yeah you'll learn a lot of trivia and that won't do you any good in life but you will i hope be
id10029_152c1sTeQ48_00015.flac	uh during the commercial break about the new film about earnest hemming wi i didn't know that he was involved
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00001.flac	on his last appearance uh doing a
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00002.flac	we've never had any contestants who are were as ornery as mean and as troublesome as the shown
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00003.flac	i've been asked h whetheruh how i would feel if we had uh shon conry as a contestant on celebrity jepordy and uh because i'm such an easy going guy i tell everyone that i just walk up
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00004.flac	it's something i can regrow any time i want it's an easy thing to do you don't need a great deal of talent to grow a
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00005.flac	and that yet people still talk about and it made the news of course when it
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00006.flac	newsday there wasn't any war going on and uh a lot of the tabloids gota hold of that bit of information and were playing it up and so people noticed my
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00007.flac	but it's a difficult one because keep in mind that our first president served almost two and a half centuries ago and so the amount of information that george washington had is a lot different than the amount of information that barroco bma has but all other things being equal i would think perhaps woodro willson might have been a good
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00008.flac	uh jimmy carter was known as one of the smartest presidents when he took
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00009.flac	as well so i would pick those three as uh legitimate
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00010.flac	no i don't want to uh venture a response on that some of them uh were more recent than
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00011.flac	became our champion not too long after we
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00012.flac	got rid of the rul that said you had to leave the show after five wins and he wound up winning seven
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00013.flac	ken jennings was really the perfect storm of contestant game material and savy in terms of
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00014.flac	had a good sense of humor he was bright certainly he knew how to play the game knew how to emphasize certain points at
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00015.flac	on a double jepordy or a final jepordy clu and uh i think ken was one of he kind and i'm not sure we're gonna see that kind of success ever again on jepordy he was with us for four and a half months my gosh i was spending more time with ken jgennings
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00016.flac	for our ultimate turnament of champions in the final match which was a two game total point
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00017.flac	i i overheard uh our three contestants talking before the show and uh saying you know what we should do to throw alix off his game we should
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00018.flac	and they didn't do that of course and i thought that was kinda silly because they're behind their lectors
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00019.flac	my trousers of and i walked out without pants and that really blew them
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00020.flac	when i come out i'm out in the open somebody wrote in and said you have good legs so that was
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00021.flac	all the time i have what i call senior moments uh i have a story that i tell also when i began on jepordy i was much younger of course i was in my fourties and i never made mistakes then after a few years i would catch myself just as i was about to mis speak and
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00022.flac	myself just after i made a mistake now i'm at an age where i don't even know when i make a mistake i have to be told by
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00023.flac	we have to uh ask you to reread that clue why because you said seventeen forty three instead of fourteen seventy three oh i
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00024.flac	sit down as the host and that's something i have had the opportunity to do only once in my television hosting
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00025.flac	my age it's nice to sit down and the great thing about hosting hollywood squars is you ask a question of a celebrity and the celebrity gives a funny response
id10029_dhy9amxTK4M_00026.flac	and i can't think of a much better job than that one unless it's the one i
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00001.flac	h sugjestiond i said  dyo yu know there been a lot of different actors who portrayd why
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00002.flac	uh in adition to the wytrp television series and keven cosner
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00003.flac	so they wrote a catagory on wier and it played well and they did catagories called you know alex's favorite film
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00004.flac	ui don't have uh such a big  ego that if they don't accept them i'm gonna get my knose out of joint if you accept them fine if you don't
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00005.flac	and in the studio when we are talking about a response and whether we should accept it or whether our ruling was correct i express my opinion sometimes forcefully but if they don't accept my opinion i'm not gonna go in a corner and sulk hey i'm past that
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00006.flac	who does better as a contestant who performs the best and i said o
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00007.flac	nyour arias of interest and expertes if you know
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00008.flac	do well everybody thinks they know something about movies i said but you know don't be embarased if you don't know the corect response
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00009.flac	as i have with people is name the four defendents in judgement at
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00010.flac	now i happen to know that and i've known that for a long time i don't know why those names have stuck with me but i happen to knowta
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00011.flac	and nobody else does nobody else cares which is fin but if that came up on a show and you didn't
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00012.flac	so what don't feel bad about it amill han urnst yanning freter hofshtetter and verner lampy just in case
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00013.flac	some catagories that have failed yes and some that have succeeded
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00014.flac	depends on the three contestants who were on the show that day you have a catagory that you think is dinamighte dino might jimmy walker
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00015.flac	well those three players didn't do well with it somebody else could have done could have mopped the floor with his apponents uh in that catagory so you never know and we try the writers god bless them are really sharp
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00016.flac	uh i'm happy to see theye wone so memy so many mmis because of their writing they can take a mondain fact and
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00017.flac	make it light we're gonna do a catagory this year that we were i thought we were gonna do last year
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00018.flac	they gave me the games and i went over the games and one of the catagories was when the astecs spoke
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00019.flac	and the catagory was filled with clus that had all of these asteck words and welsh words it was a tong twisters
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00020.flac	and the game was going to air april first april fhool's day so it was just an april fhool's joke but i mentioned to a studio audience i was talking about this the other day and i
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00021.flac	after putting in i was really ticked at them because i put in a lot of minutes working on all those words and getting the the right uh diocritical marks so that i'd give it the correct
id10029_qpfQBQQ1FMs_00022.flac	and uh but it was just a joke for them so i said let's do it this year it'll be kind of fun and i said if i screw it up then i'll come after you with baseball bats and uh break your nees
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00001.flac	a sense of reality you never wanna fake it you never want to be outside of the person you're portraying
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00002.flac	so if you're telling somebody's story which is what you do when you imbody a
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00003.flac	their reality so uh i you know that's that's my gig that's
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00004.flac	but within that interpretation i can bend those thatill make you hear
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00005.flac	and so i was delighted that somebody saw me in a different way
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00006.flac	so uh and then i knew it was the people from the condring and with that pedegrey i thought well that's the that's the way to do it is to hop in
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00007.flac	andety is a great cintematographer and i knew um telling a story
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00008.flac	to create movement but not the kind of obvious you know i
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00009.flac	i i think the the best ones is when your moode is affected and you didn't see when it was happening and so i knew he would be able to bring that as an aded tool to drawing everybody into what seems like a story that they could be telling a reality from their own lives and their next on neaghbor's lives and before you know it they're off in it
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00010.flac	oh i have i have you know everybody thinks theyi'r travales ar
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00011.flac	but um so that's all sobjective but i have found pece because that's all we're all ever looking for and the things that we do yu once we stop corrazing ind
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00012.flac	still war off and i'm still feeling that we start to look for ways to uh
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00013.flac	i yeah i i i think it's there in our lives that's why we
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00014.flac	but i've also not had a lot of experiences how i'd react i don't know i think i'm
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00015.flac	that um i i i would see
id10035_KHVJaN5lrq4_00016.flac	as a subjective state and then that means i've
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00001.flac	um so we watch the work that they do to make sure that uh the american homelands
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00002.flac	ge uh but they also have a personal relationship uh that is very complex
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00003.flac	is that daily briefing book that the president gets every day this is the truth has the top ten most pressing security
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00004.flac	an homeland and so the amolis we never hear about them we started to talk and see things about the oporatives but the amelists are the ones that have to sit and
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00005.flac	from around the world constantly chatter could be inenet chatter it could be anything that somebody saw or porceved you know that
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00006.flac	a lot they're getting a lot of input over it langly constantly uh has to cia headquarters and so the analist job is to is to
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00007.flac	se's um she's come from the military she was a person that saw combat during desert storm doing the first one the first gulf war uh so she's experienced and we find it very interesting we have not had a military president since
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00008.flac	to explore and so constance has she's out of california
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00009.flac	follow protocall and find out who's responsible for this attack and bring them to justice but as
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00010.flac	anything will be solved every week the episodes stand on their
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00011.flac	the the characters will keep unfolding as we go on and the storylines
id10035_leDQcByu2GU_00012.flac	wlunfhold and the complication of other parts of it will become even more
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00001.flac	well um i came to anabell which is u
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00002.flac	thriller i came to it because i was invited no one's ever asked
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00003.flac	to that jona before um and i i'm
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00004.flac	to do the same thing a lot but even in doing that i try to always
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00005.flac	um so we meet our beautiful couple
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00006.flac	and they live i think on the west side of los angeles and they have neabors that they have
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00007.flac	awful occurance next door that slams right into the lives of
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00008.flac	people always say based on a true story but whatever has come out of a
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00009.flac	all kinds of images and thoughts and people that have flash flash flash so
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00010.flac	this type of story and anabel i it would depend so much on the sensibilities and the ey of a of a really great ciematographer
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00011.flac	allof that isn't that head of yours this is just crazy than i would ask
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00012.flac	allof that isn't that head of yours this is just crazy then i would ask my
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00013.flac	pirits and people in gamsers and everybody just wacking it out and theyre and with
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00014.flac	she really every time they would give me the i'd have to hold and it was like oh my god this's like a big old four year old how
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00015.flac	you know the way you know she's kinda put together but i also felt
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00016.flac	i don't know i just felt badly for anabel people were creeped out by her but
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00017.flac	it's all love so i have not um i i've had no
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00018.flac	but all of our lives is subjective ir
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00019.flac	that's that's the reality um and we can tell their stories as well and we all like to hear each other's stories
id10035_peVZqDhzQhc_00020.flac	oi think one of the things that we're attracted to when we start to talk about the pera normal is that we get bored with what we can see in
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00001.flac	they were very welcoming um apart from when they pushed me over and all stood on me
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00002.flac	i'm joking they w're incredibly welcoming i i push myself over the first day around on the enterprise they keep this floures very
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00003.flac	and um i had a little wedge built into my boot and i uh came bounding on the enterprise with all the energy jj wants you to have and i just went
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00004.flac	he was he was yeah i guess that gave me ten percent trek  he was a fan of it he liked shatner i grew to really like shatner actually and now um i love shatner
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00005.flac	i watched the eighty two movie which yeah bbe besh plays carral markas i i loved
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00006.flac	it's exactly what you're saying  he he brings familis together everywhere you know he has a a strong family of his own um he has amazing kids amazing wife um he then goes on to set and makes uss a family he makes uss a family by starting every day with a big loud joke that he will like boom out sometimes he'll have everybody like just break into applause which being english i found really weird i was like hat are we clapping at
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00007.flac	nothing i was like oh naturally well just applaued at nothing but he would and you know that's kind of a a a very like tribal primal way of uniting everyone and he just has a the ability to uniht he's a he's a leader i guess in a war he'd be the uh
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00008.flac	yeah you know it's definitely complicated um making sure that you preserve the integrity of the film and give people something to be surprised by but at the same time you just
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00009.flac	ah i was doing a play when i was twelve uh called twelvf night ui played olivia and um i was in the middle of my like speech and i forgot where i was and i finished it and like i came back and realized where i was and then i thought that if it has the powers of like transportation if it you can beam you out of your moment and back again then it's probably
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00010.flac	itwas a very different experience to working with jaj it was three of us it was stanly toche neel and myself it was a very intimate experience
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00011.flac	ewas was an an intense and wonderful time actually he's a great mind and um the characters he he develops at intricate and multy layed so some velvat morning is a movie i'm very proud of and stanliy tooche and i had a great tie
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00012.flac	uh lodes of things you know id then  went on to do a movie called coled comes the night with briyan cranston both of those men are such dignified a gentleman um and stanly is very funny um i don't know i i i haven't i didn't realize how funny he was until i worked with him and brian is very serious detailed approach to his work so i learnt lightness of touch from stanly every time we were like get
id10036_EAsTZq6lLHI_00013.flac	me and brian's a detaile focused guy which is why he was able to play a chemistry teacher on breaking
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00001.flac	heye are an amazing group of people that he's assembled and everyone has
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00002.flac	talent and depth of personality and generous spirit and
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00003.flac	and also a great privilege to be around so to have met everyone on this
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00004.flac	father who's no longer with us was a huge star treck fan of the
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00005.flac	ss in the sixties which is what i went back and watched in preparation because it was the sort of advent and um
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00006.flac	and so yeah so in honor of my grandfather i is enough for me to be part of something that i know he was a fan of
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00007.flac	nity with sort of trees and bunnes but we would still feel and have spirites even if we were surounded by mettle as we are now so i think it would be an oversight to miss that but it's very difficult to capture and to track an emotional story but that's jjas
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00008.flac	that's the the the absolute motive is to find the the source of the
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00009.flac	and um the emotion and the journey of each character and then on that the information comes
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00010.flac	n that w sort of almost had a albetross around its neck and um so
id10036_NP3WmxUdvnI_00011.flac	super successful action film on all levels i mean not just successful in financial or hollywood terms but really successful in rewarding
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00001.flac	it was a got reaction cause it was actually um in we made it a couple of years ago as you may know and it was actually the best script i'd read that like i read it in like april something it was the best script i'd read that year
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00002.flac	wrong i don't really have a judgement on that actually but for right or wrong it still is and um i related to maybe if you don't want it to be how
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00003.flac	i think she doesn't want it to be and i think it makes her hard inside and i don't think she'll ever recover
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00004.flac	like i remember i was i was hungry and and i was um tired u on stage and i went and i had some
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00005.flac	pay the pricey  there's no there's no like magic to it it's exactly how you would imagine it being it's like oh my i'm naked roking
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00006.flac	about the whole thing and he he didn't like when we were off set he was like we could both
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00007.flac	he didn't wanna like chat and which  eventually i i grew to cherish because it meant that like you were just coming together as these characters and um that made the whole process
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00008.flac	he's just a great guy like jim is and you know that i think when you're um an actor in you'r twenties i think so much of it is about being a great guy because ou really are just like being who you are as an actor and you're twenties like him like in those these roles he playes if he was a
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00009.flac	he's got his gilfriend who he's been with for like four years and she was around and she was great
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00010.flac	right but we know he's got a great voice cause he did across the universe and he does yeah i know that's a whole other world it's not my world
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00011.flac	cause i was listening to george harrison and his voice was so like george
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00012.flac	it well wain wroate it as well and that makes for a specific combination i think when you have a writer director they're married to it in a way that um someone who like takes a script on
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00013.flac	and so it was very much about wain was very clear about what he wanted and it was very much about like getting that for him and um it was very personal for wain as well i
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00014.flac	you know because he he's he's south african so he's not american and so he had to have a struggle to gain statos as well and
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00015.flac	reincarnation of wane in some in some capascity i don't think exactly but i think so our relationship i think was quite personal for him and um so
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00016.flac	i mean yeah it's very it's it's an issue for everyone the imigration because imigration isn't just for the people who wanna go to the country that they wanna go to it's for the people who are in the country that are accepting the people into it and and then it's not just about people who wanna like live in a country but it's like so you have imigration let's say from mexico to california and then you have like tourism from california to mexico so the the
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00017.flac	think that it's difficult for both parties on both the reciving end the hosting end and the kind of
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00018.flac	um compassionate about it i think that's the key and i think when you read about the canadian or the british imigration policies they're very compassionate in their
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00019.flac	o um or the people who don't want people to emigraten i think that maybe um australia in america a little more heardline about it
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00020.flac	like i can't say that it's harder for me as an english actress to um to get anywhere just because i think american's are very generous towards us and i lie that's a wonderful thing for me it's just dam hard as an actress perri i just i think it's just hard because um there are a lot of you
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00021.flac	and um there aren't so many roles as there are for young men you know especially leading roles and um so i think it's just to struggle as as as an as an artist as an
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00022.flac	is cool and i guess you can only be that cool if you were a carpenter
id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00023.flac	cool men like i he just walks around he's easy you don't feel like he's a star you don't feel like he's um

id10036_x4d2Y7WcuHY_00025.flac	dn't feel like he is but briging the gap between those things for like an attraction and potentially
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00001.flac	because he was so he's such a an excentric man um i was always embarosed because he wasn't the guy that was watching sports with my friends dads he was he was like in his basement trying to like figure out how to fix one of his redls and put it in the projector and he was like up till three am everynight reading this

id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00009.flac	it was a lot but it was the the biggest challene of my career and i feel like i feel like i can finally say i'm i'm an actor
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00010.flac	yeah i mean she she had a real life a real story um a
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00011.flac	nd and i worked together the first three days of our shoot the first week um and i i was intimidated just playing the role finally like all the preparation and research i did and finally starting you know getting on set everything's ready for you and you just got ta go and do it and i was just terrified because she is a
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00012.flac	playing my mother she's a force u but i swere i knew she was in my corner immediately she's very mateurnal and she was
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00013.flac	she just said the right things and she got me there and i swere she literally slaped me into the
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00014.flac	see that that that the the their relationship is i mean she's got an intense family life and she's lahte just coming home from curfe la and she walks in the door and
id10041_5g4NwozVJpA_00015.flac	annothe role um but i am so grateful for that because there's no i like reality i as much as you can do it without like hurting somebody i don't mind being slapd because  it just really  was real
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00001.flac	um  you know i don't remember i think i kind of just oh god i uh
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00002.flac	ncredibly boring and i've had an amazing childhood and i grew up very close to manhattaon and um
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00003.flac	like for for for example she uh in the cowawa movies she made the gutars that they
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00004.flac	incredible movie um but but you have to uh you have to know how to sing
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00005.flac	for me um i used to be a singer i quit uh when i was seventeen biggest regret om my
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00006.flac	which makes it um you have to change your life style for for to you that dicipline is um its insane but you get to be in the moment as an actor it's like super indulgent and uh i had the best time ever but um and o also for the audience it it connects them to the characters and and
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00007.flac	d hidrates you you drown yourself in in water you always have to p
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00008.flac	you go home at night um and you you sit and wait till the next day because you don't wan to get sick
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00009.flac	there's so much going on in your in your vocal coards that um yeah you have to treat them like thei're
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00010.flac	big fan of whiskey and uh i'm i i uh i love middlton i had some middlton russel crow gave me some middleton for my birthday i had some of that before i got here and then um your lovely coliegus uh
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00011.flac	tng i've never done a live television show or uh uh after
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00012.flac	i i i i'm i'm super nervous when i'm on stage i have stage fit i've never done a broadway show or a show in general
id10041_HBF8LIr8RG4_00013.flac	heartfull of love which is one of the iconic numbers where i get to hit a really high knote and um and eddy redman and smathe barks are incredible uhcredible cost stars the best singers um they're singing
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00001.flac	i didn't really yeah it never seemed very holly to me at first it was just really really
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00002.flac	you i'me never i've never seen a a story like that before really i mean if
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00003.flac	the movie that it was based on but in i had never seen it nor i mean had i read the script so of of
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00004.flac	o it was so intriguing because first of all i never got the opportunity to play somebody that's so complex and so dark and
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00005.flac	andand uh and he knows the character so well so and at that point
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00006.flac	we knew our characters at that pointcause uh we had you know really there was a lot of
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00007.flac	uh when you're on set it's just the it's really h what count does really being able to
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00008.flac	make me feel like i really fit in and i belong there and that was like the that was like the best gift
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00009.flac	oh these scenes it was just like we were going at it as one is opposed to like
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00010.flac	not necessarily looking for love or looking to be loved but i think she hopes for it one day and she's really kind of just getting buy i mean she's she
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00011.flac	we she she got by you know she was able to make money because she found this kind of sexual power
id10041_WZnAngBVsmM_00012.flac	things that happen and and then i think that throws clowy off even more and and the obsession comes i mean naturally because
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00001.flac	thi leadership came from a place of empowering others and that was the entire movement was was going to these farmworkers men women and children who were were so uneducated so eliterate so unresoursed and saying you can be your own change
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00002.flac	you don't have to wait for someone else to come and make the change for you and he gave them a way to um to find their voice and to use their voice and i think that that is the
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00003.flac	dream that we live in a country where the power is in the people
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00004.flac	what i found so interesting about diago's vision for the film was to really humanise seaser and to not
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00005.flac	make him to to kind of do away with the iconic heroic
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00006.flac	the goal was to make him feel like a man like a mortal like you and iy so that so that the audience watching it could see themselves in his struggle that heroes aren't born heroes they
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00007.flac	and one way of achieving that was to depict him as a father and as a husband as he was and and also to show the sacrifices that his family and those around him were asked to make in order to create that
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00008.flac	nineteen years old and so they really grew up together they formed their views and opinions of the world together as a partnership and they both lived this reality both of them were
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00009.flac	since they were children hellen since she was seven years old she was working in the fieelds so
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00010.flac	um this caus was deeply engrained in their relationship
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00011.flac	think that that you know who can say what seaser would have accomplished  without hellen but um but i think that who he became and who helen became was deeply informed by their marriage and their
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00012.flac	lethinos watching this film would take so much pride and so much inspiration in what is possible in our communities you know
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00013.flac	in our communities and it's up to us to empower ourselves and for me that manifests itself
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00014.flac	and you know we are becoming the face of this country and for the issues that we care about to
id10044_FZj7urR6Q10_00015.flac	discustd and talked about in the halls of power and for us to be a part of that conversation we have to claime that political presence and to me that means registering to vote getting into the minds of our communities and to our youth that that change will only happen when we show up for ourselves and soh you know if i had to say there was you know one first step towards
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00001.flac	we took a trip we do get along but i just always feel like vigous is the wrong choice
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00002.flac	like i was terrified it's not fun to all of a sudden be in the iddle of a magic show and and on my cast lot i was in on it and um and i wasn't and
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00003.flac	like asked me all these questions about myself and then had me right down a celebritie's name and then
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00004.flac	um and then like this uh streatch um humvlymmo pulled upokay and we were just gonna get in cabs but then like you're drunk and there's a humbe lymmo and you're like that's
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00005.flac	and and they're like it's fine it's only tenjus you know ten bocxs ahead but then you take like a five minute ride and you pake two hundred
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00006.flac	but the the length of the ride was the length of hotline bling and we danced to that
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00007.flac	employes who work at a big box walmart like stor and the
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00008.flac	like stor and the chenannigans they get into and their relationships and it's
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00009.flac	people were tweating me like oh no america's doing wallmark
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00010.flac	like this one girl was like oh thank god it's a show i was super concerned
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00011.flac	touchd by the concern and i was like thank you for your concernd i'm fine but also like i'm pretty sure a wallmark dasnel like ad would
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00012.flac	rvest i'm all about it but the vest like whereever i am if i'm wearing that vest people ask me where things are like people think i work whereever i am
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00013.flac	ere coming in and out and they'd be like excuse me where is this i'm like i don't work here they're like sure
id10044_VbvQ_Iy8Wwk_00014.flac	and and then by the end it was like day six i'm like the toilet paper is an ile for like i i knew it was there
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00001.flac	very happily and then there's an outside conflict that involves people who don't believe in that way of life of vikings wriding dragons so that comes to sort of threattened hickups way of life and theories on vickings and dragons and lots of
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00002.flac	but uh uh hickup finds his long lost mother who's voiced by kate blanchet um and there's really there are aa couple other incredibly
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00003.flac	and kit harrington uh comes and stars and uh as a errit son of erad
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00004.flac	feel a romantic vibe in their relationship but
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00005.flac	um and hickup you know this is definitely a coming of age story for hickup and hickup is coming into his own as all all of the characters are and he is moving towards
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00006.flac	having to step into the role of chief and for astrad that that is a very natural
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00007.flac	hkon hol heartedly with no quams about it and hickup is more of a reluctant
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00008.flac	hero he doesn't know that that's right for him so that's his journey and and astrad is is u just a different person than hand they have kind of different beliefs but
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00009.flac	that that the that the whole audience no matter how young or old you are enjoys the experience i mean it's a beautiful experience one of my my favorite parts of the film are the the the writing sequences because they're just they just transport you to another place and
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00010.flac	you feel like you're there in the middle of it but the story is deep and and and quite touching and so hopefully you know those old enough to really go with that story will will really appreciate it and and
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00011.flac	ids will um have fun and i also think you know are never to be under estimated with how much they can
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00012.flac	and dean our writer director was not affraid to to to really let the story go where it had to go and trust that the audience um no matter how young yor old
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00013.flac	ly different this time around the first time no one knew what to expect and now there's this beloved audience that has high
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00014.flac	you know i have to say for myself i was a big fan of the first one and i was blown away with the second film so i think
id10044_a6iK1fR6Xm8_00015.flac	i'm just excited to see what comes out of dean's imagination i mean after the first film it was so satisfying it was hard to imagine where it was gonna
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00001.flac	it but it wasu yeah it was going to a wedding with my boyfriend at the time and i
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00002.flac	was in like my mid twenties and just was like i really hate this and um i can't do it like i can't be this social with this many people for this long
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00003.flac	and then but getting to a place where i didn't think something was wrong with me and that i thought it was okay and i actually kind of like i really like that i know that i need time on my own to
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00004.flac	for the baire minimum i can't do a weekend a full weekend
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00005.flac	i mean uu and you know my friends are still getting married i'm like we're thirty five can we stop like why are people still doing this um but
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00006.flac	um hopefully i have access to a room but i have done that i've like sat in a star buks bathroom and just sat on the floor and just taken a minut nobody
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00007.flac	to uh when we were filming trainrected to jud apito and i i'd say
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00008.flac	like i just noticed o like what am i doing s i just made sure to not do that
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00009.flac	donnel trump doesn't pay his workers he won't reliease his tax his taxes there's never
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00010.flac	uh a nomine who's ever not released their taxes so um and
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00011.flac	i don't think you can have a i haven't had a conversation with anyone who doesn't like hillary where they've had anything meaningful to
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00012.flac	to spain or somewhere it's it's it's
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00013.flac	if it's not like sex within a relationship and youre leeping with someone new most likely it doesn't go well
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00014.flac	i you flew all the way here i'll just like drink enough that my body
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00015.flac	that i'll have sex with this guy u cause i felt like i owed him something
id10047_9T6zJ8nmjHI_00016.flac	and i think as a young woman you might get confused about that so
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00001.flac	do when youre kids and so the boys somehow talked us into that we were gonna flash them you know they had a really good argument like do it and
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00002.flac	and all the boys looked at me and i did not have the biggest boops at all of the crew
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00003.flac	for for my whole life i'm always the likeveeling too much like oh i thought we were all admitting  real things about ourselves  like no
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00004.flac	like walking hipocrits i think pretty much like we there's so many sides to all of us and i i'm you know very um charged politically and i really care about the world but that doesn't mean that i don't go home and watch every real housewives and you know and every batchlar et it's just
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00005.flac	i think and we were taing ot the scale it's just so strange people always they'll say um i usually don't like female comics but you're okay and i'm like would you go up and say i don't usually like black
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00006.flac	just it's i think a  specification that doesn't need to be made because some people they'll say you're
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00007.flac	i was thirteen years old yeah and so just like with my stand up before i talk about anybody on stage or uh you know if i'm doing rat anything i clear it
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00008.flac	so i asked my mom she read it i said if you don' wat me to write any of it i won't if you wanna write a response or if correct anything and uh the only correction she made was that uh hebrewe school was on
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00009.flac	think it just seems like very tiring to have them um
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00010.flac	you know usually something happens but i really try to just enjoy the moment and how your feeling now
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00011.flac	yeah i tk you know the last note of myo if you uh in case you don't have any jees in your life when you have a
id10047_Db9N4zr4XlQ_00012.flac	do a good job but then everybody laughed and then i laughed and it was like oh that's better than if it had
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00001.flac	uh so i kind of just think of the worst thing or the funniest thing i could say in a situation
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00002.flac	yeah yeah sont theng a little bit better but um and then describing my humor that's hard if you were gonna describe yourself as a
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00003.flac	uh soffmore year of college so when i was about nineteen twenty
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00004.flac	the parts of my family are really autobiographical and so i wanted to just kind of get the story and and of a girl like this like a woman
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00005.flac	i jud and i were were working on the script
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00006.flac	he heard me on howards stirn that radio show and wanted to met just have a general
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00007.flac	i've heard him say that he thought that i'm someone he'd wannto follow around and see what they do during the day
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00008.flac	he encoraged me to rite a movie which iu had never done and and so he was we were kind af collaborating through the whole process i was sending him scenes
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00009.flac	he encouraged me to rit a movie which iu had never done and and so he was we were kind af collaborating through the whole process i was sending him
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00010.flac	i don't remember thinking that there would would be a bunch of male
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00011.flac	and yeah actually it was more jud's call you wonder what's going on there but i think you're right i feel like we all grew up you know with the male gays kinda born into us and we're used to
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00012.flac	slow pan up from the woman's heel and then you know a guy it's kind of shocking to see a a guy without all his clothes on cause we're not used to that but um it's a nice
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00013.flac	u he really found that character on his own it was written that
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00014.flac	gonna be a guy who cares about working out a lot and he's more into me than i'm into him but then he sort of he really created his own character and and just took the script and ran with it and
id10047_iSKf4XrzNwI_00015.flac	we've been here bor we came here and uh i think we just went to like interlockan and smoked a bunch of hash
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00001.flac	deeply deeply upset and like in a viseral like personal way and i was very confused cause i've never been through an eviction i've never but i somehow knew what it was i somehow understood in a in a emotional personal
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00002.flac	we so by doing that we're exciling parts of ourself that uh we that the tht the culture doesn't deam uh worthy because uh you know if we
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00003.flac	its that there's a fear that we're going to be exiled ourselves entirely or rejected which is what this part of this story is about
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00004.flac	n the avicting are not happy the people who are being avicted are definitely not happy it's a culture that it's
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00005.flac	people against each other and uh stripping us of our ability to create real community an it's whell it's making it's not it's we we still have the ability it it's just really hard work to care for each other in the
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00006.flac	um where the imagination gets you out of whatever situation you're in
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00007.flac	umn it's it's it's usually if there are two two easy options out
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00008.flac	and yeah tragic um well it goes back to what does or culture value um it values
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00009.flac	um thats uh that kind of again exiles and devalues
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00010.flac	all of the abundeant beauty that the world has and uh
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00011.flac	it's very very limited and it's very narrow and suductive yeah there's there's a lot of suduction that goes on in
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00012.flac	that we um are told to worschip you know you can tell the religion of a of a city or of a town by the taulest building um so we know what that is in
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00013.flac	things that we're told make us worthy human beings if we are on the top floor of that building or if our bank balanceis arcer
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00014.flac	n bulshit i'm sorry it's so i don't know if you can use that it's bullshit though it's um it's o it's uh it's it's death of a salesman it's willy lomanism it's uh it's this it's this falce
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00015.flac	that uh more is better um it's it's you know supersize me it's all this it's all this kind of madness um that that that that we're going toward um so yeah we're within the the the industry of hollywood yeah there's
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00016.flac	noi have i i i i know that i know what that is and i know what it is to be tempted
id10052_J2Vod4IfvhQ_00017.flac	no i actually just would like to be who i am and i like you to be who you are
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00001.flac	yeh i i i i i i i watched it more from ha like you know inspiration standpoint then then from a ah sexual
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00002.flac	ainspiration from anywhere uman when when it comes to this character cause it's everyones it belongs to
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00003.flac	it hasn'treally started yet you know when the film comes out it's gonna be a different thing the comico thing was a big important thing for me
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00004.flac	about just going to comecon and and being and being subjected to to
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00005.flac	to make sure that everyone knew that i was just them and i we're all the same and i'm
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00006.flac	that uh that that's able to you know tha that that that has a that has a kind of defensi
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00007.flac	a a difficult difficult access aspect um so so there there was that and and you know there there's so much dimentioned to peter parkar is he's i think he finds a a confidence when he when he finds his power and
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00008.flac	peater parker is he's i think he finds a a confidence when he when he finds his power and that
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00009.flac	a kind of a rebelliousness that um that he hadn't been able to access before um and the rebellious not only comes ut
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00010.flac	um you know finding u trying to find out who the hell he is but also after his uncle dies there's something um about that psychologically that you wanna run away from and then you wan na kick out againstbcause he feels a
id10052_Mj7gyT2Rekw_00011.flac	cogel william spencer um and and put him a newtube and you and you'll find his hs his skate reals and you'll be
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00001.flac	yeah i mean it's it's very very strange being a part of a film that um people like you know uh it's it's uh when you make a film i think um you you put all your cair and your passion into it as a collective group of people and then um you have to kind of accept that people may may may dislikeo hate it in fact so so so when people respond on mass in a in a positive way i it can't really be um ignored and you and you you have to
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00002.flac	images of of i don't know you know car explosions and and you know the the the usual thing is that we go
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00003.flac	oves foure but uh of course then you you hear erean sorken and david finsher ar involved in the movie in somer in in some way and you kind of go well the pretty smart guys and and i'm gonna trust that the they're
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00004.flac	but it just kind o flew by it's ditent and all the script is in the film like word for word like it's all the very very fast so yeah it was incredibly
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00005.flac	right yeah yeah yeah but yeh yes absolutely but at the same time i you know i i feel like um comicg books ar a
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00006.flac	kind of mythology our greek mythology like a modern kind of greek mythology and i i kind of acquaite the themes um and i and i
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00007.flac	things you'll you'll find in shakespeare or in escils or you know in in these um tragedies ind these greek tragedies so uh i feel like all of the the the the same human themes are are in there and uh it's it's it's just undera a different kind of
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00008.flac	you kindof go well this is gonna be great andd but then of course in n in practice it's obviously a great deal of hard work and and a great deal of pressure and
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00009.flac	aeme a lovely message through a mutual friend and uh he had i he he gave me his support and it meant a great
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00010.flac	go to the monaters and and watch whay i've done because i get very self consious and i'd like to kind of like not know what i'm my ebrows are doing arl the stupid thing that
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00011.flac	i think people care about the books so much and of course it's very difficult to adapt um such a beloved piece of piece of writing into cinamatic form andand it's  very
id10052__cJKlfHFAlw_00012.flac	i'm i'm yeah of course i' of u i i i think it probably does um my dad's american and my mom's brittish so i've had both accents in my ear so that
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00001.flac	the uh msm conventions they're great um but it's the first time i've done belfast so it's lovely to be
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00002.flac	sure yeah i think the last london one i did i think there was over a hundred
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00003.flac	not t the moment i mean if if the inim i've ben invited over to floridar i think i couldn't  man that cause i was filming i've never been invited to this sandago
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00004.flac	i wouldn't say weird i've got a fer few gifts from people no i wouldn't say there's anything weird you know normal stuff like
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00005.flac	um so i i i i probably would say not but i do like uh
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00006.flac	um but i'm u you know i i've got a i'v i've got a little one so i'm the
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00007.flac	ma that uh made a fevo uh short film o fats uh my last shot fim fo a finished wone the read uh
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00008.flac	after two weeks ago um which is great youit's really fantastic um but i i i love i love doing both i really genuinely love doing both
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00009.flac	you've got tao be in it to in itny so um and you do learn you know when i when i started i've acting since i was seven i'm forty five now um and it was terrible oh
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00010.flac	and be open be open minded and also i i think we
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00011.flac	the most success i've had careerwise is when i've stood out
id10053_8DpCIPN31Zo_00012.flac	embraced what i was as a person and and was able to bring that to the screen ain
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00001.flac	and yeah i fet i mean it's a funny one isn't it cause you know the fans are gonna be
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00002.flac	that he go yeah and the drama you don't know i anybody could go if he's gonna go then anybody could go and um but you know he was our lead
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00003.flac	gotten  a thing back from my agent when they really loved you but they didn't believe anything you said cause you pronounced
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00004.flac	conner and abiaare in the show you know they e surprising they take to it very quickly you know we have that
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00005.flac	doblin um they decided to make our own versions of the tranquiliz guns which was
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00006.flac	yeah so they kinda made these gus but yeah the the art designer and it was amazing they the the wer
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00007.flac	and yeah some of the stuff they used as well to make the show look very cool and sifer you wouldn't you know i'm talking t
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00008.flac	they might uh they might revisit it we'll see we shell see so it wouldn't
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00009.flac	t who for instance they had a lot of practical things you know and maybe less
id10053_aTx3dzQRenY_00010.flac	it it's genuinely really something out of a horror film and i thought the episode
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00001.flac	it was brilliant ind the place the theater we had glasgo was amazing as well 's a proper light cinnima um and the response was brilliant so it was i was lovely actually i premiar two episodes actually in glasgo and it's always going down really really
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00002.flac	i seem to like it i bot it'sh it's nice as well cause the uh it was kinda los big episode he plays pixy and shes from
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00003.flac	m for that so when people watch out about the gu oh right okay yeah it was so but it came out i l i
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00004.flac	yeah basically it's u isgrase cop goes back to work his coligs don't like him he's bit o made a bitf he's bit of a maverit he made a bit of a mess of his career and he goes back to work and he gets partnered with an  unete called unite white who's experimental and he just sees it as a baby sitting job he thinks o because you don't like me i've been given looking after
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00005.flac	crack piece tec um and basically unite w is uh yeah a talking car but shews wyleusly connected to anything so thats what makes hir kind of interesting the even more interestg thing about her is that she's being given tha thing called the pulse and the pulse enables her to feel and learn emotion so that means she develops
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00006.flac	um so within the it's all set on one day within the day sheill go through every sort of human emotion that we've hade to deal with them in our life in one day and have to get over each one as they come up create problems and feed into the next one and it's about them to e working together to to survive the day from the
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00007.flac	the scene whe i can't give too much away but u we
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00008.flac	in my mind exactly um so i do try and keep things
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00009.flac	to go from here to to the screen obviously sometimes you can't get it that way sometimes things work better and it's  what you expected um but yeah i know i'm a bit like a conductor when i head it i don't kow this sounds weird but i'll stand back and i'll be like the points and it's hie's hi he's got a lot of music in it and that's very important to the pase an and literally i'l i'll
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00010.flac	like a conductor when hesa  gone  like that's that point that's that point that works that makes you laugh that doesn't you knowit's very
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00011.flac	when i show it for the first time i i am nervous i'm not nervous about putting it out on line i'm more nervous about showing it like to me
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00012.flac	you know i i do a lot of my work and stuff i do i've always done for my kinda family and stuff an that's you know as much as everybody elsee's opinion is is is really
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00013.flac	whether the guambits are all good or bad whether they'e bean infiltrit id you know who's controlling them
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00014.flac	so the story just i mean don't we know what we're doing we know exactly where it's gonna end up um and it will be all explained in the end um but yeah in in a way because
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00015.flac	um but hopefully when you sit back and watch it all you know
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00016.flac	a friend of mine rachiel  i just did a movie with um she uh cause weve only just met she watched it all in one go so and she said it was
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00017.flac	iit was like how how long did it take you like o aboute an hour and a half i was lik oh i've made about an hour and alf or tv
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00018.flac	but there's a backstory between cro and uh
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00019.flac	the whll it's the i think he's a man at the moment is cro and he's pretty much dealing with it as it happens but like for instance when robecka goes give me a my flat kee back and he's like
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00020.flac	it's in the car  t's probably not in the car is it it's bro in his pocket so he doesn't want to detach
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00021.flac	and ther little storie's got somewhere to go as well but there's there's gonna be some switching up there's gonna be some betrayal going on very soon and hopefully some
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00022.flac	do't the probably is a lot but i can't think off the top of my head um i mean we we wrote this story in our heads a long time ago and it's not
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00023.flac	it's not really gone off track in a sense we knew the ark of each character that hasn't changed much there hasn' been
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00024.flac	no but is i he's tru but but what we came with that  that actually opened another doer
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00025.flac	try and get my sister into it that opened another daugteor another character wha she opened another darter wer a
id10053_dcPyPgsQ-3Y_00026.flac	side of a relationship which it actually made it better in the long
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00001.flac	but uh so i just so jisond and uh a and uh that's swimming pool
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00002.flac	i mean i i'd read some of the stories yeah i think the guys who write i mark gages and steven moffirt are huge um uh shirlock and enthusiasts you know so i think
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00003.flac	fl is because ther there's nothing synical about it you know they love it they they they know all the versions of it and ah ah so i think
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00004.flac	don't think people thought that they were gonna see me as morriearty i don't think the the tv audience had any relationship with sha base which i think kinda helpe
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00005.flac	you know that it wasn't a a a tv face at u at u at the time and um uh so yeah i think you gotta just look at you know the the darkside of your own self so then you can sort of create something that's a little bit more original you know um and i think they're very clever in that they don't over use the character you know a litle bit like hanabl lector i think if you he's only in twenty minutes of of the silence at the lams i think it's it's it's the talking about him and it's the it's the um it's the
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00006.flac	think i think going with that i think if you're gonna gonna be audatious and cast somebody like me in in in that in that in that character you might as well go the hole ho
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00007.flac	i don't i don't think you cod uh we couldn't have uh forseen how how successful i always knew that it was gonna be a a a a  a big
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00008.flac	fantastic he's uh uuh both of us um uh inda came from the theater you know uh i think u i think because we were both you know in ou early thirties when when shirlock started and so i think it's quite good for actors to
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00009.flac	do things that you don't really want to do and you start going after things for the for the wrong reasons and um yeah i think we had ten years on new benedict u as a as a theater actor for for years or ound a the scene and uh so yeah i think the quality of the writing and  th the sort of theatrical nature of the writing really helped us i think he's a i think he's a real real star and he's a great po and to how hou
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00010.flac	you get the ocasional you get the ocasional od uh person yes uh but no for the most part
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00011.flac	nd things you know people really like tand it's sold to two hundred and twenty countries all around the world so and
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00012.flac	yeah we  we last year we shot m a film called the stag bois um a a film with
id10055_Wx0bpIP4VEQ_00013.flac	sarted up the  doblin amd umd mountains and it's about um kind of modern  irish males um people have benasking me reacently if it's if it's like the kind of the irish version of tha hangover
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00001.flac	i i think i i i think the the a older i get and well maybe not the i've always been a bit um uh quite physical you know i think of things sort ofa words i love words you
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00002.flac	ys watching watching myself and um so when we saw thiss the screening first i mean i
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00003.flac	help no i don't think that would help i think youd have to try and sort of forget about it so i v ill i don't ll i i i i i haven't watched
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00004.flac	yeah yeah yeah but it's a it is a it's a it's a really interesting thing but no i don't ii wouldn't
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00005.flac	that said a great mistake that you make when you're casting something
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00006.flac	a sort of um a a a kinship with that and an of course i think about my own family and people
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00007.flac	yeah i think it's i think i think actors can sometimes move too far away from that that's what you're supposed that's what you're supposed to have chiefly is uh is an imagination and i feel that if
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00008.flac	no the opposite of of love i sort of and um yeah so if you've got an imagination you can if you use yourself you know and that's maybe why i don't do too much um looking at
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00009.flac	if that happene to me if there's something awful like that happene to me and try not to act or how would i be if i was a if i was a so
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00010.flac	then it can't be anything but your own and that's what i think you know one's
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00011.flac	well when i first read it i was like it's a really it's a thing where you know when you have to do a job because you're like
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00012.flac	in uh in the jerwoods basin and simon came to watch it and iwas
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00013.flac	i remember that very very clearly actually because i remember thinking you'd have to give all your energy to sewe um but yeah there's a tat n
id10055_fEKabIQYh-Q_00014.flac	yeah tats tiring when we did it at the end festival i found it tiring because we uh we had to do it at nine um in the morning
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00001.flac	um mack denby u and his cod name is sc who is the new um head of an organization called cns which is the center for
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00002.flac	yeah he's one of those guys i he's uh he's uh he's he's quite uh pash and he's not lacking in um uh self confidence uh i mean he's inteligent all i think those guys
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00003.flac	you know we all uh are a little fearful of i think in the digetlage and um so yeah he's uh he's uh
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00004.flac	aand of course uh you know we have to we have to embrace the technology that we have because it does make things safer but and the idea of just training cameras on everybody at
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00005.flac	unnecessarily is uh is questionable and should be questioned and uh so it was important that we had an i an idea that was sort of a rational idea that that actually hes he's not
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00006.flac	really really agree with some of the ideas of of cns in the film and i'm not sure that i would myself personally but uh there's there's an argument to be said for to be had for um for some of the things he
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00007.flac	it was one  one of the things that i was um quite scared of a lot of the films and that i've done ha've been sort of more loky and more independent films anda bit of theater and everything and so my worry a little bit
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00008.flac	y you get sort of lost in a in the huge multy million dollar yum action movie du bond
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00009.flac	n your door and tisa what if we what if we make sure we have the beat here and then i felt that i could speak at anystage about saying you know
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00010.flac	don't want to be bullied no matter what the budget of of it is into doing something
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00011.flac	um uh fakness or stuff that they've sort ove seen before so i feel like it's important that that tha the new onisom stuff is uh um remains
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00012.flac	i feel like it's important that that tha the new onses of stuff is uh um remains and
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00013.flac	i i know som we did a play together some years ago on broadway and that's how we how we met and i think uh that a that's the same with a lot of the actors in and bonter rafe raife and danial himself and ben wishal wr weking here and they're all
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00014.flac	andactually what i love about uh spector when you see it is that that that sort of melancolly that danial had in
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00015.flac	certain uh um tt you have a much larger budget and you're shooting it in pinewood i mean it doesn't sort of esca escape you that you you're in the walls of emy five um but actually after a few days i mean the i i always say the first couple of da
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00016.flac	fe days uh no it was just like making another film and you go how do you make it right and um and thit takes as much it's it's exactly the same um method as it as is
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00017.flac	tyeah it's all i that's thot uh anywayh don't slet the small stuff as a say but it is yeah you just not
id10055_spPCNcMKaj4_00018.flac	i hope to yeah i think my famlye're coming over and it's a big old deal and uh yeah now it's important ttt i it can be quite
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00001.flac	it was time off uh returning baby birds that had fallen out of the nest back to the
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00002.flac	it's pretty great i i i as i like to say well because its california i dress like a togler
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00003.flac	but on my work weeks i don't have to put on shos so it's like i'm a a bearr
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00004.flac	adhere uh just uh you know stayed here uh trying to get my daughter  to not open presence uh you know mes you know she just was pestering us from like januaro from december nineteenth can't i just open one lit come on just wa i is this little one
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00005.flac	no no we wait we they get one on christmas eve uh and the big one that she got we we
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00006.flac	forit was more complicated than my morgage uh just to sine in
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00007.flac	grahics thing and they build thir own worlds and explore it  except um she wants me to watch her do
id10056_5tgoikTak5A_00008.flac	atd it but she' still is normal nor she goes up stairs when it starts to know that like she's too far away like i'm busy ou know a you know a she's watching something on her

id10056_ObPcP4a-a4I_00017.flac	it was like tiger wood's going how about a charity galf turnament where
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00006.flac	like a teenager i couldn't focus  my bouss had talk to me and o i could think ws like the president think
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00007.flac	he'd been choing gum right before as i think it was razels so i
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00008.flac	it wasn't always sexual but it was physical cause uh we'd resle a lot
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00009.flac	hed spilk words on my back with his finger and i'd have to guess what it was soe times he sfelt tickle and i gues tickle and he
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00010.flac	well yeah that's literally having sex with a
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00011.flac	my hands are small i know but they're not yours they are my
id10056_zcypXF7OVKo_00012.flac	i forget it like sorry i'm not quoating the andrew's syster richard
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00001.flac	i don't think any of us could engage with that i don't think we could engage with what lamis has been the history of it
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00002.flac	its stature i think we all came in knowing what our own feelings about the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00003.flac	uh were and our own love for it and i think we just wanted to honor the st the the stature that it's had in our own lives i think that was kind of where we began and that was the thing that motivated us
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00004.flac	knew the show backwards i learned the show when i was a kid and so you know i i remember i used to sit on my um my stairs
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00005.flac	there's just something about it that that is so liberating and and fun and
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00006.flac	it wasn't it wasn't it just seemed really exciting to me you know because i don't i i don't i i i i traditionally have not enjoyed movies when there's playback i think
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00007.flac	tht 'vever seen really nale ad is marrian cotiard and in uh levieonrose and uh maybe jamy fox and and and you know reay and things like that but but a lot of times i don't know it can kind of had a have a stultifying effect on on the procedings and i think
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00008.flac	things were unexpected feel like you couldn't quite get comfortable with it because you didn't know hit's gonna happen next
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00009.flac	and you know i think that i had opportunities in the in performing it in film that a lot of actresses don't have
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00010.flac	of it you have to project to the back of the audience you know an idea that you have if you know your character has a thought you must project the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00011.flac	you kno to the cheep seets and i just think on on film you don't have to put that much effort into it you can kind of sit back and make it a little bit more conversational but i think that's always the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00012.flac	there was i wish there were more but there was one definite moment when
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00013.flac	i's the sort of thing where they ya'll cut and you remember that you're acting you're like oh no i'm oh no i'm back now i
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00014.flac	and i and i it was a gorgous sound tract to have that moment too and it made me feel uh weirdly enogh it shouldhavemade me feel more silly but it actually if it made me
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00015.flac	for he jackman that we can finally see so many of his gifts on this place still not all of them there's no dancing in this one and the man can dance and um velljon waill he has a certain charm is not as charming as hu jackman
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00016.flac	all of the things that hou can do that they're so rare to find in one performer on the
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00017.flac	and i know he would join me in saying the biggest surprise of this entire experience was russel crow i 've never
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00018.flac	diging deeper or work harder and i think the film is so lucky to have his
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00019.flac	this could be a really bad idea why did i agree to this i had a lot of my frinds where actresses just kind of
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00020.flac	to do it i needed it to be real um i i i've i've kind of intellectualized why but this
id10061_FiS_89JghYQ_00021.flac	feeling um i knew it was gonna be more meaningful because and what her sacrifice is so meaningful and i just thought if we did it for real people mike
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00001.flac	just the audition process it was you know first it was rumored that chriss was considering a new female character and then it was okay so he's konna meet with a couple girls and then it was then he told me what the character was and then it was whether or not you were gonna be one of the girls invited to screen test so it was the three and a half month process so by the time i
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00002.flac	i was it just seemed like it it couldn't possibly happen i mean id i i loved the
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00003.flac	t and then i went to set and it was one of the best experiences i've ever had working on a movie
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00004.flac	i didn't even know it was because it i mean there's something chris chris got a star in the hollywood walk of fame today and
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00005.flac	and it just didn't seem possible that it would be a reality in my life and so the
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00006.flac	i thought this would happen to me and it's the same thing you just don't imagine thatb because michel fifers performance is so iconic um you just don't think that that opportunity i'll ever come up again and the fact that it did while i was the right age i just it's kind a mind blowing but it's it's a it it's a it's a postum it's after the fact it's
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00007.flac	anted me to do and a lot of the fighting styles and chris had said he wanted me to do all of the things that uh that i could um and i'm a hiper competitive person so i was like i ganna do it all i'm do everything um so it was about getting myself
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00008.flac	adeep  i know thias sounds weird because there shouldn't be degrees of authenticity but he's a deeply authentic person very very much
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00009.flac	himself he's one of the smartest people i've ever met and he's just a
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00010.flac	ji loved him instantly and i still do i think he's adorable and um and he's just such a great great great great actor i just every day was
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00011.flac	lartin from the people that i work with i mean especially when you're in this kind of company i mean i i remember coming in one day and i saw jo and i'm like hey you had that sene with oldman the other day hel
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00012.flac	but it was uh i mean it was a master class every day everybody that you saw work and everybody had
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00013.flac	i you know everyone comes from such different backgrounds but somehow everyone found the same
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00014.flac	really good person um he's a wonderful father and so i think he's able to uh be amidst be in the midst of caos and keep his cool um and he's also just
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00015.flac	he's he's he's kinda to good to be true  everything about this film he drinks a lot of tea he drinks a he dink a tremendous amount of tee i believe that's the secret
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00016.flac	the camera test and i still had awased to go before i was happy with it but i did have a moment where i was standing with um tom who was in the full baine get up and then christion was wearing the bat sut and i was dressed as catwoman and i said this is either going to work spectacularly or we're going to look like rejex from
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00017.flac	and that wan that oneis not disimilar to this one where you just couldn't believe the talent that was around you um and how professional and hard working everyone is
id10061_SFMhpLiLgWo_00018.flac	and it was very scary to to go to some of theplaces i had to go to as this character but um i had so much support and i it's
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00001.flac	ambicious and potentially wonderful film i i thought the screen play was incredible and so incredible that i forgot to focus on my character and i just thougt oh wa mo who is she who is she i'm supposed to give chris an anwer about this
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00002.flac	about the movie i love that it trusts in the inteligence of its audience you know it's a challenging film it's challenging to to i think it's gonna be challenging intellectually but it's also challenging emotionally and so far all the reports that we've gotten back are that people feel transported by the journey they feel opened because of it and people seem to be responding to the film which is great cause that's the way i felt when i first read
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00003.flac	it would give away uh i can i i play an astro byologist i'm a lout to talk about that and i am part of the
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00004.flac	to save mankind but i can't tell you what from what or where we're going or anything else
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00005.flac	it is it is it's a very well we're trying to protect people's uh ability to enjoy
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00006.flac	it was it was i had a great time working with him u as a as a person and as an actor
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00007.flac	um he cares about what he does so much and
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00008.flac	to because it's the way i like to do things but he also you know in between
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00009.flac	amazing stories you know he's a he's a he's a person who's really lived his life and
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00010.flac	i started off the film with a great sense of admiration for him and honestly it increased every single day and to the point where now he's he's just one of my favorite people i i'm i'm a big believer inm mathou
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00011.flac	um how did i go i mean i just i looked at the film and i looked at the lines that i had in it a lot of which were science based and i just thought okay you have to understand what it is that you're saying t the best of your ability so i just worked really hard at exploring the concepts i thought about ecause the movie's not really about her persay even though she's a big part of the film and uh she goes on an emotional journey but that's not necessarily crucial to the film either but i had to know what it was that i was doing so i worked very hard
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00012.flac	in uh creating a backstory for her that uh that i could then that would then inform my
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00013.flac	well i don't know oh i dot i i i would not presume to to say that um he loves
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00014.flac	his film um he's excelent at making great films but i think the person that he is is a father you know i think that's probably the most
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00015.flac	an amazing father um from as far as i can tell he's a wonderful husband to his wife ema tommas who's also his producing partner
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00016.flac	and a deeply thinking really compassionate human being and that's not something you necessarily put together a lot of times when people are deep thinkers they they can be intimidating or judgemental or maybe they don't suffer fools gladly chris is a man of enormous patience and i i
id10061_ZHngnr_39ss_00017.flac	ou know in the beginning i was intimidated to go to him with problems with the character caus the didn't wanna bug him but he's really not that sort of person he um he's pretty approachable as a
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00001.flac	you got to see bela grow up and you get to see the progression of her kind of turning into a woman and and getting married and you know having children and dealing with forever and um you know i think it's a beautiful thing and
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00002.flac	something that's very relatable so um i'm really excited for everyone to kind of
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00003.flac	you know alise collen she's purky and sing songi and um and very loving and welcoming and u
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00004.flac	um you know at points become a little sascy and at points become very dangerous and so um i kind of feel
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00005.flac	dmental picture um and being able to kind of let that play ocross your es and and a low of people to see you really seeing this thing happening in your mind um and i had you know help definitely working with billcon and saying what do you think about this idea what doyou think about this what should she be seeing because there's a lot of greay arieas in that because i can't see the future and so uh there was a lot of time spent you know making sure we kind of agreed on
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00006.flac	process every day um that is the one thing that i probably will not mis is the contax because you couldn't see anything but um i will say you know it took about two hours every day and i will say the one positive thing about all that was that um hen it completely transformes you and i think they you know people were
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00007.flac	they love the books and they love this character alice and they wanna see alice and so it's it was really cool to kind of bring her to life every day um but i think also that process kind ofh forces you to um be become these vampires and because we didn't have perfiral vision i think it kind of cauht us off a little bit from the world and
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00008.flac	and just gave us more of a sense of being uh cold and
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00009.flac	my life has changed since i started twilite except for my friends and family um which i think they keep me grounded in sane but it's been i mean it's just been amazing and kind of a whorlend and um i think every day it's been a new adventure and you never quite know what's gonna happen and it's kind of presented so many opportunities that i um
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00010.flac	i mean i can't imagine my life without twilight now but uh i couldn't have dreampte this opora imagined you know that i was gonna be a part of something that was
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00011.flac	senu i do um feel very flattered and excited that you know there could potentially be a spet off for alice because i love the
id10072_DjkYU8gcEvM_00012.flac	just as much as everybody else and um and i think it would be a really fun thing um but of course
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00001.flac	andso i wred it and um i just really responded to the material and um i responded to the film as a whole and
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00002.flac	kind of strong yet vonerable character she as kind of both sides and um i kind of liked her she was kind of
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00003.flac	a little bit on the wold more so than some other characters so it was really drom to her
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00004.flac	oum lo las heartbreak trying to go from
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00005.flac	dulthood and having to adapt um i think to the change that was happening and um and so i i loved it and said i you know would love to meet the director on this and so i went in and read
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00006.flac	they thankfully responded to me as well and then i had to go back and and chemistry rid and
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00007.flac	yeah and it was you know one of those things where it was so organic and easy and simple and we just
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00008.flac	it was in sreeport louisiana we only shot at actual small part in texus um but they felt that sreeport had enough of the
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00009.flac	mo it was kind of awsome fit um but no i really was not familiar with the aighties and um one of the best things that the producers actually an director did was they gave um the
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00010.flac	they would potentially use or um that was relevant or that they you know remembered from their past time and so that was really nice to have
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00011.flac	ivolved um so that was uh very helpful and then you know we had consultations with hair and makeup and and the wardrobe and stuff like that but um but no before it wasn't really um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00012.flac	fun like bonding experience and um you know we kind of lived out some of the
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00013.flac	i mean i mean i'm very thankful for that because he was playing my brother and it made it very easy um to really genuinely care
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00014.flac	i mean it's huge landwise but it's that kind of a little bit of the small town mentality and and a bit southern and so um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00015.flac	i don't think to the extrem of what you see in skateline i definitely kind of have a tasete of that
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00016.flac	i weanbut u that and the ice skitting rink we hung out for a long time i think in the middl
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00017.flac	know himself anymore uh and the mal the mallstene where he brings me a nice
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00018.flac	and that whole thing uh we had to do that scene i in particular had to do um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00019.flac	in a modeling class and i just kind of they also had commercials and acting and so i just kind of
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00020.flac	you know because it's tough china to pay rent and a like but um but i started in
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00021.flac	in a modeling class and i just kind of they also had commercials ind acting and so i just kind of you know went from one to the next and then um when i was like sixteen i just
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00022.flac	ok for so long just to get any kind of parden so um you know after that started happening i was just i wanted to work and i was
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00023.flac	done much before twilight and so everything that i did do was knew and something i hadn't played before and
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00024.flac	ner and a different character and so um you know they're all coming out this year and i think it'll be
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00025.flac	we are in the midst of it we're coming towards the end of of
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00026.flac	rein different parts of of canada um but then we'll we'll rap out there and we'll be done
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00027.flac	each of the films has been siverely different and they have very um i think different themes and and um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00028.flac	nto be darker than others and um and some moments or being more magicale than others and i think um that you know they've done a really good job at kind of selecting it
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00029.flac	in the film and so they've all been very severely different
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00030.flac	and he has a way i think of working with us and and really pulling things out and so i'm um
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00031.flac	yeah well the the thing that attracted me to oporition is that they you know when i sat down and i talked to tod and i talked to
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00032.flac	rand bein more elevated and some of the movies they referanced that i watched for like rose mary's baby and polter gust and and films like that that we're just
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00033.flac	know blood and goor and horror and and that's kind of the same thing that we wanted to accomplish wit th opporition um is is
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00034.flac	it's not the typical warfilm and and we are doing everything that a normal person would do um you know rather than doing the cheep thrill scar or movie tactics and so um that was a
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00035.flac	uh you know really wanted cali to be
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00036.flac	stpid and they're not i meants to be blond but they're they're not smart and er they're not proactive and so that was um a big motivator for me as well and um you know from the getgo they have just been very collaborative with me and with subastian who plays my love
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00037.flac	uh i have seen some of it in there um we were actually doing
id10072_M5lYNe7y2QY_00038.flac	sorgna change a couple of things to kind of t weekan find tun everything um i saw i saw the film without any kind of special fect an any music which
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00001.flac	you know i think if if um a situation presented itself such is what happened in eclips um and it was my family
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00002.flac	u as i relate to alice a lot in the fact that she adoores and loves her family and their her life so uh i don't know if any other circumstances makes me do
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00003.flac	um no not because of that i think there's a difference in the sense that um we are a little more comfortable with ourselves and in our skin and with our characters um i think that maybe part of the reason it is such a success is because we have i mean we have great writing we all love our jobs we
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00004.flac	honestly we love what we do and we love our fans and uh i don't think any of us wanna
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00005.flac	uh one are just so moved that everyone else is as passionate about our characters as we are because we really do love what we're doing um and as an actor you want to emmerse someone in this world that you've created and you want to affect them and so the fact that these girls are
id10072_pKu03mxA25k_00006.flac	yelling and it's just it's it warms your heart it's a really amazing thing
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00001.flac	um i enjoyed the wedding episode i enjoyed playing a robot and and the idea that she couldn't be photographed was histerical to me and when he said i do she said i do instead of him you know things like that were very funny i did not agree that they should h've
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00002.flac	that was something i didn't think should ever have happened because first of all it couldn't they weren't the same
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00003.flac	the script was good um i loved the show with the lion
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00004.flac	was a lion he thought  u i told him i needed a pet i was lonely and he said allright aulright bring fatahaba or whatever his name was back go ahead bring him back and of course i'd bring him back and he's a nine hundred pound lion
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00005.flac	now i had done um several films at fox with lions and had worked with trainers and i thought i was a lion
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00006.flac	but i did know you're supposed to let them become familiar with you and be friends and feed them a little meet uh i knew things like you don't stand too close to them you cand scratch their ears but you're ready to jump because they could break your leg not on purpos but they're big and so the first day the lion
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00007.flac	i went to larry and i said larry let's go over and make friends with the lion and he said make friends with the lion i said yeah we should go over and feed him a little meet and make friends i'm not gonna make friends with any blacgay blak blank
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00008.flac	and i i made friends with the lion fit him his meet scratched his ears and then we
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00009.flac	and the the scene i was sitting on the on the sofa and larry was sitting next to me and i was to
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00010.flac	and the lion came in over the back of the sofa with his big paws and at my side near my thiy they put a bol of raw meet and so we rehearsed this without lary and the lion would come in and he aite the meett and he'd look around he was really happy happy with the camera opperater happy with the gafher the lighting guys they were all the crew was all around the crew was happy with the
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00011.flac	and i don't blame him i don't blame him but not only was larry gone the camera was over on its side every one of those guys on that crew
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00012.flac	they didn't they didn't leave they ran they had to relight the whole set the lion climed over the back of the sofa and got in my lap and he was
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00013.flac	and iw i was sitting in the sope and he was over in a shot and in my lap and it was it really wasn't frightening the the rore was frighteng cause it was so loud
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00014.flac	wan to get close to somebody this was not what he thought it was gonna be
id10078_EOZW9v37FEI_00015.flac	were in a shot and in my lap and it was it really wasn't frightening the the rore was frightng cause it was so loud
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00001.flac	know if they asked me for me or if i was sold to them for it but uh i was very happy that it did it was a wonderful experience it was based on the
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00002.flac	i was very happy that it did it was a wonderful experience it was based on the the song hearper valy
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00003.flac	where the moma went my moma went to the pt and told them olf they said her skirts are too short mies
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00004.flac	very had her own ideas about how things should be she was not very conservative at all uh she wasn't a bad woman but and she was a good
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00005.flac	because she wasn't like the other mommes she was uh prettier but she was also kind a swinger you know she she liked to dance she liked to drink a bear once in a while and um she went to church but uh when she walked in everybody
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00006.flac	i don't know who's idea it was to buy it as a television series enbc
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00007.flac	the people who owned the property i have no idea all i know is one day they called and said would you do it and i said o yeah o it was
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00008.flac	more they they exagurated the characters more um the problem with the show was that no one could decide who was the boss on the show if the producer was or the director was and so the second year they they got a different producer in
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00009.flac	uh i had nothing to say about it i was very unhappy about it actually but sherwold
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00010.flac	and they did a fabulous job i don't know who was unhappy with them but somebody was and um
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00011.flac	second year so that it was constantly going zigging and zagging going in different directions and with different casts and different
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00012.flac	that isn't healthy for anyone i don't know it was everyone's idea of what comedy is you know they each
id10078_mKOmIJhv7nA_00013.flac	um the problem with the show
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00001.flac	has to let her son grow up and doesn't want to wants to get him out of the army and so uh she doesn't join the army but she takes on someone else's
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00002.flac	and there you get the comedy of course it's really about bonding and and
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00003.flac	and uh she finds out uh he he writes her a letter and tells her that instead of going to college he joind the armey and of course his father uh died when he jumped out of an airoplane in vat nom and the parashoot didn't open so the mother is understandably nervous about him going into the armey
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00004.flac	me well that's a contract with a studio or a network to do uh so many shows mine is a pilot in six shows
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00005.flac	a widdow a working mother no she's not either she's devorced that's right and has three children twelve
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00006.flac	meets an atturney marries him continues to study continues to work he has three
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00007.flac	that we had sidney sheldon creating the show and we had a wonderful cast who uh who
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00008.flac	fit together um that's
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00009.flac	and andy tried to get me fired because he thought i was a a disruptive influence in the barbers shop and then he ended up
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00010.flac	i do i think it's it's wonderful the people that do it i i like to look at them i think they're beautiful
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00011.flac	d love to you know the problem uh with uh being an actor
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00012.flac	that so often you you form really firm friendships with people and then don't see them for
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00013.flac	uh because uh as you know larry is doing a very popular series and and hopefully i will
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00014.flac	for a while i don i don't know what it's doing now i haven't seen it no one's told me anything about it so i guess it's not on the
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00015.flac	ell but the the movie was on about two months ago
id10078_vWHa4EanOB4_00016.flac	e's a very natural actor yes he played a half breed half
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00001.flac	jorge hown students ended up my junier summer at working at an investment
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00002.flac	and i think what happened is i had this experience where i'vd been making short
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00003.flac	i had this experience where mike and sa mike directed another eath sol directed sent of my
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00004.flac	underwater with work like taking a car home at three in the morning showering
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00005.flac	re like we're gonna make this film here's the topic we've gout forty iht hours let's do it and i was like okay so you rite this little short and do this film and stay up for two days
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00006.flac	knew exactly what kind of money i was tono make what life it would be like and and it all felt i wasn't passionate about murders and acquisitions i wasn't passionate
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00007.flac	and i saw that some of my colligues were you know and i thought this i just don't belong to
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00008.flac	and i'm gonna be a workahollic no matter what i might as well be a worka hollic
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00009.flac	wsreally that was really challenging but the place that i had arived at was that
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00010.flac	i love that i love that and then i saw as graduating from the fnd
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00011.flac	and so then it just became a question of okay how can i act in how can i act in the way that i would like to do it you know how can i
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00012.flac	i i had done plays and things in high school but no
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00013.flac	met this wonderful man hary master george and i studied with him and he's amazing
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00014.flac	this is what he told me the first day that i walked in te class this kina sound sort of like headdy and intelectual butit's not really
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00015.flac	epic macro part of the story first the more the sort of cience fiction element and then we worked backwards and the idea was how
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00016.flac	inthi sort of like si fie premise what human drama could we tell that
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00017.flac	talking to you or or me talking to me like what would that conversation be like we have that in our minds all day long thi's like in our personal dialog
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00018.flac	you know overnight becomes drastically different and how does she
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00019.flac	terrified by him and that remark and we loved the idea of casting somebody with that kind of gravitos and
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00020.flac	we um uh back o jorge shen when we first met we were we dated and we went to cuba together and we made the
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00021.flac	his courage is is unbelievable you know it's it's really difficult to make your
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00022.flac	not traditional way you know to not have no go into i with a lot of financing i mean it began with mike and i going to live at his mom's house with my sister and his friend
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00023.flac	we have a camera we have a laptop with final cut we have this crazy story idea let's try to make a movie and
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00024.flac	crto do now which is that you don't have to wait for permission anymore i mean before it's like if you came to le
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00025.flac	can't really think of it yeh we were inspired by the internet and the idea that at the time we were watching a lot of intreatment on our lap tops
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00026.flac	lon in my bedroom with the laptop watching this show that's about like unraveling thiss
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00027.flac	at night and i think we thought from that like what about writing a story that within the dna of the story you're taking advantage of what the web experience can do watching something on
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00028.flac	l you've driven all the way there you've park youve like gotten im i mean it has to be a really bad movie for you to walk out like you know so but withiif you tell is
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00029.flac	you have to at any point they can just close their lapp to and do something else you have to find
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00030.flac	luore them in it's a much more uh soductive
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00031.flac	and the idea of crafting a a a story where that was in the dna
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00032.flac	appeel to us because this is when obamma was happening and the the power of his campaign over the internet the way that
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00033.flac	nincredible woman came up to me after the end of their earth screening and this was after the kunaand
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00034.flac	she was uh she was crying and not in the way that you sometimes feel people cry at the theater which is i mean i do this i'm guilty
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00035.flac	their really high concept at  theyre kinda not were
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00036.flac	that infiltrates a cult that's meeting in the basement of this house in the san frenando vally and when they go there they meet at the safe house and they made to scrub down and put on hospital gowns and thei'r hands are bouwnd and they're blindfold they're put in a van
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00037.flac	sound my voice for instance i sat i think it it works as bot it works as both in a theatrical setting
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00038.flac	with micro budget filmmaking the question really becomes like whautld do you do with the
id10111_3FIiSPMPF1Y_00039.flac	take the place of that down the roaod like i wonder what thing could agrogate storie
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00001.flac	deo art and he made a video art piece at the time of uh himself
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00002.flac	and i was inspired by it i think he was too at the time we were also listening to a lot of doctor richard barnsons uh pulp physic sort of astro physic stuff on taped i think those two things came together and it kind
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00003.flac	the story was born and we just we wanted to tell a story about a duplicate earth and this sort of parolel reality and then we were like well what is a human drama
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00004.flac	where a confrontation with yourself would have the most emotional resonence
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00005.flac	to retell the human dramas that we often see but from like a slightly
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00006.flac	like a fresh sort of perspective and i think syfy also lets you talk about what's
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00007.flac	without being didactic and so that's i think sort of why we're both in te scifi
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00008.flac	that moment was tremendous i mean i can't even i don't think we ever thought that this story would reach such a wide
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00009.flac	move people that deeply like that response was overwhelming it was so visral
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00010.flac	to i think when you make a movie you know you don't make it in a vaccume you make it because you want
id10111_NtICHG3PV6A_00011.flac	and so i think hopefully we smuggled a little of that across and that was
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00001.flac	comes up with stories he directs he shoots he edits and he loves to do all of those things and that's part of how he really works as an artist is this complet sort of
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00002.flac	am an actor and that's what i love to do and i
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00003.flac	that inspired me and i didn't and i was reading a lot of stuff for women where the women are always
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00004.flac	daams o disstress and and uh i didn't wanna do that i didn't i didn't wanna i din' wanna be a part of putting out visions of girls into the world that like i wouldn't have wanted to take in as a little girl and so i thought h i'ld be cool to just write better stuff for women and
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00005.flac	so we started learning to write trying to read screenwiting books and trying to figure out how to tell a narative
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00006.flac	the kind of ideas that make you leave the theater with a sense of wonder like what is you know that sort of feeling and but we wanted to marry that with
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00007.flac	i don't know i i think we often went to the theater looking for those kinds of movies and didn't see them it's like films are either really spectical sort of high concept driven or there's you know small substantive dramas and you don't often see the two braided together and so we were trying to do that and it was a a difficult thing to crack in the writing of it because on one hand you're dealling with thes like huge lofty
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00008.flac	ky and the discovery of dopple gangers like what are people even like on the streets you know how are you dealling with that and then  you tryng to balance all of that thinking with what are
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00009.flac	you know genuin ways in which two people who have sort of suffered through tragedy together heel one another so a lot of like macro
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00010.flac	in the directing and in his vision of it because you could easily topple over into making a film that just seems not
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00011.flac	and sort of silly and i think it for him it was really important in the way he shot it and the way he eded it and all of the construction the colors everything for it to feel like a real story that this thing was happening to real people so much so that it has it would almost feel like what if you you know we're watching someone's home video and you just captured another planet in the skuy and that that kind of realism would make you believe and um so
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00012.flac	it's it's great writing is amazing and i i've spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to do that and i think i will always do that but even when you're writing with a collaborater things are coming from your sort of shaired point of view and that point of view is so
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00013.flac	who is like born in america who's in her twenties who has had a certain sort of experiences you see the world a certain way and
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00014.flac	thing that's so intoxicating about being an actor is that you get to
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00015.flac	los yourself in someone else's point of view their way of seeing things in a story that you never would have conceieved of to become that person
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00016.flac	you know travel somewhere with someone that is the real thrill i think of being an actor so
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00017.flac	in taking something on that's new i like to be a little bit afraid like fearful that i might not that is a challenge that i don't know that i'm we'll have to really streatch myself in a way to find this person to live in this person and if you're not doing that then i think you're playing it's safe and if you're playing it safe then then i think you're not in you're never putting yourself out there to fail and i think you have to fail
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00018.flac	y thin you have to fail and make a fool of yourself to grow at all as an artist you have to be realling to willing to really make mistakes otherwise
id10111_pLHg7KbMZds_00019.flac	don't ever wanna do that so when i read things i'm always looking for something that gives me that like tingle of wof like
